					Special Exhibits explore diverse topics, from stories than transcend one region or site, to explanations of technological and research methods used by archeologists. The TARL Spotlights are short Special Exhibits which focus on intriguing objects and research from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.</p>

					<a href="radiocarbon/index.html">Radiocarbon Dating Understood</a></p>
				<p>
					The radiocarbon dating method, the most relied-upon scientific dating tool used in archeology today, estimates the ages of organic materials&#8212;wood charcoal, bones, basketry, and much more. Today&#8216;s archeologists routinely send off samples to be dated, yet radiocarbon dating methods remain poorly understood by many archeologists. This exhibit explains the intricacies of radiocarbon dating to serious students of archeology and science lovers to help guide the wielding of this powerful tool.</p>

					<a href="cairn/index.html">Stone Cairns of West-Central Texas </a></p>
           		<p>
					Hundreds of rock cairns, some marking the graves of Late Prehistoric people, lie atop the mesas and stream terraces near Abilene. These mysterious features may relate to a time of interaction and conflict on the Plains, as different groups vied for resources and territory. </p>

					<a href="cabeza-cooking/index.html">Learning from Cabeza de Vaca</a></p>
            	<p>
					The earliest accounts of the native peoples of Texas were given to us by Cabeza de Vaca and his companions. Shipwrecked on the Texas Gulf Coast in 1528, these men made their way from the shores near present-day Galveston to Mexico City during a seven-year ordeal. Their reports of that amazing journey provide fascinating&#8212;albeit enigmatic&#8212;glimpses of native lifeways and the various odd-sounding foods they extracted from often harsh landscapes. Based on studies of traditional foods and cooking technologies, anthropologist and archeologist Alston Thoms infers what the various unidentified roots, tubers, nuts, fruits, and fish may have been and how they were prepared.</p>
					
				<p>
					<a href="villagers/index.html" class="text">Plains Villagers of the Texas Panhandle</a></p>
            	<p>
					Some 800 years ago, the northern Texas Panhandle was &quot;settled&quot; for the first time by Indian peoples who lived in substantial houses with stone foundations and survived by hunting, gathering, and farming. The Antelope Creek culture of the Canadian River Valley is the best known local example, but archeologists now recognize many variations on the Plains Village theme. Five exhibits help tell the unfolding story of the Plains Villagers of the Texas Panhandle.</p>

					<a href="tejas/index.html" class="text">Tejas: Life and Times of the Caddo</a></p>
				<p>
					Tejas: Life and Times of the Caddo theme exhibit with six interwoven exhibits providing an intimate look at the Caddo's long and 		distinguished history, at ancient and living Caddo tradition, and at the tribe's many contributions to the cultural heritage of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The Tejas exhibits explain who the Caddo are, who they were, where they came from, and what Caddo life was like in different points in time.</p>
