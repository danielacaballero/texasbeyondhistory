<div id="content"><!-- #BeginEditable "body" --> <img src="images/toolshead.jpg" alt="variety of stone tools" width="780" height="300"> 
      <p class="text">Texas Indians created a great variety of stone tools and 
        ornaments using many of the diverse rocks they found throughout the state 
        and sometimes materials traded from distant sources. While much attention 
        has been placed on projectile points&#151;&quot;arrowheads&quot; including 
        dart points and true arrow points&#151;many of the other kinds of stone 
        artifacts are not well known. This exhibit presents a photo gallery introducing 
        many of the kinds of stone artifacts that archeologists have identified&#151;almost 
        everything except projectile points.</p>
      <p class="text">The featured images were assembled in July 1999 for a workshop 
        on lithic (stone) artifacts sponsored by the Stewards Program of the Texas 
        Historical Commission (THC). Many of the artifacts were brought to the 
        meeting, so that the Stewards&#151;avocational archeologists who assist 
        the THC in monitoring, recording, and preserving archeological sites across 
        the state&#151;could get hands-on knowledge of some of the artifact groups. 
        This photo gallery is presented at the suggestion of a number of the Stewards 
        who thought these images ought to be posted on the Internet for future 
        reference. </p>
      <h3>Raw Material</h3>
      <p class="text">The raw material categories illustrated in these photos 
        are described in informal terms; other archeologists often have different 
        names for the raw material sources or other views on the material's distribution. 
        The best reference for raw materials in the Texas area is Dr. Larry Banks' 
        (1990) <i>From Mountain Peaks to Alligator Stomachs: A Review of Lithic 
        Sources in the Trans-Mississippi South, the Southern Plains, and Adjacent 
        Southwest</i> (Oklahoma Anthropological Society, Memoir No. 4). Unfortunately, 
        this study has been out of print for several years and may be difficult 
        to find. Where possible, I have keyed the descriptions below to Dr. Banks' 
        monograph. And, the raw material categories shown here are selective and 
        do not represent the full range of raw materials from which stone tools 
        were made in Texas. </p>
      <p class="text">The basic techniques of stone-tool making are beyond the 
        scope of this exhibit but can be found in a variety of published sources 
        and on various Web sites. The nature of the raw material often affected 
        the reduction techniques used. For example, Uvalde gravels (cobbles from 
        ancient stream deposits that are found today on hilltops and elsewhere 
        across much of the southern half of Texas) were often worked by percussion 
        and pressure techniques: percussion to shape and pressure to finish. Cobbles 
        or blanks were often &quot;heat-treated&quot; or thermally altered prior 
        to being worked. It is also thought that some of the coarse pebbles and 
        petrified wood available to the Indians of eastern Texas were reduced 
        through a technique known as bipolar reduction (see Anvil Stones below) 
        using a hammerstone to smash a cobble resting on another stone surface.</p>
      <p class="text">Where possible, data are provided on the function of specific 
        tool categories. Today &quot;use-wear&quot; studies are being conducted 
        on many types of stone tools. But this is no easy thing&#151;to determine 
        what an artifact was used for requires extensive experimentation and the 
        use of high-power microscopy. When use-wear experts look at multiple examples 
        of one type of tool, they often see a range of use-wear traces including 
        polish, striations, and several kinds of edge damage. These diverse patterns 
        suggest that some tool types were used for many different tasks. This, 
        of course, is to be expected&#151;after all, think of the tasks for which 
        we use screwdrivers. A good example of use-wear research is a 1997 study 
        by Dale Hudler, <i>Determining Clear Fork Function Through Use-Wear Analysis</i>.</p>
      <h3>Time Frames</h3>
      <p class="text">The time frame or chronology noted in some of the discussions 
        (for example, &quot;Late Archaic&quot;) is a broadly generalized one drawn 
        largely from <i>Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians</i> by Ellen Sue Turner 
        and myself (1999) and can be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
      <p class="text"><i>Paleoindian </i>(11,500-8000 years ago)<br>
        <i>Early Archaic</i> (8000-4500 years ago)<br>
        <i>Middle Archaic</i> (4500-3000 years ago)<br>
        <i>Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic</i> (3000-1300 years ago)<br>
        <i>Late Prehistoric</i> (1300-300 years ago)</p>
