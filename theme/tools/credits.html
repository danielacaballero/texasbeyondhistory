      <p class="text">The Stone Tools of Texas Indians exhibit was developed and 
        written by Dr. Thomas R. Hester. All of the photographs were taken by 
        TARL staff photographer Milton Bell. Most of the specimens are housed 
        at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.</p>
      <p class="text"><b>Tom Hester</b> is Professor of Anthropology at the University 
        of Texas at Austin and former director of the Texas Archeological Research 
        Laboratory at UT Austin as well as of the Center for Archaeological Research 
        at UT San Antonio. First and foremost a teacher, he has introduced thousands 
        of undergraduates to Texas archeology and helped hundreds of graduate 
        students complete advanced degrees. He has also always worked closely 
        with avocational archeologists and is a Fellow of the Texas Archeological 
        Society and co-founder of the Southern Texas Archaeological Society. A 
        prolific researcher and author, Hester has written and edited dozens of 
        books and hundreds of reports and articles on subjects ranging from Texas 
        archeology to stone tools, Egyptian heavy transport, Great Basin archeology, 
        California Indians, and Maya lithics. </p>
      <p class="text">Hester is an internationally recognized expert on lithic, 
        or stone tool, technology, an interest that began when he was a high school 
        student in Carrizo Springs, Texas. Throughout his career he has followed 
        this interest everywhere he has gone. In Texas, he is best known to the 
        public for the book he wrote with Ellen Sue Turner, <i>The Stone Tools 
        of Texas Indians</i>. An earlier book, <i>Digging into South Texas Prehistory</i>, 
        was one of the first popular accounts on Texas archeology. Indeed, Tom 
        Hester has traveled much of the state giving public talks to civic groups 
        and archeological societies as well as working closely with landowners. 
        Today he and wife Lynda live on the banks of the upper Seco Creek somewhere 
        west of San Antonio surrounded by burned rock middens, a common theme 
        in his long-term research efforts in south-central Texas. </p>

        The website from the University at Buffalo (New York) is the ultimate 
        resource for those interested in almost any aspect of stone tools and 
        lithic analysis. It contains links to virtually all other lithic-related 
        websites that are worth knowing about. It does not contain links to sites 
        of those who buy, sell, or trade artifacts.</p>
