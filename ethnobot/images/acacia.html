<p>  Acacias are shrubs with  stems armed with many straight or recurved spines. Acacia seeds (sometimes called beans) have been used as food in many places  around the world. In the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, the wood was likely used for toolmaking, construction, and fuel, although  no definitive archeological evidence of use has  been documented, yet. </p>
      <p>At  least 7 species of <em>Acacia</em> grow in the   region. The fruit ripens to a dry,  papery or woody bean pod that ejects several seeds. The seeds furnish the food,  but many species are toxic and require special processing.<em> </em>Some species,  such as Wright and  Gregg acacias, have recurved spines or prickles, and these are called catclaw  acacias.&nbsp; Others have straight, stout  spines such as blackbrush and huisache. See Cheatham et al. (1995) for detailed discussion of the uses and distribution of <em>Acacia</em> species found in Texas. </p>
      <p><strong>Archeological occurrence.</strong> Seeds and fruits of least three acacia have been observed in  collections from Fate Bell Shelter, and from 5,000 to 6,000 year-old deposits in Hinds Cave (Dering 1979). Both Dering and Irving (1966) list <em>Acacia berlandieri</em>, <em>Acacia rigidula</em>, and <em>Acacia roemeriana</em> in the deposits of Hinds Cave and several other Lower Pecos sites. These three species have little or no mention in the ethnographies, primarily because they did not grow in the areas where the studies were conducted. Although these archeological finds demonstrate   that the native peoples of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands made use of acacia for thousands of years, the exact uses have  not been discerned.  </p>
      <p> <strong> Food. </strong>Acacias have a worldwide  distribution and the legumes or bean pods of acacia are utilized for food  on other continents, especially Australia  (Smith 1989).&nbsp; Most acacias require  processing before they can be consumed.&nbsp; The  primary barriers to the consumption of acacia seeds are the toxins stored in them, primarily cyanogenetic glycosides that  produce illness if they aren't processed properly (Kingsbury 1964). Aboriginal Australians developed techniques that  involved heating, pounding, grinding, and leaching the acacia seeds, and each  method was adapted to the individual species being processed (Low 1989).&nbsp; Although we lack detailed ethnographic  descriptions of acacia processing in North America, similar  techniques  were doubtlessly employed  by the indigenous populations of North   America.</p>
      <p>Bean  and Saubel (1972:29) state that the Cahuilla collected the pods and ate them  either fresh or dried.&nbsp; Since the mature  pods are papery thin and brown, it is possible that &quot;fresh&quot; refers to  green pods and  &quot;dried&quot; to  ripe pods.&nbsp; At any rate, the bitterness  in the pods was reduced by parboiling them, a process involving both heating  and leaching.&nbsp; The resulting flour was  made into mush or flatcakes and consumed, much like mesquite flour (Bean and  Saubel 1972:29). The Pima utilized catclaw acacias  in the same manner (Russell 1908:76). </p>
      <p> <strong> Implements, construction, and fuel.</strong>  The Pima used the wood of catclaw acacia for making bows and for fuel (Curtin 1984:90). Catclaw brush also made very effective brush fences. The Cahuilla considered the wood to be outstanding for construction and firewood (Bean and Saubel 1972:29).</p>
