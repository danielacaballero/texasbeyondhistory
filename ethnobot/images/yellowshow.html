<h1>Yellow Show</h1>
      <p><strong><em>Amoreuxia wrightii</em> A. Gray<br>
	  
Bixaceae (Lipstick Tree Family)
    </strong></p>
      <p>Yellow show is an unusual plant, a perennial herb that grows from a large tuberous root. This is one of those mystery plants that may well have been used as a food source by the native peoples in  the Lower Pecos area. Although  we have not yet recovered direct evidence from the region, elsewhere in western North America many Indian groups consumed closely related plant species.</p>
      <p> Hodgson (2001:91) has summarized the utility of two closely related Sonoran Desert species, <em>A. gonzalezii</em> and <em>A. palmatifida</em>. Wright yellow show is a medium-sized herbaceous plant growing to about 18-inches with 1-1/2-inch palmately-lobed leaves on long petioles (stalks). The flower is larger, measuring about 1-3/4-inch, yellow, with a purple blotch at the base. The stamens are long and tipped with purple. The plants growing in the Comstock/Langtry area are much smaller than those described by Correll and Johnston (1970), but competition from invasive species like bufflegrass is a problem in the area. Yellow show growing in the upper reaches of the Rio Grande arm of Amistad Reservoir appears to bloom semi-annually, possibly  connected to the periodicity of rainfall. The tuberous root stock from which the above-ground (flowering) part of the plant  emerges would allow long dormant periods. See Cheatham et al. (1995) for  additional discussion of the uses and distribution of yellow show </em> in Texas. </p>
      <p> <strong>Archeological occurrence.</strong>  Yellow show has not been identified in the collections. It is included here  because the plant very likely was utilized; increased awareness of this probability  improves the likelihood that it will be discovered by future research. </p>
      <p><strong> Food.</strong>  Ethnographic observations of yellow show center on the Sonoran Desert species, but the form and utility of Wright yellow show conforms closely to its relatives. Every part of this plant is edible or otherwise usable (Hodgson 1989; 1993). Both Edward Palmer and H. S. Gentry have made observations regarding the use of this plant. </p>
      <p> Palmer (1878:601) noted that the Indians of Arizona prepared the roots in hot ashes, and that he also tried them  himself, finding them tasty but with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Hodgson (2001:91) relates observations of H.S. Gentry, who noted that the yellow show would be an excellent kitchen garden plant, both attractive and edible. The tender green fruits contain seeds that can be eaten raw. The green fruit of Wright yellow show likewise has very flavorful seeds. Even when the fruit matures the seeds are edible, according to Gentry. </p>
      <p> Residents  of Baja California  used yellow show as recently as the  mid-20th century. The plant grew during the summer rains and died back in drought. The local people knew where the plants grew and looked for the dried remains of the leaves and stems. The tubers are shaped like a parsnip and are very easy to cook, which means they don't have a lot of secondary metabolites that inhibit ingestion by humans (Aschmann 1959:88). </p>
      <p> The Seri ate the flowers of yellow show and the root. The plant was important to the inhabitants of the interior of Tiburon Island. They harvested the root with a digging stick, and ate it raw or cooked on ashes. They dried the root and strung it on cordage to carry it while traveling. The Seri said that the yellow show (<em>saiya</em>) sang a song about itself (Felger and Moser 1985):</p>
      <p align="center" class="style1"> We are among the blue flowers, <br>
       We are among the blue flowers <br>
       We are among them, <br>
      The dry lake is all yellow with flowers, <br>
       The wind touches us and roars. </p>
