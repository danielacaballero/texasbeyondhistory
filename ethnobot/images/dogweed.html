<h1>Dogweed, Fetid Marigold
</h1>
<p><strong><em>Dyssodia pentachaeta; Dyssodia papposa </em>(Vent.) A.S. Hitchc.<br>
Asteraceae (Sunflower/Composite Family</strong>)</p>
     <p> As the common names imply, dogweed and fetid marigold are strongly odiferous, annual or short-lived perennial herbs with finely divided leaves (Correll and Johnston 1970).  They have small, numerous and attractive yellow flowers.  There are several species of dogweed that share similar habit and the strong odor produced by this very aromatic plant. Unpleasing aroma notwithstanding, <em>Dyssodia</em> was used for medicine and food by Southwestern groups. </p>
	 <p><strong>Archeological occurrence. </strong>  <em>Dyssodia</em> is an herb that produces small achenes (seeds) which are relatively delicate and unlikely to survive in an exposed archeological sites.  Although one might be able to find  charred seeds preserved on the floor of a pithouse, evidence of the plant is much more likely to be found in dry rockshelter deposits.  This is quite possible with further research into recovered samples from rockshelter archeological deposits.  Other Asteraceae family species have been identified in rockshelters including sunflower (<em>Helianthus annuus</em>) seedheads with intact achenes and an entire mariola (<em>Parthenium incanum)</em> plant.  </p>

	 <p><strong>Food. </strong>  The leafy body of the plant and the achenes were eaten by the Chiricahua/Mescalero Apache.  The "tops" were cooked alone or with meat.  The dried flower tops were cut off and the seeds (achenes) were separated and beaten on a hide.  Using a woven tray, these seed-like fruits were winnowed or separated from the dry, prickly pappi (featherlike hairs attached to the seeds). Winnowed, the seeds were set out to dry and stored in a basket, and later   roasted whole or ground into flour as needed (Castetter 1935; Castetter and Opler 1936:48). </p>

	 <p><strong>Medicine. </strong>  Dogweed has been used by Native Americans to treat several illnesses.  The oils include camphene, a minor constituent of turpentine and camphor oil.  Recent studies of dogweed extract have shown that it can have a calming effect on the gut, limiting contractions.  It also apparently can inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens (Rojas et al. 1999).  These tests affirm many of the indigenous applications of the herb. </p>
	 <p>The Navajo considered dogweed to be "red ant medicine", that is, it cured diseases caused by red ant stings or stomach pains caused by ingesting red ants.  This also included other diseases attributed to swallowing red ants, including bladder and kidney problems.  Decoctions of <em>Dyssodia</em> were taken internally to cure these problems.  Skin lesions attributed to red ant bites were treated by applying a lotion or poultice of chewed leaves.  It was also used to treat cases of profuse sweating (Wyman and Harris 1941).  	Other possible evidence of the calming effects of the plant include the use of the plant as a rub for fever and the prevention of epileptic seizures by smoking the plant (Swank 1932).  Clearly perceived results may not always line up with the Western concept of clinical trials or controlled experiments, but <em>Dyssodia</em> was perceived to effectively treat these conditions (Camazine and Bye 1980).  </p>
	 <p><em>Dyssodia </em>is also used as a "chant lotion", and a cold infusion is rubbed on the patient's body during ceremonials, followed by a bath in the lotion.  In most cases the patient also drinks some of the lotion.  Several plants are used for this purpose, including <em>Dyssodia</em>.  The symptoms treated are fever, headache, lameness, general body aches, coughs, colds and chills (Wyman and Harris 1941). </p> 
	<p>The Brule used decoctions of<em> Dyssodia</em> and compounded it with other plants to treat various ills.  Taking advantage of the aromatic oils, the plant was crushed and inhaled (the aroma, not the plant) for headaches.  It was also mixed with gumweed (<em>Grindelia</em>) to treat bloody sputum (Rogers 1980).  </p>
	<p>Mexican folk medicine also utilized <em>Dyssodia</em>.  The branches were boiled with the flowers, and it was taken internally before meals for two to three days.  The mixture was taken for stomach aches and constipation in northern Mexico, including San Luis Potosi, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon.  It was also considered to have the ability to sooth a cough.  A decoction was also taken internally, in larger quantities, as a purgative (Ford 1975; Martinez 1969).  </p>

	<p><strong>Other uses. </strong>
  There are several other known uses related to the inherent qualities of <em>Dyssodia</em>.  The Tarahumara considered <em>Dyssodia</em> to be an excellent fish poison, and they would crush the leaves and toss them into pools where fish were trapped during the dry season.  They said that it would require only a small amount in a large pool to bring the fish to the surface.  Apparently the oils (or perhaps the aroma) were effective cleaning agents, because the Tarahumara would pound the plants into a mush and smear them on cotton clothing and blankets and soak them in water for several hours (Pennington 1963).  </p>
