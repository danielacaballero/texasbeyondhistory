        <h2>A Site By Any Other Name (or Number)? </h2>
        <p>Readers may wonder about the abbreviated numbers noted in parentheses 
          from time to time in this section such as &quot;Arenosa Shelter (VV99).&quot; 
          Wonder no more. Archeological sites are always assigned unique site 
          numbers, and may or may not have names. </p>
        <p>Most archeologists name the sites they excavate or study in detail. 
          sites are named for landowners, landscape features, and various other 
          namesakes and the names may not be unique or easy to reference. In Texas 
          alone, for example, there are dozens of sites that have the name &quot;Smith&quot; 
          as part of the site name. But many sites never get named&#8212;a large archeological 
          survey may record hundreds of sites, most of which are never excavated. 
          So to keep track of all the sites archeologists identify, we use individual 
          site numbers. </p>
        <p>Since the 1950s archeologists have assigned a unique number to each 
          site they record using a simple and flexible numbering system developed 
          by the Smithsonian Institution. In brief, each site is assigned a three-part 
          number that gives the site a unique identification number that avoids 
          confusion between site localities. This site number is used on all site 
          records, field notes, and collection bags and is a critical reference. 
        </p>
        <p>For example, the famous Amistad site known as Arenosa Shelter is formally 
          known as 41VV99. Texas was the 41st state at the time the Smithsonian 
          Trinomial System was devised. VV stands for Val Verde County. And, Arenosa 
          was the 99th site officially recorded in Val Verde County, Texas. </p>
        <p>On this website, we prefer to use site names because names are more 
          memorable than numbers. Nonetheless, serious students of archeology 
          who seek further information about a particular site need to know the 
          site number because that is how all the site records and collections 
          are stored at archeological repositories such as the Texas Archeological 
          Research Laboratory (TARL), publisher of  this website. To make 
          cross-referencing easier for the serious readers, we have included a 
          short version of the site numbers when we discuss each of the major 
          named sites investigated during the Amistad salvage program. Since all 
          of the sites discussed in this section are in Texas, we'll simply note 
          the abbreviate version in parentheses. For example, &quot;Arenosa Shelter 
          (VV99).&quot;</p>
