<h1>Purlsane, Verdolaga
</h1>
<p><strong><em>Portulaca oleracea</em> L.; <em>Portuluaca mundula</em> I. M. Johnston<br>
Portulcaceae (Purslane Family</strong>)</p>
     <p> Purslane is a small, prostrate fleshy or succulent annual herb widely used for food; it also had medicinal uses.  The branches spread along the ground radially from the central root (Correll and Johnston 1970).  Once thought to be introduced, purslane is now known to be a native plant with cosmopolitan distribution (Byrne and McAndrews 1975).  The plant can germinate throughout the growing season, which can last over 300 days in southern Texas/northern Mexico.  This makes purslane a valuable source of fresh greens throughout the growing season, because greens are consumed while the plants are only a few weeks old.  </p>

	 <p><strong>Archeological Occurrence. </strong>  Purslane seeds are commonly recovered from archeological sites throughout the greater Southwest and western Texas (Dering  2001; 2006; Dering et al. 2000; Holloway 2005).  Purslane has yet to be identified from rockshelters in the Lower Pecos region, most likely because the earliest studies were conducted on screened samples (Irving 1966) and later studies were conducted on small samples from a single location (Dering 1979; 1999).  The seeds of purslane measure no more than 1-mm and only unscreened samples of rockshelter deposits will be able to detect its presence.  </p>


	 <p><strong>Food. </strong>  Purslane, or verdolaga, greens are consumed as a vegetable and the seeds are ground into meal or flour (Hodgson 2001).  The Tarahumara collected and consumed several different types of greens including goosefoot, pigweed, mustard, peppergrass, in addition to verdolaga.  The greens were gathered during a point in the growth cycle when the nutrients in the plants peaked (Bye 1981).  Verdolaga contains an abundance of Vitamins A and C.  A short list of Southwestern groups that were observed to collect members of this versatile genus includes the Laguna, the Isleta and other Pueblo groups, the Navajo, the Ramah Navajo, the Tewa, the Chiricahua/Mescalero Apache, Pima, and the Tarahumara, (Castetter 1935; Castetter and Opler 1936; Pennington 1963; Vestal 1952).  </p>
	 <p>In an interesting twist (since one thinks of greens as being consumed fresh) some groups dried the greens for storage and reconstituted them for winter use (Jones 1931; Pennington 1963).  Whether fresh or reconstituted, the greens were used as a pot herb and added to stews and soups, or cooked with onions, tomatoes, and chiles (Castetter 1935). 	Verdolaga is continues to be collected or cultivated in small kitchen gardens today in Mexico (Bye 1980; Weiss 1994).  One Tipai Cochimi said that it made him "strong".  At any rate, one method of preparation is to boil the greens for 15 minutes with onions, tomatoes and chicharrones.  Even when sautéed, verdolaga is apparently boiled first. (Weiss 1994). </p>
	<p>The seeds also were consumed, by the hundreds of thousands.  Mature plants were plucked from the ground and the tiny seeds were dislodged by beating  into tighly woven baskets.  The Pima gathered large quantities of seeds and ground them into flour (Russell 1908).  The Zuni gathered the entire plant before the fruits ejected the seeds, stacked the plants on large mats, and waited for the seeds to drop (Cushing 1974). </p>


	<p><strong>Medicine. </strong>  The healing power of <em>Portulaca </em>comes from its ability to contract wounds, likely a property of the gelatinous hydrocolloids in the fleshy leaves (Rashed et al. 2003).  It also contains noradrenaline and dopamine, and has demonstrated analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy in topical treatments (Chan et al. 2000) </p>

	<p>The leaves and sap from the plants were used in several medicinal applications.  The Keres used an infusion of the leaves for diarrhea.  Other gastrointestinal problems such as worms were treated with a decoction of purslane (Hamel and Chiltoskey 1975).  The Navajo also treated stomach aches with the plant, using it in an unspecified manner (Elmore 1944).  The Navajo took advantage of perceived analgesic properties and applied the poultice areas in pain (Elmore 1944).  They also applied the same type of infusion externally to wounds as an antiseptic.  The sap was poured into the ear to cure earaches (Swank 1932).  In conclusion, the indigenous medicinal uses of  <em>Portulaca</em> appear to take advantage of the qualities of the plant as a calmative, a vasoconstrictor, an anti-inflammatory agent, and a pain killer.  </p>
