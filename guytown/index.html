                <td valign="top" width="372" height="1809"><br>
            <p class="text">In 1876, the Austin <em>Daily Statesman</em> reported 
              that two women arrested for keeping a brothel had threatened to 
              divulge who their frequent clients were. The article playfully added 
              that &quot;several high-toned gentlemen [were] quaking in their 
              boots.&quot; The women were denizens of Austin's Guy Town, the infamous 
              red-light district that blossomed during the last quarter of the 
              nineteenth century. Their clients were city council members, legislators, 
              and businessmen who tacitly supported business in Guy Town through 
              their continued patronage. Their stories unfold along with those 
              of others who helped build Austin in the nineteenth and twentieth 
              centuries.</p>
            <p class="text">The saga of Guy Town is the story of Tom Callahan, 
              a rowdy young police officer in 1884 who became involved with a 
              prostitute and found himself on the wrong side of the law one too 
              many times. It is the story of Mollie King, a dishonored woman in 
              her twenties who struggled to live down the shame of an out-of-wedlock 
              child. The end to that struggle came one spring morning in 1912, 
              when she was murdered by her lover behind the Piper Saloon. It is 
              the story of a former slave named Caroline Robinson, who purchased 
              property in 1867 along Second Street where she lived quietly with 
              her white lover and their child. And it is also the story of the 
              enterprising Schneider family, the saloon-owning Metz clan, the 
              Italian immigrant Cuneo family, and the debt-riddled Bozeths. Indeed, 
              between 1876 and 1913, the neighborhood known as Guy Town served 
              as the backdrop for countless human dramas involving not just prostitutes, 
              gamblers, and drinkers, but laundresses, housekeepers, lawyers, 
              engineers, junk dealers, blacksmiths, masons, and saloon porters. 
              All of these formed the small First Ward community located near 
              the river, just west of Congress Avenue; today this area has given 
              way to high-rise office buildings and apartments. </p>
            <h3><a name="excavations"></a>Excavations Span Four City Blocks</h3>
            <p class="text">Hicks &amp; Company has been conducting archeological 
              investigations of Guy Town as part of Austin's downtown redevelopment 
              initiative. Excavations have spanned four city blocks, including 
              the block where the city plans to build its new city hall. Integrating 
              detailed historical research with archeological investigations, 
              the project has provided unique insights not only into one of the 
              more notorious aspects of the city's past, but also into a residential 
              neighborhood peopled by an ethnically and economically diverse population. 
              Investigations have uncovered over 100 features pertaining to both 
              businesses and residences in the project area. Types of features 
              include foundations, wells, cisterns, privies, trash pits, and yardscape 
              features. These features were built and shared by a dynamic community 
              of individuals whose ethnic and economic backgrounds were as diverse 
              as their various trades. </p>
                  <p class="text"> In an on-site lab, archeologists  processed 
                    more than 10,000 artifacts representing not only the business 
                    of Guy Town but also the everyday lives of hundreds of residents 
                    who made this neighborhood their home. The personal effects 
                    they left behind serve as a compelling document of their unwritten 
                    history. A dog license from 1898 is a poignant reminder of 
                    a long-lost pet; an axe head and a tatting needle illustrate 
                    the type of daily work performed by one-time residents; a 
                    spur recalls the mythic cattle ranching industry; broken and 
                    discarded toys attest to the sorts of games children played; 
                    and a conch shell, perhaps a memento from a trip to the sea, 
                    gives us a sense of someone's decorative aesthetic. Alongside 
                    these more-mundane symbols of everyday life lie the artifacts 
                    of red light activities and the business of Guy Town&#151;devices 
                    used for women's birth control, fancy cut-glass goblets, bar 
                    tokens, dice, and hundreds of empty beer, wine, and whisky 
                    bottles. Ongoing research and analysis will continue to bring 
                    the Guy Town community into focus and, in the process, create 
                    a fascinating collage of a nineteenth-century urban neighborhood.
