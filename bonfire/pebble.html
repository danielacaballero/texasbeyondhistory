    <td width="372" valign="top">  <h3>The Painted Pebble Cache</h3>
            <p class="text">One of archeologist Elton Prewitt's favorite memories 
              of his experiences at Bonfire Shelter during the original 1963-1964 
              excavations is the finding of a cache of the painted pebbles you 
              see here. Painted pebbles are relatively small rocks, usually stream-worn 
              flat stones, which have painted designs on one or both faces. The 
              designs are usually painted with a black pigment (probably a mineral 
              paint made of manganese), but red, white, and yellow colors were 
              sometimes used. Painted pebbles are fairly common in the Lower Pecos 
              and adjacent areas of southern Texas where dry conditions favor 
              the preservation of paint. Although they are often referred to as 
              portable &quot;art,&quot; painted pebbles were probably prized because 
              of their symbolic value rather than their artistic qualities. </p>
            <p class="text">Early in January, 1964, Prewitt was placed in charge 
              of one of the 10-foot-excavation units near the center of the shelter. 
              His assignment was to make sure that the excavations were done properly 
              and to document in the field notes every detail about what was found. 
              The young archeologist had been striving to take good notes after 
              being chastised earlier in the project by Field Director Dave Dibble. 
              Dibble was a stickler for careful work and thorough documentation, 
              much more so than other archeologists Prewitt had worked under.</p>
            <p class="text">As the excavations in this particular unit progressed, 
              very little was found in the upper part of the deposits (the first 
              foot or so). Prewitt remembers struggling to come up with &quot;something 
              to say about nothing.&quot; But as he was learning, to an archeologist 
              nothing is often just as important as something. For example, the 
              fact that no artifacts were found in a given layer in the Bonfire 
              deposits usually means that this layer represents a period during 
              which prehistoric peoples did not visit the site. Bonfire Shelter 
              is unusual among large rockshelters in the Lower Pecos region because 
              it experienced only occasional use. Most large shelters were used 
              over and over again, such that one occupation layer becomes mixed 
              with the next. Therefore, the finding of layers with nothing in 
              them was critically important to the overall interpretation of the 
              Bonfire site.</p>
            <p class="text">As the excavations reached the depth of the Fiber 
              Layer, the first occupation zone at Bonfire, Prewitt and his crew 
              encountered a small cluster of three stream-worn rocks. At first 
              glance these appeared to be ordinary river pebbles. But the young 
              archeologist realized that these three rocks must have been placed 
              there intentionally because there were no stream deposits in the 
              upper part of the shelter. He resisted the temptation to flip over 
              the three rocks because he knew that he should document the find 
              before disturbing it. Instead, he dutifully described what he found 
              in his field notes, had Roy Little take several photographs (Little 
              served as backup photographer to Dibble), and drew a sketch showing 
              the exact location of the rocks. It was only then that he was ready 
              to see what he had found.</p>
            <p class="text">When he carefully turned over the central rock, he 
              saw the vivid design of a &quot;painted pebble,&quot; not once but 
              twice. Twice? The <a href="images/mb16.html" class="text" target="_blank">black 
              painted design of the artifact</a> you see here was visible on the 
              pebble and in the soil where the artifact had lain undisturbed for 
              over a thousand years. The other two rocks were laying painted side 
              up, but the paint was so faint that it was scarcely visible until 
              after the artifacts were cleaned. One of the other pebbles appears 
              to have an anthropomorphic (human-like) central figure similar to 
              the so-called Shaman figures often found in Lower Pecos rock art. 
              Most of the design on the third pebble is no longer visible.</p>
            <p class="text">Recognizing the unusual nature of the find, Prewitt 
              pondered how he could preserve both the artifacts and the painted 
              impressions in the soil. Back at the field camp in Comstock, he 
              scavenged a triple-wide aluminum ice tray. The next day at the shelter, 
              he dug around the painted pebbles, leaving them on a raised pedestal 
              or block of soil. Undercutting this, he slipped the aluminum tray 
              under the block of soil. Plaster of Paris was used to jacket the 
              block, and the solidified mass was carefully placed in a Lone Star 
              longneck box, a waxed cardboard box that once held 24 bottles of 
              beer. Today the painted pebble soil block is housed at the Texas 
              Archeological Research Laboratory where it awaits the examination 
              of some future researcher.</p>
            <p><span class="text">It appears that the central pebble, the one 
              with the most vivid design both on the rock and in the dirt, had 
              been freshly painted not long before it was cached. If this can 
              be demonstrated by more-careful research and comparison of the pebbles 
              and the adjacent soil, the cache and its unusual burial might be 
              better understood. What is the significance of three painted pebbles 
              found together? Why was a freshly painted pebble placed along with 
              a presumably &quot;old&quot; one and a &quot;not-so-new&quot; one? 
              While such &quot;why&quot; questions are inherently difficult to 
              answer, comparisons with other archeological finds of painted pebbles 
              may offer insights into this most intriguing cultural practice. 
              If you are interested in painted pebbles, you will find more examples 
              of them in the <a href="../pecos/index.html" class="text">Lower 
              Pecos exhibit</a>.</span></p>
