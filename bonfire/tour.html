          <td><p class="text">By Steve Black </p>
            <p class="text">One spring morning I had the privilege of joining 
              a small group on a tour of Mile Canyon. Leading the tour were landowner 
              Jack Skiles and archeologist Elton Prewitt, who was on the excavation 
              crew during the original 1963-64 excavations at Bonfire Shelter. 
              There aren't many ways into and out of Mile Canyon and all of them 
              require strenuous climbing. We start at the top of a ravine that 
              plunges into the canyon. At the goat pens at the top of the trail 
              Elton warns us to watch for &quot;dog cactus,&quot; a small ball 
              of wicked thorns that tends to fasten itself to your pants leg or 
              boot heel. As you walk along, the dog cactus can get flipped upwards 
              becoming attached to the seat of your pants! Elton relates a painful 
              occasion in 1963 when this happened to him at the end of a long 
              hot day. Unaware, he sat down hard on a rear bench seat of a Carryall 
              and instantly dented the roof with his head. I laughed at the story, 
              but kept an eye out for dog cactus.</p>
            <p class="text">As we walked along, Jack Skiles told me that his late 
              father, Guy Skiles, had purchased Mile Canyon and the immediate 
              surroundings in 1944. As a young man Guy Skiles had dug into many 
              of the caves and shelters in the area in search of interesting Indian 
              artifacts. But rather than sell these items off, as many diggers 
              did, Guy created his own private museum. As he grew older, Guy Skiles 
              learned to appreciate how much more can be learned through a scientific 
              approach and befriended many of the archeologists who have worked 
              in the region. During the Skiles family's tenure, no one has dug 
              into the rockshelters of Mile Canyon except for scientists. Jack 
              Skiles inherited his father's curiosity about the past and went 
              to college and graduate school where he earned a Master's degree 
              in botany. While a high school science teacher, Jack received a 
              grant from the National Science Foundation that allowed him to attend 
              the University of Texas for one year and bone up on other sciences 
              including geology and archeology. While attending UT in 1961, Jack 
              invited archeologists to come take a look at the cave on his property 
              containing burned bison bones.</td>

                    of other sites in the area prior to the damming of Amistad 
                    Reservoir. Here the group looks for the small dark green &quot;V 
                    V numbers&quot; &#151;Val Verde County site numbers&#151;which 
                    archeologists painted in each cave and rockshelter they recorded. 
                    During the survey work, small teams of archeologists spent 
                    many months combing the canyons for sites and they sometimes 
                    lost track of which shelters they had visited. The V V numbers 
                    helped avoid confusion.</p>

                    we entered Mile Canyon. The large boulders you see here may 
                    look like permanent fixtures, but once or twice a century 
                    raging floodwaters move even house-sized boulders. Each catastrophic 
                    flood changes the topography of the canyon, spring-fed pools 
                    become choked with gravels, new springs emerge, and walnut 
                    trees are ripped out. Such events would have impacted the 
                    lives of the Lower Pecos hunter-gatherers and caused shifts 
                    in settlement patterns that may have lasted for several generations.</p>
