    <td width="372">   <p class="text">Bone Bed 2 is the complex deposit of bison bones dating 
              to at least 11,300 years ago (9300 B.C.), during Paleoindian times. 
              This deposit covers most of the southern half of Bonfire Shelter 
              and continues downslope outside the shelter's mouth. The finding 
              of 10 Paleoindian dart points and fragments, as well as other chipped-stone 
              tools, and one small hearth amid the bones leaves no doubt that 
              humans were responsible for creating Bone Bed 2. </p>
            <p class="text">The upper surface of Bone Bed 2 parallels the modern 
              surface of the shelter and is covered by 4-8 ft (1.2-2.4 m) of cave 
              sediments and cultural layers including Bone Bed 3 and the Fiber 
              Layer. Bone Bed 2 is thickest (about 1.5 ft or 46 cm) at the foot 
              of the steep slope of the talus cone (directly beneath the cleft 
              in the cliff above) and gradually thins to the north and toward 
              the rear of the shelter. It covers an area measuring at least 50-x-140 
              ft (15-x-43 m). </p>
            <p class="text">Through excavations and analyses of the findings, 
              a number of interesting insights have emerged.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Bone Bed 2 was once much larger.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Many of the buffalo that were driven off the cliff 
              must have fallen on the outer slopes of the talus cone and came 
              to rest outside the protective overhanging roof of the shelter. 
              In other words, the preserved portion of Bone Bed 2 probably represents 
              only half or less of the extent of the original layers of bones 
              as they existed at the time they were formed. Although bone fragments 
              can still be seen eroding from the talus slope below Bonfire Shelter, 
              most of the bones and debris that covered the area have been destroyed 
              by natural erosion and weathering. Nonetheless, what was left in 
              the shelter is a most impressive and informative deposit.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Bone Bed 2 represents at least three jump events.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Excavators have been able to distinguish three separate, 
              overlapping layers of bone in Bone Bed 2 that formed as the result 
              of at least three separate bison jump events. This phenomenon is 
              particularly evident in deposits at the south end of the shelter, 
              on and near the talus cone. The 1963-1964 excavators were not able 
              to consistently separate the three layers in toward the rear of 
              the shelter and northward from the talus cone area. With better 
              lighting, the 1983-1984 excavators were able to distinguish all 
              three layers in the central area of the shelter. During the 1963-1964 
              work, the middle layer in the vicinity of the talus cone was observed 
              to consist of heavily burned and fire-fractured bone, similar to 
              that in Bone Bed 3, whereas the upper and lower layers of Bone Bed 
              2 were unburned. Lacking any evidence of intentional burning, archeologist 
              Dave Dibble reasoned that the Bone Bed 2 burn event was also the 
              result of spontaneous combustion like that of Bone Bed 3.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>The bones of a young horse were found in the 
                lowest part of Bone Bed 2.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">The lowest portion of Bone Bed 2 also contained the 
              bones of at least one horse. The single horse bone found in the 
              1963-1964 work was interpreted as probably being an intrusive bone 
              from Bone Bed 1. But the later excavators found a series of horse 
              bones including teeth, long bones, and skull fragments clustered 
              together at the contact between the lowest two layers of Bone Bed 
              2. Its age at death was determined to be between one- and one-and 
              one-half-years old. Whether this animal was swept up in one of the 
              buffalo stampedes or introduced into the site is unknown. </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Bone Bed 2 is at least 11,300 years old and 
                may have formed over 2,000 years.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Three radiocarbon assays on charcoal from a small 
              hearth in the uppermost layer of Bone Bed 2 and a fourth assay also 
              on scattered charcoal from the same layer indicate that the last 
              jump event occurred sometime between about 9300 to10,150 B.C. or 
              about 11,300-12,150 years ago. These overlapping assays provide 
              end dates; the lower two layers were deposited earlier, but how 
              much so is unknown. Some evidence comes from the artifacts. Five 
              essentially complete and five fragmentary Paleoindian dart points 
              were found in Bone Bed 2, including one <a href="images/mb1.html" target="_blank" class="text">Folsom 
              point</a> from the lowest layer and four points classified as Plainview 
              points, one of which (second from right) came from the uppermost 
              layer. Noted Paleoindian lithic expert, Mike Collins, believes that 
              two of the fragmentary specimens may be Clovis points, including 
              one that was found in the lowest layer (white specimen on right). 
              He also identifies one of the so-called Plainview points as a <a href="images/mb3.html" class="text" target="_blank">Midland 
              point</a>, a type thought to occur at the same time as Folsom (ca.10,000 
              -11,000 years ago or 8,000 - 9,000 B.C.). </p>
            <p class="text">Taken together, the radiocarbon assays, the diverse 
              set of Paleoindian points, and the presence of three distinct layers 
              with different matrices, suggest that Bone Bed 2 may have formed 
              as the result of at least three jump episodes that may span as much 
              as 2,000 years. As Dave Dibble emphasized, several jumps closely 
              spaced in time may have contributed to the formation of any one 
              layer without leaving any surviving evidence; thus more than three 
              jump episodes may have taken place. </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Bone Bed 2 is the earliest and southernmost 
                bison jump in North America.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Today, over 30 years after the first report on Bonfire 
              Shelter was published, Bone Bed 2 remains the earliest and southernmost 
              example of a definitive buffalo jump. At the time the site was first 
              published, archeologists familiar with the Northern Plains dismissed 
              the evidence from Bonfire and argued that the technique of organized 
              bison drives was not used until the first millennium B.C. Even today 
              a website developed by the <a href="http://parkscanada.pch.gc.ca/unesco/HEAD/Head_e.htm" target="_blank" class="text">Canada 
              national park system</a> shows the purported distribution of bison 
              jump sites as strictly a phenomenon of the Northern Plains. The 
              idea that Paleoindians were not capable of orchestrating jumps and 
              other highly organized mass kills has been shredded by the discovery 
              and documentation of numerous locales in the southern Plains including 
              the Olsen-Chubbock site in eastern Colorado and the Cooper site 
              in Northwest Oklahoma.</p>
            <p class="text">In a 1970 article in Plains Anthropologist, Dibble 
              reported new information on Bonfire, including two additional radiocarbon 
              assays (only one was available when the original report was issued) 
              which confirmed the Paleoindian age of Bone Bed 2. He also reviewed 
              his argument that Bone Bed 2 was indeed the result of at least three 
              carefully orchestrated drives as opposed to random events. At the 
              time, the prevailing notion was that small groups of highly nomadic 
              hunters roamed vast distances searching for big game and sometimes 
              got lucky. Dibble felt that the evidence at Bonfire was of &quot;an 
              effective exploitive technique&quot; which would have required the 
              cooperation of a relatively large number of people acting in concert 
              and having, as he put it, &quot;extra-familial authority structure.&quot; 
              In other words, this was not the work of a few unsophisticated family 
              bands who got lucky, but that of a larger social group who carefully 
              selected the place, targeted a particular herd, stampeded and directed 
              the animals in some ingenious fashion, and who efficiently processed 
              the meat, hides, and bones of their kill. Today few would argue 
              with this interpretation, but at the time Dibble was pushing the 
              interpretive window; most archeologists of the day were much more 
              concerned with artifact typology than social organization.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Only a small group of chipped-stone artifacts 
                was recovered from Bone Bed 2. </b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">In addition to the 10 whole and fragmentary projectile 
              points mentioned above, there were 11 other stone tools and 17 unworked 
              flakes, for a total of only 38 chipped stone artifacts. The other 
              11 stone tools included two small bifaces of uncertain use (they 
              seem too small to have been useful as knives), five simple flake 
              scrapers, and three small flake tools. It is likely that some or 
              most of the 17 unworked flakes were also used as expedient (informal, 
              or disposable) tools.</p>
            <p class="text">Taken together, this is not an impressive artifact 
              assemblage. A much larger number of chipped stone tools must have 
              been used during the butchering of the estimated 120 animals represented 
              by Bone Bed 2. Where are these missing tools? Since less than 50% 
              of the deposit was excavated, we can speculate that some artifacts 
              are still present in the unexcavated portions of Bone Bed 2. However, 
              unless the stone tool distribution was quite uneven, with most concentrated 
              in the unexcavated area, it would seem that more tools should have 
              been found, especially relatively large knives and/or heavy butchering 
              tools. The most likely explanation is that the better tools were 
              taken out of the shelter when the butchers left. </p>
