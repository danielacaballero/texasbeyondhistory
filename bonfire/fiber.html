    <td width="372" valign="top"> <h3><a name="overview"></a>Fiber Layer Overview</h3>
            <p class="text">The &quot;Fiber Layer&quot; was the uppermost, hence 
              youngest, cultural layer in Bonfire Shelter (save for the scattered 
              goat bones and tin cans on the surface). Rarely more than 3.5inches 
              (9 cm) in thickness, the Fiber Layer was present only in the southern 
              end of the shelter, as can be seen in several of the <a href="map.html" class="text" target="_blank">profile 
              drawings</a>. Unfortunately, there are no good color pictures of 
              this layer; a black and white picture gives some indication of what 
              the layer looked like when first encountered. </p>
            <p class="text">As the name implies, the Fiber Layer was a dense and 
              compressed accumulation of plant fibers, leaves, and seeds from 
              grasses, lechuguilla, yucca, sotol, and various other plants. While 
              some plant material may have been brought into the shelter by pack 
              rats or other rodents, most of it was clearly the result of human 
              occupation. Along with the plant remains were the broken bones of 
              deer, rabbit, rock squirrel, and fish along with charcoal, ash, 
              fire-cracked stones, and various chipped stone artifacts. Such materials 
              were brought into the cave while people were temporarily living 
              in it about 1350-1650 years ago (about A.D. 350-650). Many other 
              rockshelters and caves in the vicinity have extensive layers of 
              plant materials, showing that people often used these places. But 
              the thinness of the Fiber Layer at Bonfire suggests that people 
              only occasionally visited the rockshelter.</p>
            <p class="text">Why wasn't Bonfire a favored place to live? While 
              we will never know for certain, there are several factors that make 
              Bonfire less than desirable. For one thing, the floor of the shelter 
              tends to stay damp because the roof blocks at the mouth of the shelter 
              block out most of the sunlight and prevent water from draining out. 
              Because it faces northwest, cold north winds howl through the shelter 
              in the winter. As the archeologists have learned firsthand, Bonfire 
              stays noticeably cooler than the surrounding area, an advantage 
              only in the hot months. But when it is hot, the roof blocks prevent 
              the prevailing southeastern winds from circulating freely in the 
              shelter and trap smoke from cooking fires in the cave, making it 
              hard to breath. All in all, Bonfire would have been relatively cool, 
              dark, dank, and smoky. Not far downstream, however, are several 
              shelters that have ideal orientations for both summer and winter 
              occupations. At Eagle Cave, the tremendously deep layers of fiber 
              and discarded cooking stones provide dramatic evidence that it was 
              long a favored living place.</p>
            <p class="text">Nonetheless, Bonfire was used as an occupation shelter 
              at least occasionally many centuries after it was last used as a 
              jump site. Most of the Fiber Layer is concentrated at the southern 
              end of the shelter, around the base of the talus cone. This end 
              of the cave is the only part that gets any sun, especially during 
              the winter months when the sun is low in the southern sky. This 
              suggests that perhaps the shelter was occupied during the winter 
              months. Several shallow cooking pits (called &quot;hearths&quot;) 
              were found within the Fiber Layer, showing that people sometimes 
              stopped in the shelter to rest and cook something to eat. </p>
            <p class="text">The most interesting cooking pit is Hearth 6, seen 
              here completely exposed and after it had been<a href="images/VV218-C173.html" target="_blank" class="text"> 
              partially excavated</a> and <a href="images/VV218-C177.html" target="_blank" class="text">cross-sectioned</a> 
              (cut in half). The hearth was reused on at least three different 
              occasions as shown by successive layers of cooking stones, charcoal 
              and ash that were nested together one atop the other. The first 
              and largest layer was a shallow pit or basin about 3.7 ft (1.1 m) 
              in diameter, partially lined with thin limestone slabs. This almost 
              certainly represents a roasting pit or earth oven within which the 
              bulbs or &quot;hearts&quot; of lechuguilla and/or sotol plants were 
              placed in a layered arrangement. This consisted of layers of heated 
              stones and green plants (to create steam and to keep the bulbs clean) 
              capped with a thick layer of earth to hold in the heat. Other evidence 
              in the Fiber Layer of plant roasting comes from cut, burned sotol 
              leaves and several quids. Quids are small wads of fiber representing 
              basal sotol and lechuguilla leaves that have been chewed and spit 
              out, much like artichoke leaves. The last cooking episode, represented 
              by the relatively small concentration of rocks near the center of 
              the overall mass, may have been a simple fire for warmth or cooking. 
            </p>
            <p class="text"><a name="back"></a>The most exciting find made within 
              the Fiber Layer was a small cache of painted pebbles, three small, 
              flat stones with tantalizingly faded designs. The discovery of the 
              <a href="pebble.html" class="text">Painted Pebble Cache</a> by young 
              archeologist Elton Prewitt is a story in itself and illustrates 
              how a cautious, meticulous approach in excavating small finds can 
              have big payoffs. But several other interesting artifacts were found. 
              There was a small handful of dart heads, all of them dating from 
              the Late Archaic period, including several Castroville points similar 
              to those found in Bone Bed 3 and several smaller points including 
              examples of the Fairland and Ensor styles. A small pendant found 
              in the layer was made of mussel shell from a freshwater clam, probably 
              plucked from the nearby Rio Grande. Several charred wood fragments 
              fit together to form the hook end of an atlatl or throwing stick 
              (see Glossary entry: atlatl). Two sandals fashioned out of lechuguilla 
              leaves were found at the back of the shelter, one lying beside the 
              other. Although many sandals and sandal fragments have been found 
              in area caves and shelters, they are seldom found in matched pairs. 
              And while both these had been worn-one more than the other-they 
              still had some useful life left in them. Perhaps the sandals were 
              purposefully left behind as a backup pair in favor of a newly fashioned 
              set. If so, the former owner never came back to claim them, and 
              they remained to be found and documented by archeologists more than 
              a thousand years later. </p>
