            <p class="text">The archeologists who have worked at Bonfire Shelter 
              include some of the most influential and colorful individuals who 
              have worked in Texas archeology. Here are highlights of the professional 
              careers of several of the key players. </p>
            <p class="text"><a name="Dibble"></a>The late <b>Dr. David S. Dibble</b>&#151;Dave, 
              as he preferred to be known&#151;directed the original 1963-1964 
              fieldwork at Bonfire Shelter. Born and raised in Utah, Dibble came 
              to Texas specifically to work at Bonfire. He arrived in late summer 
              in 1963 during a particularly hot, humid spell and, as he would 
              later claim, almost decided on the spot to turn around and go back 
              to Utah after stepping off the Greyhound bus into the oppressive 
              midday heat of an August day in Austin. Happily, the archeological 
              lure of the unexplored Bone Cave (as Bonfire was then known) took 
              hold, and he spent most of the remaining years of his life in Texas. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Prior to arriving in Texas, Dibble had earned his 
              B.A. degree at the University of Utah and studied at the University 
              of California at Berkeley. But his most critical archeological training 
              was a five-year stint (1959-1963) as a staff archeologist on the 
              Upper Colorado River Basin Archeological Salvage Project under famed 
              archeologist Jessie D. Jennings. There, Dibble helped carry out 
              survey and excavations in Glen Canyon, Utah, and the Flaming Gorge 
              and Fontenelle Reservoir basins in Wyoming prior to their inundation. 
              During this period he had the opportunity to take part in excavations 
              of several major rockshelter and cave sites and developed an appreciation 
              of both the promise and challenge of sheltered archeological sites&#151;excellent 
              preservation, but deep, complex stratigraphy and difficult logistics. 
              While at Glen Canyon, he became friends with Dee Ann Suhm (later 
              Story) who later would help recruit Dibble for the Bonfire job.</p>
            <p class="text">After directing the excavation of Bonfire Shelter 
              from 1963-1964, Dibble took on the excavation of Arenosa Shelter, 
              a spectacularly stratified site near the confluence of the Pecos 
              and the Rio Grande rivers. This site was even more challenging than 
              Bonfire and, in many ways, of even greater archeological importance 
              because it contained over 12.8 meters (42 feet) of alternating layers 
              of flood deposits and cultural layers. Most of the work has never 
              been reported, however, as Dibble died before completing his long-planned 
              tome. While working intermittently at Arenosa from 1965-1968, Dave 
              supervised the work of Elton Prewitt and other archeologists at 
              a series of sites in the Amistad Reservoir area. He took time off 
              from 1966-1967 to do graduate work at Washington State University, 
              eventually earning his Ph.D. in 1975 with a dissertation on the 
              Bonfire work. </p>
            <p class="text">In 1970, Dibble became director of the Texas Archeological 
              Survey, successor to the Texas Archeological Salvage Project and 
              spent the next 15 years administering contracted research projects 
              carried out all across Texas. Many excellent research projects and 
              reports were generated by this work, and he gave many young archeologists 
              the opportunity to earn a living and gain precious experience doing 
              what they loved. </p>
            <p class="text">When Dibble headed southwest for a final stint at 
              Bonfire in 1983, he left the troubled world of contract archeology 
              behind him and entered his true domain, the Lower Pecos. He was 
              a dirt archeologist in the finest sense of the term, preferring 
              fieldwork to almost all other things. A quiet, soft-spoken man, 
              he was fond of saying, &quot;The answer is in the dirt,&quot; meaning 
              in part that, rather than speculate endlessly about what might be, 
              he would rather dig and find out. Over the years, he learned the 
              archeology of the region like no one before him or since, never 
              losing the wonder of such a stunning wealth of archeological riches 
              amid the stony heat and chiseled canyons. His unassuming ways, weather-beaten 
              appearance, and willingness to listen and learn from old ranchers 
              and young Mexican-American workers alike opened many gates. </p>
            <p class="text">Dibble's professional career and life was cut short 
              by poor health. Major surgery forced him to retire prematurely in 
              1984 and placed severe limits on his activities. David S. Dibble 
              died of a heart attack in 1993 at the age of 65. But the archeological 
              legacy he left behind continues to bear fruit. Many active archeologists 
              in Texas and elsewhere trace back their passion for dirt archeology 
              to field time spent with Dibble. The chronological scheme he worked 
              out for the Lower Pecos is still in use today. His dream of returning 
              to Bonfire and exploring Bone Bed I and what might lie below was 
              accomplished by Solveig Turpin and her team with Dibble serving 
              as Principal Investigator. And perhaps someday Arenosa Shelter will 
              finally be published and Dave Dibble's finest fieldwork will reach 
              proper conclusion.</p>
            <p class="text"> <b><a name="Prewitt"></a>Elton R. Prewitt</b> served 
              as one of Dibble's main field assistants at Bonfire. Born and raised 
              in deep East Texas, he left the family farm after high school and 
              headed to Austin in the fall of 1962 to study archeology at the 
              University of Texas. The following summer he got his first field 
              experience working for the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP, 
              forerunner of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory) at Proctor 
              Reservoir. When given the opportunity to participate in UT Austin's 
              ongoing archeological research program in the Lower Pecos, in advance 
              of the creation of Amistad Reservoir, he jumped at the chance </p>
            <p class="text">Bonfire Shelter holds a very special place in Prewitt's 
              heart. During the many months he worked at this spectacular but 
              challenging archeological site, he realized that archeology was 
              his chosen career. His &quot;taskmaster,&quot; Dave Dibble, became 
              his mentor and friend and he credits his on-the-job training under 
              Dibble as being critical in his professional development. After 
              the Bonfire project, Prewitt went on to work at a series of other 
              sites in the Lower Pecos and throughout the state.</p>
            <p class="text"> In 1979, after working for many years at the University 
              of Texas (where he obtained his B.A. and M.A. degrees), Prewitt 
              struck off on his own and, with wife Kerza, formed one of the first 
              private archeological consulting firms in the state. There was a 
              growing demand for archeological consultants because of requirements 
              of federal and state historic preservation laws such as the National 
              Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Today Prewitt and Associates, 
              Inc. is one of the most respected archeological firms in the south-central 
              United States. </p>
            <p class="text">His firm's success now allows Prewitt to spend more 
              time in the Lower Pecos following up on archeological projects he 
              has been waiting for decades to do. Each spring for the past five 
              years Elton has returned to Bonfire Shelter to lead tours organized 
              by Professor Grant Hall of Texas Tech University. Renown for his 
              storytelling abilities, several of Elton's stories of the 1963-1964 
              work at Bonfire are retold in these pages.</p>
           <p class="text"> <b><a name="Turpin"></a>Dr. Solveig Turpin</b> was 
              the lead investigator of the 1983-1984 investigations at Bonfire. 
              Turpin is well known for her work in the Lower Pecos, and she has 
              published numerous articles, reports, and books on the rock art 
              and archeology of the region. She received her formal training and 
              doctorate degree at the University of Texas at Austin and served 
              as Assistant Director of the Texas Archeological Survey (successor 
              of TASP, the contract archeology wing of TARL) under Dave Dibble. 
              When Dibble retired, Turpin became the Director of the Survey. In 
              the mid and late 1980s and continuing into the 1990s, she directed 
              a number of projects and mentored many young archeologists like 
              Lee Bement. During much of this time, she served as Associate Director 
              of TARL and headed Sponsored Projects, the successor of the Survey. 
          </p>
            <p class="text">Later Turpin formed the Borderlands Archeological 
              Research Unit at UT Austin and expanded her research into northeastern 
              Mexico. She is also one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.rockart.org/" target="_blank" class="text">Rock 
              Art Foundation</a>, an organization that seeks to preserve the rock 
              art of southwestern Texas for future generations. Today Turpin is 
              retired from the university, but continues to do contracted research 
              as a private consultant as well as her own research projects in 
              Mexico and southwestern Texas</p>
            <p class="text">Like Elton Prewitt, Turpin credits Dave Dibble for 
              her abiding interest in the Lower Pecos and adjacent areas of northern 
              Mexico. Her projects there are considered among the most prolific 
              and diverse. Turpin has conducted surveys, testing programs, major 
              excavations, collection documentations, and rock art investigations. 
              Throughout, she has consistently reported and published her work.</p>
            <p class="text"><b><a name="Bement"></a></b>Bonfire Shelter was the 
              scene of <b>Dr. Leland (Lee) Bement's</b> 1983 introduction to cave/rockshelter 
              archeology, faunal analysis, and Paleoindian archeology, interests 
              that he has followed ever since. At the time, Bement was a young 
              graduate student doing contract archeology at TARL under Solveig 
              Turpin, his chief mentor. Bement became so fascinated with Bonfire 
              and the mysteries of its earliest deposits that he took on the analysis 
              of the 1983-1984 field work for his Master's thesis. Later he worked 
              again with Turpin at several sinkholes in southwestern Texas, one 
              of which, the Bering Sinkhole near Kerrville, he studied for his 
              doctorial research. A thread that runs through much of Lee's career 
              is working with bones&#151;animal bones as well as human remains.<br>
              <br>
              After earning his doctorate at UT Austin, Bement moved to Oklahoma 
              to work with the Oklahoma Archeological Survey and teach archeology 
              at the University of Oklahoma at Norman. There he has led research 
              projects at several important Paleoindian sites, including the spectacular 
              find of a painted buffalo skull atop the jumbled bones at the Cooper 
              site, a Folsom bison kill site in northwestern Oklahoma. Today he 
              is considered an expert on Folsom archeology and continues to live 
              and work in Oklahoma. </p>
