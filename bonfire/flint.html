            <h2>The Investigations</h2>
			<h3>&quot;Flint, Don David, Flint!&quot; </h3>
            <p class="text">November 20, 1963 is a day etched forever in Elton 
              Prewitt's memory - that is the day they finally found the first 
              artifact in Bone Bed 2. The crew had been exposing the deeper bone 
              bed for weeks and looking in vain for some definitive evidence that 
              humans were responsible for what the archeologists suspected must 
              be a very old kill deposit. Then crew member Florencio Hinojosa 
              struck gold, or something much more valuable to the archeologists: 
              a flint artifact. </p>
            <p class="text">At the moment Dibble was down the canyon at Eagle 
              Cave visiting the excavations there. Back at Bonfire, the crew was 
              working in several different excavation units in the central and 
              southern parts of the shelter exposing more of Bone Bed 2 . &quot;El-tone, 
              El-tone! Fleent!&quot; cried out Florencio, sending Elton Prewitt 
              scrambling out of his unit and over to where Florencio was excitedly 
              gesturing. He pointed to the curving end of a finely-chipped projectile 
              point that he had just exposed beneath a bison rib bone. The crew 
              knew exactly what to do. Dibble had drilled into their heads the 
              standing order: &quot;If you find any flint artifact, stop immediately 
              and leave it exactly where it is.&quot; Elton helped Florencio gently 
              brush off the partially exposed artifact and pandemonium broke out. 
              Weeks of increasing tension and frustration were wiped away with 
              a single find.</p>
            <p class="text">Cosme Hinojosa, Florencio's younger brother, was sent 
              bounding down the canyon in search of Dibble. &quot;Fleent, Don 
              Da-veed, fleent!&quot; he hollered over and over. His cry reverberated 
              down the narrow canyon and reached Eagle Cave long before he did. 
              At first Dibble was alarmed to hear the yelling, afraid that something 
              bad had happened. But soon he made out Cosme's words: &quot;Flint, 
              Don David, flint, come quick.&quot; Dibble and the entire Eagle 
              Cave crew all took off immediately for Bonfire to see for themselves 
              what had been found. As Dibble's journal entry notes &quot;After 
              the discovery of this artifact - work at the site fell apart and 
              little constructive activity occurred from then on.&quot; </p>
            <p class="text">Dibble decided to leave the point in place and call 
              in witnesses. Ed Jelks was contacted by phone, and an Austin group 
              including Curtis Tunnell, a geologist, and several others came down 
              the next day to verify the find before it was removed. Emilio Hinojosa 
              (the oldest Hinojosa brother) and Roy Little volunteered to spend 
              the night at Bonfire, just to make sure no harm befell their discovery. 
              Elton remembers walking up to Bonfire early the next morning and 
              seeing Emilo sitting at the mouth of the shelter grinning and clutching 
              a rifle as he zealously guarded the Bonfire crew's prize. </p>
            <p class="text">Finding the first Plainview point in Bone Bed 2 was 
              a transforming moment in the Bonfire excavations. Uncertainty vanished, 
              they now knew they were dealing with a bonafide Paleoindian bison 
              kill deposit at least 11,000 years old.</p>
