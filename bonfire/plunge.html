    <td width="372"><p class="text">What archeologists and others call a bison &quot;jump&quot; 
              was, of course, not a jump at all. It was, at least from the buffalo's 
              perspective, a terrifying plunge of death. Exactly how Native American 
              hunters engineered the bison stampedes at Bonfire Shelter will never 
              be known. Based on historical accounts of similar bison kills in 
              the northern Great Plains, the Bonfire stampedes were probably carefully 
              orchestrated events that depended on luck and skill in equal measure.</p>
			  <p class="text">Bison are creatures of the grasslands that behave like wild 
              cattle, their distant relatives. Gregarious by nature, bison stick 
              together for protection from wolves and other predators like humans, 
              forming herds that sometimes number in the thousands and stretch 
              for miles. Bison herds typically move slowly as the heavy animals 
              lumber along, grazing on grass as they go much like modern cattle. 
              But when threatened or frightened, a bison herd can stampede, forming 
              a thundering mass of panicking animals that moves as a single body. 
              Once a stampede has begun, the herd sometimes travels for miles 
              before exhaustion sets in or until the lead animals no longer perceive 
              danger and gradually bring the herd to a halt. </p>
           <p class="text">The Indians who lived in buffalo country 
              knew well the behavioral characteristics of their favorite prey. 
              Many different hunting strategies were devised including stalking, 
              surrounds, box canyon traps, and deep-snow quagmires. In the case 
              of bison jumps, such as those evidenced at Bonfire Shelter, conditions 
              had to be just right to take advantage of the bison's tendency to 
              stampede.</p>
            <p class="text">The terrain around Bonfire Shelter is very rugged 
              and deeply incised by canyons. Therefore, a bison jump could only 
              be staged when bison were in the immediate area, probably in the 
              flat uplands northeast of the site. Once a herd was spotted in the 
              area, the hunters would have had to carefully follow a plan that 
              depended on surprise and trickery. Bonfire Shelter must have been 
              recognized as having the right combination of flat or rolling terrain 
              ending in a steep and abrupt cliff. In fact, the cliff edge above 
              Bonfire is not visible due to the sloping terrain until just before 
              one reaches the edge. Even more important is the presence of a narrow, 
              steep-sided erosional gully or &quot;cleft&quot; that runs perpendicular 
              to the cliff face directly above Bonfire Shelter. This natural feature 
              would have blocked a possible escape route and essentially funneled 
              the bison off the cliff.</p>
            <p class="text">Having chosen this ideal spot, the hunters had to 
              wait until a herd wandered into a narrow target zone in the rolling 
              terrain upstream and uphill from the cliff above Bonfire Shelter. 
              There, one group of hunters had to trigger a stampede, perhaps by 
              using fire. For the scheme to work, the stampeding bison had to 
              be heading in the general direction of the shelter. But how did 
              they keep the herd from veering off the intended course? Historical 
              accounts suggest that additional hunters (including their family 
              members, women and children alike) would have erected brush or rock 
              barricades, used fires, or waved blankets to divert the bison away 
              from alternative routes and toward the cliff edge. The sudden appearance 
              of people springing up from nowhere presumably gave the bison additional 
              reason to panic. </p>
            <p class="text">If everything worked just right, the stampeding herd 
              would follow the desired path and gallop over the rise and suddenly 
              encounter the cliff. By then it was too late. The only possible 
              escape route&#151;along the cliff&#151;was cut off by the steep-sided 
              cleft. Bison can run as fast as 30-35 miles-per-hour. Even if the 
              galloping heavy animals could have stopped in time, the momentum 
              of the herd, most of whom followed the lead animals blindly, would 
              have (and obviously did) propel many bison over the edge.</p>
            <p class="text">The plunge of death must have been a horrific sight 
              to behold. In the space of a minute or less, dozens, or in some 
              cases hundreds, of bison plummeted down the cliff. They fell about 
              75 feet and landed on the cone-shaped pile of rocks that occurs 
              directly beneath the notch. Some of the animals rolled into the 
              cave, others must have fallen down the outside of the talus cone 
              down into the canyon floor. But most fell on top of one another. 
              An adult male modern bison can weigh as much as a ton (2,240 pounds) 
              and stands six feet high. The extinct bison species found at Bonfire 
              Shelter was much larger, an adult male may have weighed 3,500 pounds 
              and stood 7 1/2 feet high. </p>
            <p class="text">Typically, bison herds are led by the bigger bulls 
              (males) in their prime, with younger bulls, cows (females) and calves 
              following behind. This social structure may not have held up during 
              a stampede, when the normal order of things broke down. But if big 
              bulls were at the forefront of the Bonfire stampedes they would 
              have had an additional factor working against them when they suddenly 
              encountered the cliff edge and tried to stop. Male bison have most 
              of their weight centered over their front legs, an arrangement which 
              is useful when they lower their heads and charge other bulls during 
              battles to establish pecking order and mating rights, but not so 
              advantageous when trying to stop quickly from a dead run.<br>
              <br>
              The fall alone must have killed many of the bison, but with so many, 
              some must have survived the fall, crippled perhaps, but attempting 
              to rise and bellowing in pain and terror. Hours may have passed 
              before the last bison were dispatched as the successful hunters 
              began the long process of butchering the bison, cutting up strips 
              of meat to be dried, and picking the best hides for skinning.</p>
            <p class="text">One last thought on the plunge of death. The Native 
              Americans who used the buffalo jump technique at Bonfire Shelter 
              sometimes met with success on a far greater scale than they intended 
              or needed. In Bone Bed 3 in particular, there is abundant evidence 
              that far more animals were killed than could be used. In fact, the 
              original analyst argued that Bone Bed 3 could represent a single 
              event in which as many as 800 animals died. Others think it more 
              likely that it represents several events, but even so these were 
              massive kills. Partially or entirely articulated (fitted together) 
              skeletons where found in the lower portions of Bone Bed 3. In other 
              cases archeologists recognized that only the most desirable parts 
              of the animals&#151;especially the hindquarters&#151;showed signs 
              of butchering. In other words, a great deal of the bison meat and 
              hides in the larger jump episodes went to waste. </p>
            <p class="text">The caricature  of the noble savage, the idea that all pre-Columbian native peoples 
              lived in perfect harmony with nature, just doesn't jibe with the 
              evidence at Bonfire Shelter. Prehistoric bison hunters were sometimes  wasteful and killed far  more animals than they needed or  used. But lest we get carried 
              away with this point, successful bison jumps were probably rare, 
              once-in-a-lifetime events. For at least 13,000 years after people 
              arrived on the continent, bison continued to thrive on the Great 
              Plains. The fact is that the immense bison herds of the Great Plains 
              were almost completely decimated by the late 1800s because of indiscriminate 
              hide hunters, most of whom were Anglos, who used rifles to kill 
              thousands and thousands of bison for nothing more than their hides. 
              Fortunately, the bison was saved from the brink of extinction and 
              is today thriving once again on large ranches on the Great Plains, 
              some owned and operated by Native Americans. </p>
