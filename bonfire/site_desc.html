              radiocarbon dates. This kind of technical detail matters a great 
              deal to archeologists and anyone who really wants to understand 
              how and when the site's deposits formed. If you don't have the time 
              or interest for the details, you might want to read the first part 
              and take a look at some of the photographs and the map or just <a href="explore.html" class="text">Explore 
              Bonfire</a>. </p>
            <h3><a name="physical"></a>Physical Description</h3>
            <p class="text">Bonfire Shelter is crescent-shaped when viewed from 
              above (&quot;plan view&quot;) with a wide &quot;mouth&quot; (opening) 
              almost 300 feet (about 90 meters) across. Most of the shelter's 
              mouth is blocked from view by a series of giant roof blocks, huge 
              chunks of limestone that were once part of the shelter's roof. Behind 
              the fallen roof blocks, the floor of the shelter slopes toward the 
              back or rear of the shelter, an unusual configuration. The floor 
              of the shelter varies from less than 80 feet wide to more than 200 
              feet in the middle of the shelter. Apart from the roof blocks, the 
              most prominent topographic feature in Bonfire Shelter is the cone-shaped 
              debris pile (&quot;talus cone&quot;) directly beneath the notch 
              in the cliff. Many of the buffalo in Bone Bed 3 landed atop the 
              talus cone and tumbled into the cave. Because of the roof blocks 
              and the talus cone as well the brush and small trees growing around 
              these features, Bonfire Shelter is all but invisible from the canyon 
              floor below.</p>
            <p class="text">To get an idea of what the place looked like before 
              the archeological work began, look at the site map and try to ignore 
              the shaded excavation units and look closely at the contour or topographic 
              lines which are drawn at 1-foot intervals. The contour lines are 
              shown only for the parts of the shelter that had buried deposits; 
              the stippled roof blocks at the front of the shelter jut up from 
              the &quot;floor&quot; as can be seen in the photographs. The most 
              dramatic topographic feature shown by the contour lines is the talus 
              cone situated directly under the cleft in the cliff above the shelter. 
              Follow the contour lines down from the high point and you will see 
              that the lowest part of the original surface of Bonfire Shelter 
              is actually at the back of the shelter, rather than at the front 
              as is often the case with most rockshelters. Long, long ago the 
              floor of Bonfire Shelter did indeed slope downward from back to 
              front in the typical fashion. But the collapse of part of the roof 
              sometime prior to 14,100 years ago left behind the giant roof blocks 
              which, in effect, created a dam that held in sediment and small 
              roof spalls that otherwise would have tumbled into the canyon. </p>
            <p class="text">The careful profiles or <a href="map.html" class="text" target="_blank">cross-section 
              drawings</a> made during the 1963-1964 excavations show how Bonfire 
              Shelter's deposits vary in thickness and extent. </p>
			 <h3><a name="deposits"></a>The Deposits</h3>
            <p class="text">The natural and cultural deposits within Bonfire Shelter 
              are complex and are thought to reach a maximum depth of at least 
              22 feet (7 meters) below the modern floor of the shelter. Archeological 
              excavations have only penetrated through the upper 13 feet (4 meters) 
              of the shelter's deposits, but landowner Jack Skiles drove an iron 
              rebar down nearly 10 feet (3 meters) before encountering impenetrable 
              rock. It is not known whether he reached bedrock or a large boulder. 
              In any case, the deepest known deposits consist of stream-rolled 
              gravels, suggesting that the shelter was periodically flooded prior 
              to the formation of the site's earliest known bone beds. At the 
              level in which the first bone bed began accumulating (at least 14,100 
              years ago and probably considerably earlier) there is no evidence 
              of major flood episodes in the shelter deposits, suggesting that 
              the canyon floor had been cut down (by erosion through bedrock) 
              well below the shelter. All of the deposits containing animal bone 
              and all those containing definitive evidence of human occupation 
              seem to have been formed by a combination of natural and cultural 
              processes. </p>
            <p class="text">Most of the deposits in Bonfire Shelter consist of 
              limestone spalls (rocks that peeled or &quot;spalled&quot; off the 
              shelter roof and rear wall) and pale-colored silt that represents 
              decomposed limestone bedrock. The massive rocks piled along the 
              front of the shelter represent a major collapse of the original 
              roof of the shelter. This potentially catastrophic event (probably 
              several events) occurred well before humans began using the shelter. 
              We know this because none of the cultural zones appear to continue 
              under the rock fall, but instead butt up against the rocks. The 
              fallen rocks formed a natural barrier or wall that closed in the 
              mouth of the shelter. Because of this feature, Bonfire Shelter is 
              practically invisible from the canyon floor. The fallen rocks also 
              help prevent sunlight from striking most of the shelter, making 
              Bonfire relatively cool, especially in the winter. </p>
            <p class="text">Other than the huge rocks at the mouth of the shelter, 
              the most prominent topographic feature in the site is the cone-shaped 
              debris pile directly beneath the cleft or notch in the cliff. This 
              pile of rocks and sediment is called a &quot;talus cone,&quot; and 
              it accumulated periodically when locally heavy rains caused lots 
              of water to drain off the cliff through the notch, leaving behind 
              a layer of dirt and rocks. The rocks and debris deposited by the 
              runoff formed the talus cone (the rock pile and the steeply sloping 
              deposits around it). The talus cone also helped block sunlight into 
              the shelter and served as a dam that prevented water from draining 
              out of the shelter. This helps explain why Bonfire Shelter is relatively 
              wet compared to most other large rockshelters. </p>
            <p class="text">The excavation profiles from the 1963-1964 investigations 
              show how Bonfire Shelter's layers relate to one another in different 
              areas of the shelter. Start with the <a href="map.html" class="text" target="_blank">plan 
              map</a> showing the location of the excavation units within the 
              rockshelter. By comparing various profiles you will see that the 
              site's deposits were deeper in some areas of the shelter than others 
              and that the layers sloped steeply in some areas, while they were 
              more or less flat in others. The site's major stratigraphic layers 
              are briefly described below, from bottom to top, using the scheme 
              devised by Dave Dibble. </p>
            <p class="text"><b>Zone 1</b> is the thick, lower portion of the shelter's 
              deposits below Bone Bed 2 within which various smaller strata (lenses) 
              occur. The two closely spaced layers of bone that Dibble collectively 
              called <b>Bone Bed 1</b> lies within his Zone 1. Based on more-extensive 
              exposure with better lighting, the 1983-1984 excavators divided 
              this lower zone into at least six strata (only the first five of 
              which were labeled). To avoid confusion with the original numbering 
              system, they assigned letters to the strata they encountered beginning 
              with the uppermost layer of Bone Bed 2 (Stratum A) and continuing 
              to Stratum I, the lowest bone-bearing layer. But still deeper was 
              a thick deposit containing boulders and fine stream-rolled gravels 
              that was not designated as a stratum and the bottom of which was 
              not encountered. Unfortunately, the revised stratigraphy of Zone 
              1 has yet to be fully published.</p>
            <p class="text">Based on the 1983-1984 work, five bone-bearing strata 
              were defined below Bone Bed 2, within and below Zone 1 as encountered 
              and described by Dibble. These include Strata D, E (arbitrarily 
              divided into E, F and G), H-1, H-2, and I. There is no conclusive 
              evidence that humans were present at Bonfire Shelter during the 
              accumulation of Zone 1, although several lines of evidence led both 
              groups of investigators to hypothesize that humans played a part 
              in the accumulation of bones in several of the layers within the 
              original Bone Bed 1. </p>
            <p class="text"><b>Bone Bed 2</b> is the major Paleoindian-era bone 
              layer composed almost entirely of the bones of an extinct form of 
              bison mixed with cave dust. In some places it consisted of three 
              lenses of bone, but in others only a single layer was apparent. 
              Because of the three lenses (labeled Strata A-C by the 1983-1984 
              excavators), it is inferred that at least three bison jumps contributed 
              to Bone Bed 2. Because of the lack of an intervening layer of silt 
              or roof spall, it is thought that comparatively little time elapsed 
              between Paleoindian jump events. Still, sediment generally accumulated 
              slowly in the shelter and several hundred years or more could have 
              elapsed without noticeable sediment accumulation. </p>
            <p class="text"><b>Zone 2</b> is a thick, relatively homogenous layer 
              consisting mainly of natural silt and roof spalls. Within Zone 2, 
              the original excavators recognized what they termed the &quot;<b>Intermediate 
              Horizon</b>&quot; consisting of two fire hearths, a few stone tools, 
              and a possible living surface. The later investigators found several 
              other hearths that did not appear to be directly related to those 
              reported by Dibble. Collectively, the Intermediate Horizon appears 
              to represent a series of minor occupational events that occurred 
              sporadically during the roughly 8,500 years between Bone Beds 2 
              and 3.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Bone Bed 3</b> is the massive bone bed dating to 
              the Late Archaic that was burned so intensively that many of the 
              bones were reduced to ash. There is some question as to whether 
              Bone Bed 3 represents a single, massive bison jump episode or several 
              successive episodes. There is no compelling stratigraphic evidence 
              of the latter possibility, but Dibble and several other archeologists 
              familiar with the site thought it unlikely that such a massive deposit 
              of bone could result from a single event.</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Zone 3</b> is another thick and relatively homogenous 
              layer consisting mainly of natural silt and roof spalls. Within 
              Zone 3, a thin, intermittent layer of perishable material known 
              as the <b>Fiber Layer</b> was documented at the southern end of 
              the shelter. </p>

            <p class="text">This schematic diagram profile shows the approximate 
              stratigraphic relationship among certain of the site's major depositional 
              zones and seven of the site's radiocarbon assays. The twelve radiocarbon

              a calibrated age of 13,032-12,414 B.C. (range of 3 midpoints). This 
              date falls a thousand years or more earlier than the oldest accepted 
              age of Clovis culture (about 11,500 B.C.). </p>
            <p class="text">Bone Bed 2 produced four radiocarbon assays on charcoal, 
              three from Hearth 1 and one from scattered charcoal, but all from 
              the uppermost part of the deposit providing a minimum age estimate. 
              The calibrated midpoint ages of these four assays range between 
              9308-10,146 B.C., but assays overlap at the 1-sigma (66.6% probability) 
              level between 9,680-9,692 B.C., suggesting a minimum age of at least 
              11,680 years old. The finding of a Folsom point in the lower part 
              of Bone Bed 2 suggests that the earliest Paleoindian bison jumps 
              could date several hundred years earlier. </p>
            <p class="text">There are three assays on charcoal from three hearths 
              exposed in the Intermediate Horizon yielding the following calibrated 
              mid-point ages: 6156-6076 B.C., 5316 B.C., and 2888 B.C. None of 
              the assays overlap at the 2-sigma level, suggesting that they represent 
              events widely separated in time during the Early and Middle Archaic 
              or the Viejo and Eagle Nest periods defined by Dibble. It is reassuring 
              to note that the dates fall in correct stratigraphic order, youngest 
              to oldest being also highest to lowest.</p>
            <p class="text">Bone Bed 3 is dated by two assays on charcoal, with 
              calibrated midpoint ages of 917 B.C. and 762-602 B.C. (five midpoints). 
              Although the 2-sigma date ranges overlap between 833-788 B.C., the 
              overlap lies at the ends of the probability curves, meaning that 
              there is only a relatively small probability that the two assays 
              are dating the same event. Said differently, the two radiocarbon 
              assays could be interpreted as support for the notion that Bone 
              Bed 3 is the result of at least two events separated by several 
              hundred years. Both fall within the Late Archaic or the Cibola period 
              as defined by Dibble.</p>
            <p class="text">Two charcoal dates from the Fiber Layer yielded calibrated 
              midpoints of A.D. 362-383 (three midpoints) and A.D. 652. The 2-sigma 
              calibrated ranges overlap between A.D. 406-541, but as with the 
              Bone Bed 3 assays, the overlap falls at the ends of the probability 
              curves and the assays could well represent two different occupational 
              events. These age estimates fall at the end of the Late Archaic 
              or within the Blue Hills period defined by Dibble. </p>
