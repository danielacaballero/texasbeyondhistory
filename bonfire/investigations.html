              Bones </h3>
            <p class="text">The first hint of the archeological potential of Bonfire 
              Shelter came to light in 1958 due to the curiosity of a high school 
              student from Midland, Texas, who had accompanied his parents on 
              a social visit to landowners Guy and Vashti Skiles. Having time 
              on his hands, the high school student grabbed a shovel and a bucket 
              and climbed down into Mile Canyon, intent on discovery. He headed 
              to a place Guy Skiles had shown him, a large rockshelter with a 
              partially fallen roof that was sometimes called &quot;Ice Box Cave&quot; 
              because of its tendency to stay much cooler than elsewhere in the 
              canyon. The mouth of the shelter faced northwest, and massive limestone 
              blocks that had fallen from the roof of the shelter sometime in 
              the distant past blocked even the rays of the late afternoon sun 
              from reaching the floor of the shelter. </p>
            <p class="text">Guy Skiles, who had explored many of the shelters 
              and caves in the area, had poked around in Ice Box Cave a few times 
              but never found much of interest. All that could be seen on the 
              surface of the cave was dust, goat droppings, broken animal bones, 
              and the scattered remains of a campfire left by goat herders or 
              smugglers earlier in the century. The main path into the cave entered 
              from the south along the cliff and, at the mouth of the cave, visitors 
              could see broken animal bones eroding from the talus slope. These, 
              everybody assumed, must be goat or cattle bones. </p>
            <p class="text">Mile Canyon had been explored by a team of amateur 
              archeologists from San Antonio's Witte Museum in 1936. Near the 
              upper end of the canyon they noted the presence of a large rockshelter 
              with a fallen roof and a few holes from earlier relic-hunters, but 
              did not notice any archeological evidence. This is the first reported 
              mention of the place that later came to be known as Bonfire Shelter. 
              The Witte Museum team did not linger because its mission was to 
              find interesting, perishable artifacts for public display. They 
              headed to an enormous rockshelter called <a href="images/Eagle-Cave-from-Canyon.html" target="_blank" class="text">Eagle 
              Cave</a>, a short distance away from Bonfire Shelter on the opposite 
              bank of the canyon. Eagle Cave was littered with artifacts including 
              many pieces of plant fiber, wood, bone, and even basket fragments, 
              fragile things that are preserved only in the dry confines of the 
              shelter. The Witte crew spent several weeks digging a large trench 
              through the center of the cave and brought back hundreds of artifacts 
              to San Antonio. On display there, the objects fascinated the public 
              and, unfortunately, whetted the appetite of artifact collectors. 
              Soon virtually every large cave and rockshelter in the Lower Pecos 
              had been dug into by relic-hunters, so much so that relatively few 
              undisturbed deposits remained unplundered.</p>
            <p class="text">Ice Box Cave had remained almost untouched in 1958 
              simply because &quot;bigger and better&quot; was near at hand and, 
              by comparison, the place didn't look very promising. To the high 
              school student from Midland, however, the fallen roof of the cave 
              begged the question: When did the roof collapse? Were Indians living 
              in the cave before then? So he climbed up to Ice Box Cave and began 
              digging a small hole. The student and several of his pals had been 
              roaming the country around Midland for several years picking up 
              arrowheads which could often be found on the wind-scoured surface 
              in dry west Texas during the drought of the 1950s. Like many people 
              who spend time outdoors, the student became fascinated with these 
              objects, most of which, he knew, represented the tips of darts or 
              throwing spears that Native Americans had hurled with the atlatl 
              or spear-thrower. Guy Skiles had even found fragments of wooden 
              atlatls and dart shafts in the dry caves near Langtry, and this 
              spurred on the student. </p>
            <p class="text">Arriving at the cave, he picked a spot near its mouth 
              at the top of the steep slope where he could see a few bone fragments 
              eroding out as he climbed up into the cave. As he began digging, 
              the high school student tried to emulate the square holes he had 
              seen archeologists dig. He had already joined the Texas Archeological 
              Society and had been reading books about archeology, especially 
              those about Early Man. Less than a foot beneath the surface he hit 
              bone&#151;lots of bone, and all of it was heavily charred. Many 
              of the brittle pieces he dug up crumbled into ashes as he tried 
              to pick them up. He continued to dig, not sure what to make of all 
              this burned bone. The bone layer wasn't very thick and beneath it 
              he hit a layer of cave dust and rock, similar to the first one he 
              had encountered. </p>
            <p class="text">After digging a while and not finding any artifacts, 
              the high school student gave up and sat back on the edge of his 
              sort-of-square hole, staring at the layer of burned bones. He wondered 
              what kind of bones he had found and who had set them on fire. Most 
              of the bones looked big and resembled cow bones, but he couldn't 
              imagine why a rancher would destroy so many valuable cattle in such 
              a remote place. He also knew that Guy Skiles mainly raised goats 
              because the land was just too dry for cattle. Maybe, he thought, 
              these were buffalo bones. But why were they burned and why were 
              there so many of them? He brushed the walls of his hole and searched 
              intently for some positive sign, such as an arrowhead, that the 
              bones he had found had been left by Indians. No luck, but he did 
              find a large jawbone with big teeth in it and decided to take it 
              back with him. He was well acquainted with a geologist with the 
              Louisiana Land and Exploration Company back in Midland who knew 
              a lot about animal bones, Indians, too, for that matter. With that 
              in mind, he proudly carried the jawbone back to show his parents 
              and hosts what he had found.</p>
            <p class="text">To jump ahead of the story, the high school student 
              became so interested in Indian artifacts and the lives of the people 
              that had created them that he decided to major in archeology/anthropology 
              at the University of Texas at Austin in the early 1960s. A few years 
              later, between M.A. graduate work at UT and Ph.D. studies at the 
              University of Arizona, he returned to the Lower Pecos and conducted 
              archeological test excavations at many sites in the area as part 
              of the team from the University of Texas. His dissertation research 
              focused on the stone tools from Arenosa Shelter, another large rockshelter 
              further down the Rio Grande from Langtry. Today, Dr. Michael B. 
              Collins is a well-known expert in Paleoindian archeology and geoarcheology, 
              the use of geological techniques and knowledge to address archeological 
              problems. He is a former Associate Director and current Research 
              Associate at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. He is 
              currently leading a major expedition to the Gault site north of 
              Austin. But back to 1958.</p>
            <p class="text">Young Mike Collins took the jawbone back to Midland 
              and showed it to his friend, Glen Evans, who did indeed know a great 
              deal about animal bones and Indian remains. Evans had trained in 
              paleontology, the study of fossil bones, and worked for many years 
              for the Texas Memorial Museum before turning to the oil business. 
              While working for the museum in the late 1940s and early 1950s, 
              he participated in many paleontological and archeological digs including 
              those at several famous Paleoindian sites such as Blackwater Draw 
              near Clovis, New Mexico, and the <a href="../lubbock/index.html" class="text">Lubbock 
              Lake site</a>. When Collins showed Evans the jawbone, the geologist 
              recognized it as the mandible of the American buffalo, <em>Bison 
              bison</em>. He also guessed that the burning must have had something 
              to do with the prehistoric hunters who he assumed must be responsible 
              for the buffalo bones winding up in Ice Box Cave.</p>
            <p class="text">This news excited the landowners and their grown son, 
              Jack Skiles, who was then a high school science teacher in west 
              Texas. A few years later, Jack was able to attend UT Austin for 
              one year to broaden his knowledge of science under a special National 
              Science Foundation program. There he learned that a team of archeologists 
              from the University of Texas was conducting research along the Rio 
              Grande in advance of the building of Amistad Dam. Jack knew that 
              more could be learned from a scientific approach than the rather 
              haphazard digging his father did. Therefore, on behalf of his family, 
              Jack contacted the University of Texas and invited the archeologists 
              working at Amistad to come look at Ice Box Cave. </p>
            <h3 ><a name="enter"></a>Enter the Archeologists </h3>
            <p class="text">In the early 1960s, the Texas Archeological Salvage 
              Project (TASP, forerunner of TARL) at the University of Texas was 
              under contract with the National Park Service to carry out archeological 
              and environmental research in the area that was to be flooded by 
              what was then called Diablo Reservoir (later, Amistad). The lake 
              would be created by the construction of a huge dam across the Rio 
              Grande just upstream from the twin cities of Del Rio, Texas, and 
              Ciudad Acuna, Mexico. Dr. Edward B. Jelks, TASP Director, administered 
              the project from his office in Austin. The field investigations 
              were headed by Curtis Tunnell, then Curator of Anthropology at the 
              Texas Memorial Museum at the University of Texas. (Incidentally, 
              at the time, there was no need to add &quot;at Austin&quot; to the 
              University of Texas; there was only one.) In the fall of 1962 when 
              Tunnell learned of the cave with burned bones in it, he sent Mark 
              Parsons, a young archeologist working for TASP, to investigate. 
              Parsons was in charge of a small survey team that was revisiting 
              known sites and recording new sites in advance of major excavations.</p>
            <p class="text">Parsons found the shallow hole dug by Collins four 
              or five years earlier and set up a small test pit nearby to try 
              and determine if the layer of burned bones was prehistoric in age. 
              Local rumor had it that the burned bones discovered in Ice Box Cave 
              were the remains of cattle someone had tried to smuggle in from 
              Mexico and that agents of the U.S. Animal Control Service had confiscated. 
              In the late 1940s and early 1950s, there was great concern over 
              the spread of hoof and mouth disease from Mexico into the U.S. Mexican 
              cattle were not allowed across the border except under special permit. 
              And so the story was that a smuggler, some said it was Guy Skiles 
              himself, had been caught trying to take Mexican cattle into Texas 
              and that the Animal Control agents destroyed the illegal animals 
              by torching them in Ice Box Cave. An unlikely story at best and 
              one that the Skiles family obviously knew was false, but the rumors 
              added to the uncertainty. What were so many burned animal bones 
              doing in such a remote place?</p>
            <p class="text">While exploring Ice Box Cave, Mark Parsons went about 
              formally recording the rockshelter and registering its official 
              designation, 41VV218. (It was the 218th archeological site to be 
              recorded in Val Verde County; the &quot;41&quot; stands for Texas. 
              The naming system, designed by the Smithsonian, is less than prosaic 
              perhaps, but the three-part code makes record keeping much easier.) 
              Within a few hours Parsons had found several stone tools in the 
              test pit including a burned Montell dart point that seemed to be 
              associated with the burned bone layer. The Montell dart point style 
              has a highly distinctive shape and is known to date to the Late 
              Archaic period about 2,500-3,000 years ago. This was the evidence 
              he had been sent to find: apparent confirmation that the bones were 
              prehistoric in age and almost certainly bison (it is very hard to 
              positively distinguish bison and cow, even for experts like Glen 
              Evans). Parsons finished taking field notes about the rockshelter 
              and his small test pit and took off. Tomorrow would be another day 
              and another site to investigate. </p>
            <p class="text">You might be wondering about the difference between 
              a cave and a rockshelter and why both terms have been applied to 
              the same places. Technically, a rockshelter (shelter for short) 
              is wider than it is deep and a cave is deeper than it is wide. But 
              many folks call any dark hole in the side of a cliff a cave. Archeologists, 
              who as a group are notorious for their ability to spend hours, sometimes 
              days, &quot;splitting hairs&quot; and making ever-finer distinctions, 
              prefer to use the terms correctly. Nonetheless, Eagle Cave is still 
              called a cave even though technically it is wider than it is deep&#151;the 
              name is too ingrained in the local lore. Ice Box Cave, on the other 
              hand, was one of several local names for the locality known today 
              as Bonfire Shelter. </p>
           <h3 ><a name="1963"></a>The 1963-1964 Excavations</h3>
            <p class="text">At the time, the finding of a thick layer of burned 
              animal bone in apparent association with a Late Archaic dart point 
              was unique in the Lower Pecos. The region was known for its rock 
              art and for the preservation of ordinarily perishable materials, 
              especially fiber and wood, in the dry caves and shelters. Animal 
              bones were common in the cave deposits but the largest animals were 
              usually deer or antelope. Bison bones were rare, and it was assumed 
              that the area had been too dry to support grasslands since the end 
              of the last Ice Age. A thick layer of burned bison bone was unheard 
              of. So Jelks and Tunnell began to plan a major excavation at what 
              they began calling &quot;Bone Cave&quot; or &quot;Burned Bone Cave.&quot; 
              (Yes, Ice Box Cave, Bonfire Shelter, Bone Cave, Burned Bone Cave, 
              and 41VV218 are all one and the same place.)</p>
            <p class="text"><a href="archeologists.html#Dibble" class="text">David 
              (Dave) S. Dibble</a>, the archeologist chosen to run the excavation 
              at Bone Cave, was new to Texas, having been born and raised in Utah. 
              Dibble had worked on several massive archeological salvage projects 
              in the west under the legendary archeologist, Jessie Jennings. Jennings 
              was famous for his work at Danger Cave, a deeply stratified cave 
              that yielded an almost unbroken occupational sequence dating back 
              to Paleoindian times. Dibble had studied under Jennings at the University 
              of Utah and helped with the analysis of Danger Cave. When he got 
              a call from Jelks, Dibble agreed to come down to Texas and take 
              a look.</p>
            <p class="text">Dave Dibble arrived in Austin in late August of 1963. 
              As he stepped off the bus, the unfamiliar Gulf Coastal humidity 
              caused him to seriously entertain the notion of hopping on the next 
              bus back home to high and dry Utah. But the lure of an interesting 
              archeological challenge proved irresistible: a mysterious layer 
              of charred buffalo bones in a remote cave and the opportunity to 
              work in a new region. The archeology of the Lower Pecos was still 
              very poorly known at the time, and the Amistad Reservoir work was 
              planned to continue for several more years. The climate of Texas, 
              he was told, was often delightful in the fall, winter, and spring.</p>
            <h3>UT Teams Arrive in Comstock</h3>
            <p class="text">A month later, two archeological teams from the University 
              of Texas arrived in Comstock, Texas, a small ranching town between 
              Del Rio and Langtry. Comstock was the closest place they could find 
              to Bone and Eagle Caves where housing and a work force could be 
              found (Langtry was almost a ghost town). Two young archeologists-in-the-making, 
              <a href="archeologists.html#Prewitt" class="text">Elton Prewitt</a> 
              and Roy Little, were to be Dibble's assistants. Mark Parsons and 
              Richard (Dick) Ross were there to conduct new excavations at Eagle 
              Cave. Curtis Tunnell was along to make sure both excavations got 
              off to a proper start. Housing had to be arranged, local workers 
              hired on for both crews, and so on. </p>
            <p class="text">On September 27th, preliminary work began at both 
              sites. This meant lugging the digging equipment down into the steep 
              canyon and up to the shelters, setting up screening areas, establishing 
              datums (reference points), and laying out excavation grids. Curtis 
              Tunnell took on the task of mapping both shelters. Elton Prewitt 
              remembers that he and Roy Little spent a day working with Tunnell 
              at Eagle Cave, learning how to map a site with a plane table and 
              alidade. Each young archeologist spent half a day holding the rod 
              and half a day learning to use an alidade, a somewhat awkward surveying 
              instrument that was then the standard archeological mapping tool. 
              (Today most archeologists use computerized mapping tools which seem 
              easier and faster but do not necessarily produce better maps.)</p>
            <p class="text">At the outset of the excavations at Bone Cave (Bonfire 
              Shelter), the main objective was to investigate the burned bone 
              layer and confirm that it was definitely associated with Late Archaic 
              artifacts. The biggest question, according to the Daily Journal 
              that Dave Dibble carefully kept, concerned the conflagration that 
              had created such a thick layer of burned bones. Was this a natural 
              fire or an intentional pyre? And why here? How did all those buffalo 
              bones come to be in Bone Cave? Was this a jump site?</p>
            <p class="text">To begin answering these questions, several 10-x-10-ft 
              squares were laid out and excavations got underway. It was soon 
              evident that the burned-bone layer or bed was extensive and that 
              it definitely was associated with Late Archaic dart points and other 
              artifacts. The quantity of the bone was such that a mass kill, probably 
              a &quot;jump,&quot; (see <a href="plunge.html" class="text">Plunge 
              of Death</a>) was the only viable explanation for how so many buffalo 
              wound up in an isolated rockshelter. Studying the topography, Dibble 
              saw that the cliff above the shelter could have served well as a 
              jump and that the buffalo must have fallen atop the rocks (fallen 
              roof blocks) piled at the mouth of the shelter. As the excavation 
              units progressed, a second bone bed was found about three feet below 
              the surface. The newly discovered bone bed also consisted of bison 
              bones, but many of these weren't burned and they seemed to be noticeably 
              larger in size. Was this bone layer evidence of a much earlier jump? 
              Were these the bones of an extinct bison species? </p>
            <p class="text">By the end of October, substantial portions of the 
              upper part of the deep bone bed were exposed in several different 
              excavation units, and still there was no definite evidence that 
              humans were involved. Dibble's journal entry for October 30 reads, 
              &quot;Today I began to get very discouraged regarding the chances 
              of finding human traces in the deep bone beds ... the evidence seems 
              most suggestive in F7, but still we fail to find anything definite.&quot; 
              It was unclear at the time whether they had found one deep bone 
              bed or several because not all the excavation units were connected. 
              Following standard archeological practice, Dibble assigned a separate 
              feature number (e.g., F7) to each exposure. But the work continued 
              and more and more of the deep bone bed was exposed. </p>
            <p class="text">Finally, on November 20, a finely flaked lanceolate 
              projectile point&#151;a Plainview point&#151;was found directly 
              beneath a bison rib, convincing evidence at last that Paleoindian 
              hunters were responsible for at least one bison jump. Dibble's daily 
              journal entry begins &quot;This was 'D' Day at VV218.&quot; It was 
              a <a href="flint.html" class="text">Day that Elton Prewitt Will 
              Never Forget</a> (click for story).</p>
            <p class="text"><a name="back"></a>This crucial find turned the corner, 
              and the archeologists now realized they were uncovering an extremely 
              important archeological deposit. Soon, fragments of additional Paleoindian 
              points were found amid the bones of the deep layer. Dibble also 
              began to notice minor differences in the encasing sediments and 
              the amount of roof spalls amid the bones, indications that Bone 
              Bed 2 had formed as the result of different jump episodes&#151;perhaps 
              as many as three. But this understanding did not come until later.</p>
            <h3>The Winter Work: 1963-1964</h3>
            <p class="text">Although the work plan had called for the completion 
              of the Bone Cave (Bonfire) excavations by Christmas, Jelks found 
              the money within the overall Amistad project budget for a two-month 
              extension. In early January, 1964, excavations resumed. </p>
            <p class="text">Big, important archeological projects have a way of 
              shaping the careers of archeologists and this was the case for Dibble 
              and many others who have worked at Bonfire Shelter. Dave Dibble 
              was a quiet person who took his responsibilities at Bonfire very 
              seriously. His journal entries reflect a thoughtful, systematic 
              approach. He carefully distinguished between what he had good evidence 
              for and what he only suspected might be true, as if reading his 
              notes later would remind him of doubts and lead him to better interpretations. 
              Crew member Elton Prewitt took advantage of Dibble's good nature 
              by periodically posting new names for the site on cardboard signs 
              at the entrance to the shelter such as &quot;Dibble's Deep Freeze.&quot; 
              &quot;Dibble's Dabble&quot; didn't go over too well, because at 
              the time they were still struggling to find evidence that Bone Bed 
              2 was a bison jump. </p>
            <p class="text">During that December and January, the Bone Cave crew 
              learned first hand why the place was called Ice Box Cave. Even on 
              sunny days the cave stayed cold, an average difference of at least 
              10 degrees F. On the days following a norther's cold blast of arctic 
              air, working conditions were miserable. Day after day they worked 
              in the tight confines of 10-ft squares, hemmed in between bones, 
              almost motionless in a cold, dark hole. Elton Prewitt remembers 
              that the campfire area they had originally set up outside the shelter 
              was moved inside and lit as soon as they arrived every morning. 
              He also recalls warming his tortilla-wrapped beans in the coals 
              for a hot lunch.</p>
            <p class="text">The archeologists continued to probe the shelter's 
              deposits&#151;and probe for answers. Several of the excavation units 
              were dug through the second deep bone bed and still deeper layers 
              of bone were encountered. The deepest layers were collectively called 
              &quot;Bone Bed 1;&quot; it consisted of the bones of various extinct 
              animals including mammoth, horse, bison, camel, and antelope. Based 
              on the depth below Bone Bed 2 and the mix of Pleistocene fauna, 
              Dibble guessed that Bone Bed 1 must date at least several thousand 
              years earlier, well into the latter part of the last Ice Age. But 
              with time running out, they only were able to sample a relatively 
              small part of this deepest bone bed, and no definitive sign of a 
              human presence was found with it. Several out-of-place limestone 
              boulders were found amid the bones along with a number of splintered 
              bone fragments that suggested the boulders had been used as anvil 
              stones. Nonetheless, the absence of chipped stone tools left the 
              question open&#151;and it was to remain open.</p>
            <p class="text">On February 28, 1964, the fieldwork drew to a close. 
              While the crew collected the last soil samples and hauled away the 
              last bags of dirt and the digging gear, Dibble stared at the excavation 
              walls and reviewed his field interpretations. From his daily journal 
              entry: &quot;The observing of possible layering at the south end 
              of the site has made me wonder if our previous understanding &#133; 
              was not somewhat premature.&quot; He was referring to the notion 
              that Bone Bed 2 represented a single event. (He later realized that 
              Bone Bed 2 formed as the result of at least three successive events.) 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Like all good archeologists dealing with complex deposits, 
              Dibble had to leave the site behind with at least as many unanswered 
              questions as when he arrived. The excavation units were left open, 
              in part because the site was protected by the shelter roof and by 
              the landowner, and in part because of the lingering questions and 
              unexploited opportunities. Was Bone Bed 2 a single event or several 
              closely spaced ones? Were humans involved in Bone Bed 1? Where was 
              the bottom of the shelter? What, if anything, of interest lay below 
              Bone Bed 1? Some of these questions could be answered by the information 
              and samples that were already in hand, but others demanded more 
              fieldwork.</p>
            <p class="text">In June, Dave Dibble led a small group back to what 
              was now called Bonfire Shelter (the name Bone Cave had already been 
              bestowed on another Paleoindian site). The purpose of the June 1964 
              trip was to take two pollen columns from the walls of the deepest 
              excavation units. By calculating the changing frequencies of different 
              types of plant pollen through time (up and down the stratigraphic 
              profile at Bonfire, for instance), palynologists can reconstruct 
              past climates and track changes over time. </p>
            <p class="text">Over the next few years, Dibble worked on the analysis 
              and reporting of the site. A graduate student in paleontology, Dessamae 
              Lorrain, studied the animal bones and tried to reconstruct the original 
              size of the animals, the number of animals, and the herd structure 
              represented by the bone beds. Several reports were written. The 
              first, by Dibble, was sent to the National Park Service to fulfill 
              the terms of the contract under which the work was done. But this 
              technical report was only produced in limited copies; the importance 
              of the site demanded wider distribution. Dibble's report was revised 
              and formally published in 1968 along with a study of the bones by 
              Lorrain. This remains the most important source of information on 
              Bonfire Shelter.</p>
           <h3><a name="later"></a>20 Years Later: The 1983-1984 Investigations</h3>
            <p class="text">Almost 20 years after the first major excavations, 
              Dave Dibble's ambition of returning to Bonfire and investigating 
              Bone Bed 1 using more modern excavation techniques was finally realized. 
              Although poor health limited him to only occasional visits to the 
              site during the 1983-1984 work, Dibble served as the Principal Investigator 
              for a team led by Dr. Solveig Turpin. Their mission was to open 
              up a larger area of Bone Bed 1 and to collect samples useful for 
              providing more-precise dating of Bonfire's lower deposits as well 
              as materials that would allow sophisticated stratigraphic, environmental, 
              and climatic analyses. Of course, the driving goal was to find what 
              had eluded the earlier excavations: unassailable proof that humans 
              were involved in the creation of Bone Bed 1. Given the antiquity 
              of that deposit, evidence of that sort would have to be vigorously 
              defended in the larger&#151;and somewhat contentious&#151;scientific 
              community. </p>
            <p class="text">According to the prevailing &quot;Clovis First&quot; 
              hypothesis, humans had first crossed the Bering Land Bridge from 
              Siberia into North America about 13,500 years ago (11,500 B.C.) 
              and then rapidly spread across the continent. Therefore, claims 
              of cultural remains in North America dating earlier than 13,500 
              years ago are automatically viewed with suspicion by many Paleoindian 
              experts. For good reason, too, because through the years, many such 
              claims have been shown to be erroneous. A good example is the 1957 
              report of the Lewisville site near Denton, Texas, where a Clovis 
              point was reportedly associated with several apparent hearths that 
              yielded charcoal which was radiocarbon dated to 37,000 years old. 
              The claim was met with great skepticism and soon dismissed by most 
              as implausible. Years later it was learned that the so-called charcoal 
              that had been dated was actually a mix of wood charcoal and lignite 
              (natural coal, an organic material of ancient origin). Many other 
              claims of great antiquity for humans in the New World have been 
              discredited because of similar and other problems.</p>
            <p class="text">With this backdrop, you can see why Dibble's hunch 
              that Bone Bed 1 was at least in part the work of humans and probably 
              pre-dated Clovis could only be substantiated by indisputable evidence, 
              preferably stone tools in direct association with the bones and 
              with carefully dated wood charcoal from an obvious hearth. For 20 
              years Dibble had dreamed about finding &quot;smoking-gun&quot; evidence 
              in Bone Bed 1. Twenty years may seem like a long time to wait, but 
              major archeological excavations are not easy to pull off. While 
              the digging may seem like it ought to be fast and easy, and sometimes 
              it is, many obstacles must be cleared before shovel and trowel come 
              to hand.</p>
            <p class="text">Landowner permission was easy; Jack Skiles had been 
              waiting for decades for archeologists to satisfy his own curiosity. 
              He found the Ice-age animal bones fascinating in and of themselves, 
              whether or not humans had put them there, and he wanted to learn 
              more about the now-extinct animals that once had roamed the land. 
              And he had vowed not to fill in the deepest 1963-1964 pit until 
              the archeologists returned and hit rock bottom&#151;the original 
              bedrock floor of the cave, the layer beneath which no more bones 
              or artifacts could exist.</p>
            <h3>The Funding Challenge</h3>
            <p class="text">A bigger challenge was finding the money needed to 
              support a proper dig. Scientific archeology is expensive&#151;perhaps 
              not when compared to the cost of launching a business, or fielding 
              a football team, or building a house, but all those ventures are 
              a great deal easier to fund. Doing archeology is pure research and 
              no one's life depends on it. Returning to Bonfire would take a concerted 
              fund-raising effort and a bit of luck.</p>
            <p class="text">The original work at Bonfire was government funded, 
              part of the larger research effort conducted in advance of the filling 
              of Amistad Reservoir. But in 1983 there was no such governmental 
              interest in Bonfire&#151;it sits comfortably above the maximum lake 
              level and remains in private hands. Fortunately for our story an 
              unexpected opportunity arose: Author James Michener decided to write 
              a book about Texas and moved to Austin. Michener's earlier book 
              on Colorado had opened with the arrival of earliest humans on the 
              plains of eastern Colorado at about the same time Paleoindians had 
              scared the first herd of buffalo off the cliff above Bonfire. As 
              Michener settled into Austin, speculation had it that he might start 
              his book on Texas in the same way. And what better site than Bonfire 
              to set the scene? According to Solveig Turpin, it was just such 
              thoughts that led UT Austin to decide to help fund a return to Bonfire 
              to finally answer the question the earlier university research project 
              had left dangling: Did Bonfire have the earliest evidence for human 
              presence in Texas?</p>
            <p class="text">Hoping for a positive answer, modest funds were found 
              at the University to help support the project. These funds were 
              matched by the Potts and Sibley Foundation of Midland. Jane and 
              D.J. Sibley had developed a personal interest in the Lower Pecos 
              and had become acquainted with Turpin and Dibble. And so it was 
              that the funds were raised for the return to Bonfire. The money 
              was just barely enough to cover the minimal expenses assuming that 
              a hungry crew could be found and that major logistical impediments 
              could be overcome with surplus scraps, borrowed equipment, and ingenuity. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The hungry crew was assembled in Austin from graduate 
              students and young professional archeologists between contract projects. 
              The pay wasn't much and the hours would stretch long beyond a 40-hour 
              week, but Bonfire already had achieved near mythical status in archeological 
              lore. Bement remembers the surprised look on one crew member's face 
              when he found out that Dave Dibble's promise to pay him &quot;six-eighty&quot; 
              meant $680 per month rather than the princely sum of $6.80 per hour 
              that he had been counting on. The crew agreed to cut-rate pay because 
              they wanted to dig at Bonfire.</p>
            <p class="text">To get to the bottom of the shelter's deposits and 
              be able to see what they were doing, the archeologists would need 
              some heavy equipment and a whole lot of light. They needed to haul 
              hundreds of pounds of equipment and samples in and out of Mile Canyon. 
              The 1963-64 work had been done on the cheap and done with minimal 
              equipment. One of the constraining factors that had hampered Dibble's 
              first investigations in the deeper parts of the central area of 
              the shelter was the lack of adequate illumination. Good lighting 
              is essential to be able to see subtle differences in color and texture 
              that often provide the most important clues in unraveling complex 
              deposits. </p>
            <p class="text">And there was the &quot;big rock&quot; problem. The 
              lower deposits at Bonfire contained some very large boulders&#151;some 
              as big as a stove&#151;and weighing up to a ton. If you couldn't 
              remove or move them, you had to work around them, and that was hard 
              to do in the confines of a relatively small excavation pit. Finally, 
              there was the problem of getting the crew in and out of the canyon, 
              day in, day out. During the first dig, everything and everybody 
              came in and out on foot, a fact which cut down on the available 
              excavation time and severely limited what went in and out of Mile 
              Canyon. </p>
           <h3 ><a name="problems"></a>Solving the Logistical Problems</h3>
            <p class="text">The new investigations at Bonfire were supposed to 
              get underway early in the fall of 1982, but the funding was delayed 
              for several months. Finally in November, 1982, the advance crew 
              arrived in Langtry and began tackling the logistics. Over a period 
              of several months Turpin's team solved every challenge, one by one, 
              mostly through ingenuity and hard work. The budget did not allow 
              them to purchase new equipment or even lease what they needed; instead 
              they had to scrounge and improvise. </p>
            <p class="text">The 1963-1964 team had come in and out of the canyon 
              the long way, following established goat trails down the opposite 
              canyon wall, through the canyon, and up to Bonfire. This required 
              at least 45 minutes each way, more if it was particularly hot or 
              if you were carrying much. The 1983 solution was to enter Bonfire 
              Shelter almost the same way the buffalo did&#151;straight down the 
              cliff&#151;and, unlike the beasts, the archeologists and their supplies 
              left the shelter each day and took the opposite route&#151;straight 
              up the cliff.</p>
            <p class="text">Equipment was hauled down and samples hauled up with 
              the use of a heavy winch truck, parked at the top of the cliff. 
              Electricity was provided by an Army-surplus, 4-wheel drive, 24-volt 
              truck fondly and cursedly known as the &quot;Elephant.&quot; A large 
              spool of heavy electrical cable was donated by the University&#151;someone 
              had ordered too much for a campus construction project. Banks of 
              lights were assembled from used materials found at University Surplus. 
              And so on.</p>
            <p class="text">The winch truck would work for equipment, but people 
              required a different solution. A very long ladder was constructed 
              out of galvanized pipe and heavy rebar. Crew chief and logistical 
              &quot;jefe&quot; Herb Eling was the only archeologist on the crew 
              who already knew how to weld. Using his arc-welder and Jack Skiles' 
              acetylene torch, the crew learned how to weld as they laboriously 
              assembled sections of a sturdy ladder that would span over 80 feet 
              when completed. As they welded rebar rungs to the pipe uprights, 
              Bement recalls thinking about what could happen if one of the rungs 
              gave way while he was climbing the ladder:<b> ...splat!</b> Each 
              weld was checked and rechecked. Finally the sections of the ladder 
              were joined and it was time for the installation. </p>
            <p class="text">They chose a spot that required the shortest span 
              of ladder to get people up and down the cliff. This meant placing 
              the ladder on a section of the cliff that was truly vertical. Eighty 
              feet down and &quot;splat&quot; without a ladder, just like the 
              buffalo. Using the winch truck, they lowered the ladder into place 
              and then, dangling from a steel cable, they used a star drill to 
              attach rebar &quot;legs&quot;&#151;supports that tied the ladder 
              to the cliff. During trial trips up and down the ladder, the swaying 
              to and fro proved unnerving so additional supports were added. Still, 
              it was intimidating.</p>
            <p class="text">Lee Bement admits that he was afraid of heights and 
              not at all thrilled about the prospects of going up and down the 
              ladder daily. Making matters worse was the fact that the top of 
              the ladder was actually well below the cliff top, in a place where 
              the terrain sloped steeply before the vertical drop. In other words, 
              you had to climb partway down the steep slope before getting to 
              the top of the ladder and then look down to a straight drop. At 
              first the crew used a safety belt clipped to a rebar rail that ran 
              beside the ladder, but this routine made going very slow and cumbersome 
              and was soon abandoned. Within the first few weeks, the ladder became 
              routine for everybody, even Bement. Well, almost everybody. One 
              woman refused to even consider making the climb down until after 
              dark, when she could not see what lay below. Bement himself found 
              it much easier to climb the ladder in the blissful darkness.</p>
            <p class="text">Within the shelter, the logistics were almost as challenging 
              as the cliff itself. The new excavations would expand on the deepest 
              excavation unit in the central area of the shelter. To remove buckets 
              of soil and move heavy boulders out of the way within the increasingly 
              deep excavation unit, a heavy pipe was suspended above the hole 
              using A-frame supports welded in place. A heavy block-and-tackle 
              was attached to this to hoist backdirt&#151;soil removed from the 
              excavation&#151;and roof spalls out of the hole in heavy-duty, 5-gallon 
              buckets and then placed on an improvised mining trolly (low cart). 
              The loaded cart was trundled along on a wooden track that ran alongside 
              the old excavation units. At the end of the track, the buckets were 
              emptied into the southernmost excavation units left open in 1964. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Artificial lighting allowed the crew to work on into 
              the night. They had banks of fluorescent lights and incandescent 
              lights and learned to alternate these to &quot;pull out different 
              strata.&quot; Bement explained that under the incandescent lights 
              you could discern bone and darker zones in the excavation profiles, 
              while the fluorescent lights proved better for examining lighter 
              colored lenses. Using these different wave-length lights, the 1983-1984 
              excavators were able to make out subtle stratigraphic details not 
              seen by the earlier investigators. </p>
           <h3><a name="search"></a>Search for the Smoking Gun</h3>
            <p class="text">The excavations finally got underway in January of 
              1983. After cleaning out the old units and opening up two new ones 
              adjacent to the existing hole, the early bone beds were finally 
              reached. The main excavation block encompassed some new ground as 
              well as part of the 1964 unit that had only been excavated through 
              Bone Bed 2. This meant that the excavation block had to be taken 
              down in different segments. The new units exposed more of Bone Bed 
              2 at the same time that renewed excavations in certain of the older 
              units were encountering Bone Bed 1. The complexity of the deposits 
              soon became apparent. Having more time, better lighting, and larger 
              exposures, the 1983 investigators defined more layers than could 
              be accommodated using the original labeling scheme.</p>
            <p class="text">A new system was devised and Bone Beds 2 and 1 were 
              redefined as a series of bone-bearing strata that included three 
              layers within Bone Bed 2 and five additional layers that lay within 
              and below the original Bone Bed 1. The excavations were painstakingly 
              slow, even taking into consideration the logistics. Each significant 
              bone fragment (aside from the smallest unidentifiable scraps) was 
              carefully exposed and then immediately coated with a penetrating 
              preservative that held the fragile bones together. Once solidified, 
              the bones were plotted on a map and removed. Larger and more-fragile 
              bones had to be jacketed in plaster of Paris. The enveloping soil 
              matrix was removed and screened to search for small bones and stone 
              tool fragments. </p>
            <p class="text">But try as they might, the excavators could find no 
              stone tools&#151;large or small&#151;below Bone Bed 2. Nor did they 
              find a hearth or other definitive human construction. What they 
              did find was tantalizing. Limestone blocks bigger than a basketball 
              around which were arrayed the broken and splintered long bones of 
              extinct bison, horse, mammoth, and camel, among others. Some bones 
              looked like they had tiny cut marks from stone tools. Others looked 
              worn at one end and were thought to represent bone tools. But no 
              smoking gun. </p>
            <p class="text">By April of 1983 funds had run out and the excavations 
              were not completed. They still had more of the lower bone-bearing 
              strata to dig through, and they had not even come close to the bottom 
              of the shelter. Over the next year a small amount of additional 
              funding was secured and in April, 1984, the crew returned for a 
              final four-week stint. Although some of the most interesting and 
              intriguing arrangements of bones and limestone blocks were found, 
              there was still no smoking gun. As time ran out, the archeologists 
              dug a small test pit in the deepest area of the excavation block 
              to try and reach &quot;rock bottom&quot; and make Jack Skiles happy. 
              Deeper and deeper they dug until they reached a large boulder covering 
              most of the floor of the excavation hole. Was this the bottom of 
              the cave?</p>
            <p class="text">Bement worked down one corner of the unit around the 
              boulder and then stuck his arm down as far as he could go. The fill 
              he pulled up from the lowest point he could reach was composed of 
              water-smoothed gravels, evidence of a time when the floor of Mile 
              Canyon was at a much higher level relative to its modern floor. 
              Floodwaters had obviously pushed into the shelter at that time and 
              left behind the gravels. But was this really the bottom? There was 
              no time left to dig. So Jack Skiles welded together two pieces of 
              rebar to form a long rod. This he hammered down into the small hole 
              Bement had dug and into the gravels. At six feet below the deepest 
              point Bement had reached, Skiles could drive the rod no further. 
              Had he reached bedrock or another boulder?</p>
            <p class="text">The 1983-1984 field investigations ended without a 
              definitive answer to that question and without a smoking gun. Many 
              other objectives had been met that made the work more than worthwhile. 
              The layering of Bone Beds 1 and 2 was now well documented. Over 
              400 bones had been documented and collected. Soil column samples 
              were collected for pollen analysis, sediment analysis, and microfaunal 
              (small bones) analysis. Samples of charred bone and wood were collected 
              for radiocarbon dating. Lee Bement took on the analysis of the bones 
              for his M.A. thesis project; the published version served as the 
              final report on the 1983-1984 work.</p>

            <p class="text">The 1983-1984 work had filled in many of the original 
              excavation units and helped protect the remaining deposits, but 
              one problem area remained. Occasional heavy runoff had caused considerable 
              erosion in the talus slope area where Bone Bed 3 was concentrated. 
              This area had been partially covered with a black-mesh landscape 
              cloth in an earlier attempt to protect it from erosion, but the 
              cloth had deteriorated. </p>
            <p class="text">In 1989, Elton Prewitt visited Bonfire for the first 
              time since 1973 and was shocked at the amount of erosion on the 
              talus cone. In 1990, with a $250 grant from the Donors' Fund of 
              the Texas Archeological Society, he organized a return to Bonfire 
              to stabilize the talus cone deposits. Burlap bags were sewn together 
              to form a protective covering that was draped over the slope. A 
              layer of heavy, orange plastic safety netting was added to hold 
              the burlap covering in place. Rocks and metal stakes were added 
              to hold down the edges of the protective covering. The result has 
              proven effective.</p>
