		    <p class="text">The thousands of bones that archeologists have carefully 
              collected from Bonfire Shelter have quite a lot to say. If the bones 
              actually could talk, they might be able to tell us fascinating things 
              about the past including the details of how they came to rest where 
              they were found. But they can't and so we must rely on faunal (animal) 
              experts, archeologists, or paleontologists who develop specialized 
              knowledge about animal bones, to study the bones and speak for them. 
            <p class="text">What the faunal experts can tell us has a great deal 
              to do with the kinds of questions they pose in the first place. 
              Usually they start with basic questions&#151;what animal is this 
              bone from? Which specific bone element is this fragment a part of? 
              But as they figure out the basics, they start asking more difficult 
              &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; questions. How were the buffalo 
              butchered? Why did the bones catch on fire? </p>
            <p class="text">Regardless of the evidence we might muster to answer 
              such questions, there really is not much in archeology that we can 
              prove beyond doubt. We are usually dealing with the remote human 
              past that left behind no eyewitness accounts, only mute bones and 
              stones. What we can hope for, however, is greater insight and understanding. 
              Although scientists may hold different opinions, it really isn't 
              about being right; it's about trying to understand what the bones 
              can tell us about what happened at Bonfire shelter.</p>
            <p class="text">Below we look at some of the more-interesting things 
              that have been learned from studying the bones and other kinds of 
              evidence found within the bone beds at Bonfire. </p>

            <h3><a name="bones"></a>The Bones</h3>
            <p class="text">Two &quot;bone jocks,&quot; as faunal experts are 
              sometimes known, have studied bones from Bonfire Shelter. Dessamae 
              Lorrain studied the bones from the 1963-64 excavations, and Lee 
              Bement, the bones from the 1983-84 work. Both took on the studies 
              as their Masters thesis projects at UT-Austin. Lorrain had the advantage 
              (and disadvantage) of working with a much larger sample and of being 
              able to compare the Bone Bed 2 and 3 assemblages, but she did not 
              participate (except briefly) in the fieldwork. Bement worked with 
              smaller samples, but he was able to observe the bones firsthand 
              as the fieldwork progressed and he could compare Bone Bed 1 with 
              Bone Bed 2 (and BB3 for that matter). Both were guided by Dr. Ernest 
              Lundelius, one of the foremost experts on Late Pleistocene fauna 
              in North America, and former Director of the Vertebrate Paleontology 
              (VP) Laboratory at UT-Austin. </p>
            <p class="text">Today the excavated bones from Bonfire are kept in 
              neatly labeled wooden drawers within the rows of metal cabinets 
              that line the &quot;big room&quot; at the VP Lab. They are stored 
              here for posterity (the future) because of their research value, 
              awaiting one of several future uses. Sometimes the bones from Bonfire 
              are used for comparative purposes&#151;a researcher studying bison 
              bones at another kill site might want to compare sizes, species, 
              breakage patterns and so on. But their most important value is their 
              potential to address new questions and provide new information. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Perhaps the best example of untapped potential in 
              the Bonfire collection is the microfauna&#151;vial upon vial of 
              tiny bones from rats, mice, gophers , birds, snakes, and other small 
              animals. These bones were collected as part of a special set of 
              soil samples from a column carved layer by layer from the side of 
              one of the deep excavation pits. The bags of dirt were hauled back 
              to Austin and then washed through fine mesh sieves that capture 
              even the tiniest fragment. Then the hard part comes: someone has 
              to spend hundreds of hours picking through each pile of bone fragments 
              (and pieces of stone and other debris) to sort out the &quot;wheat 
              from the chaff&quot;&#151;or in this case, the identifiable bones 
              from the miscellaneous fragments. </p>
            <p class="text">What makes one bone fragment identifiable and the 
              next one not? Experts look for distinctive features, especially 
              whole bones and bone fragments bearing the intact ends of a bone, 
              such as the ball joint where the femur (upper leg) fits into the 
              hip (pelvis) socket. But telling the difference between the tiny 
              femur of a pack rat and the tiny femur of a wood rat can be mighty 
              tricky. The easiest bones to identify among the small animals are 
              usually the teeth. Teeth are especially important because they are 
              harder and more durable than most other bones, hence, most likely 
              to survive the passage of time.</p>
            <p class="text">Although the Bonfire microfauna collection has never 
              been fully analyzed, it holds enormous potential to answer many 
              questions. Here's one example: scientists know that small creatures 
              are much more sensitive to environmental change than most large 
              animals. While creatures large and small are equally affected by 
              such drastic changes as the end of the last Ice Age, large animals 
              like deer and bison are mobile and can survive smaller events&#151;droughts 
              and floods&#151;just by moving. In contrast, mice and gophers cannot 
              move very far. When climatic conditions gradually shift from wet 
              to dry, small animal populations change in response; water-loving 
              rodents die and over time are replaced by those that do well in 
              the desert. By looking at the percentages of one kind to the other 
              through time, these tiny bones can tell us a lot about how the local 
              environment around Bonfire has changed. The microfauna are just 
              one example of the continuing research value of the Bonfire bone 
              collections.</p>
            <p class="text">You might be wondering how all the rodent bones ended 
              up in Bonfire. Most of the bones, it appears, did not go there of 
              their own accord. Owls and hawks both eat a lot of small animals 
              and like to roost or perch on high, protected spots like the top 
              of the roof blocks at the mouth of Bonfire. These big birds eat 
              the rodents whole, bones and all. The crunched-up bones (with many 
              identifiable pieces) go through the bird's digestive system and 
              end up as &quot;pellets&quot; on the floor of Bonfire shelter. These 
              gradually break apart as they weather and the tiny bones become 
              part of the cave sediments. </p>
            <p class="text">The larger bones in the Bonfire collection have much 
              to tell us as well. The most numerous, of course, are the bison 
              bones. In the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory are drawer after 
              drawer of bison bones, each containing a different type of bone 
              or several similar bones. Each drawer tells a different part of 
              the Bonfire story.</p>
            <p class="text">Bison feet bones are typically well preserved because 
              they are relatively small and durable and because they are quickly 
              discarded during butchering in favor of the meaty bones. Most of 
              the feet bones were whole when found. </p>
            <p class="text">In contrast, far fewer whole leg bones were found, 
              and of those, most were the smaller ones. The larger leg bones are 
              the main meat-bearing bones. The cavities within large leg bones, 
              especially the femur, tibia, and humerus, are filled with marrow, 
              which is full of fat and is, thus, highly desirable. While today 
              many people try to avoid eating too much fat, the prehistoric Indians 
              of the region had few sources of fat. Most meat is lean and contains 
              little fat; the same is true for most plant foods (except nuts and 
              seeds). So fat would have been craved, and fresh marrow is actually 
              quite delicious. This explains why most of the leg bones from Bonfire 
              are broken up, having had the marrow extracted by the prehistoric 
              butchers.</p>
            <p class="text">The skulls, too, are typically smashed, and the jaws 
              broken apart. In this case, it is the brains and tongue that were 
              being removed. Skulls were also broken up to remove the horns and 
              horn cores. Bison horns were used in many dances and other ceremonies 
              of later Plains Indians, and there is reason to believe that Paleoindians 
              also placed special importance on bison skulls and horns. The most 
              spectacular example is the now-famous painted bison skull from the 
              Cooper site, a Folsom kill site in northwest Oklahoma that Lee Bement 
              excavated. This skull had a red zig-zag emblem painted on the forehead 
              and was apparently placed atop a pile of butchered bison bone as 
              a ritual offering. (For details see <a href="http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/B/Leland.C.Bement-1/" target="_blank" class="text">Bement's 
              Cooper web page</a> or a special article in <a href="http://www.peak.org/csfa/crp14-03.html" target="_blank" class="text">Current 
              Research in the Pleistocene</a>).</p>
            <p class="text">Notice that bison bones from Bonfire show quite a 
              range of color. (The glossy appearance is caused by wax, which was 
              added in the lab as a preservative.) Some of the bones are black 
              and charred, while others look like fairly fresh bone, while still 
              others look bleached and weathered. These variations reflect where 
              the bones came from in the deposits, how old they are, and how much 
              time they spent on the surface before being covered by cave dust 
              or more bones. Such factors also affect whether a given bone will 
              be preserved at all or whether the bone surfaces preserve the evidence 
              we need to figure out butchering and predator patterns. </p>
            <p class="text">Many of the bones from Bone Bed 3 were so completely 
              incinerated that they fell apart as soon as the archeologists tried 
              to lift them up. Sometimes a special glue-like preservative was 
              slathered on the bones to try to hold them together, but this messy 
              process glued together dirt and ash as well as bone and was very 
              time consuming. There were so many bones in Bone Beds 2 and 3 that 
              the archeologists ended up having to concentrate chiefly on the 
              intact and better-preserved pieces. </p>
            <p class="text">Most of the very old bones from Bone Bed 1 were in 
              poor condition. These required special coating with a penetrating 
              preservative as a routine step, otherwise they would have crumbled 
              apart soon after exposure. But this effort was worthwhile because 
              it enabled archeologists to recover the bones of extinct animals 
              including camel, horse, and mammoth. </p>

            <h3><a name="fires"></a>The Bone Fires</h3>
            <p class="text">Bonfire Shelter witnessed two major bone fires or 
              bonfires in its history; the really massive one that scorched and 
              burned almost all of Bone Bed 3 about 2800 years ago, and a somewhat 
              smaller fire in Bone Bed 2 at least 11,300 years ago. Both fires 
              appear to be the result of cataclysms caused by spontaneous combustion 
              as the steaming, rotting piles of partially butchered bison carcasses 
              reached critical mass. </p>
            <p class="text">The most spectacular and best-documented bonfire was 
              that of Bone Bed 3, the fiery event that inspired the name Bonfire 
              Shelter. Here is how archeologist Dave Dibble started his discussion 
              of the matter in his 1968 report:</p>
            <p class="text"><em>A few facts regarding the burning of the bison 
              bones became apparent during excavation: 1) the fire was a one-time 
              occurrence rather than a series of blazes; 2) the burning occurred 
              in place; (3) no evidence of fuel, charcoal or other (sic), was 
              observed in the burned portion of the bed; and 4) the burning was 
              sufficiently intense to oxidize virtually all carbon in the bones, 
              reduce limestone spalls to powdered lime, and to shatter and glaze 
              many of the chert artifacts included in the deposit. </em></p>
            <p class="text">As a point of interest: the word bonfire has been 
              traced back to the late 1400s when the terms<em> banefyre</em> and 
              <em>bone fyre</em> described fires built of &quot;clene bones and 
              noo woode&quot; in public celebration of certain saints (<em>Oxford 
              English Dictionary</em>). While today the term is generally applied 
              to large wood fires for public spectacle, inspiration, and celebration, 
              the word's origin recognizes the obvious: bones are full of fat 
              and will burn quite readily when heaped up. And it need not take 
              a spark or match to ignite; decaying mounds of bone, hide, hair, 
              and flesh give off gas and can build up tremendous heat, just like 
              a pile of oily rags, and can burst into flame spontaneously under 
              just the right conditions. Modern slaughterhouses are said to be 
              well aware of this possibility and avoid creating heaps of bones 
              and debris as a safety precaution. Fires lasting weeks or months 
              are recorded from the cattle-trail boneyards that formed at slaughterhouses 
              and railheads upon the Great Plains in the late 1800s. Dibble cited 
              several other bison jump sites in the northern plains that also 
              had extensive deposits of charred bones, suggesting that the Bonfire 
              Shelter bone fires were not unusual occurrences. </p>
            <p class="text">Not unusual, perhaps, and explainable, but the Bone 
              Bed 3 inferno must have been quite the spectacle for anyone near 
              Mile Canyon at that time long ago. It started with a tremendous 
              boom as the built-up gases literally exploded and the concussive 
              sound waves ricocheted off the shelter walls and up and down the 
              steep-sided canyon. The flames may have burned for days, sending 
              up greasy black smoke surely visible for many miles. And what the 
              eye missed, the nose would detect. One imagines what the locals 
              must have thought before connecting the unbidden blaze to the even 
              more remarkable event&#151;the unprecedented massive bison kill 
              that had occurred many weeks or even months before. All this is 
              speculative, of course, but it is probably not far short of the 
              fiery mark. Even today, some 2800 years later, the evidence of the 
              last bone &quot;fyre&quot; is still plain to everyone who climbs 
              up to the shelter; what the blind eye might miss, the crunching 
              bones underfoot reveal. </p>
            <div align="center"><img src="images/horse-femur-icon.jpg" alt="Horse femur" width="65" height="30"> </div>
            <h3><a name="bison"></a>The Bison </h3>
            <p class="text">There were bison bones in all three of the bone beds. 
              The bison bones in Bone Beds 1 and 2 were those of an extinct species, 
              either <em>Bison antiquus</em> or <em>Bison occidentalis</em>, while 
              the Bone Bed 3 bones were all of the modern buffalo, <em>Bison bison</em>. 
              The best way of determining the species of extinct bison is to look 
              at intact skulls, but none were found in either deposit. Faunal 
              analyst Lorrain compared a variety of measurements of specific bones 
              from Bone Bed 2 such as the width of the distal (lower) end of the 
              tibia (upper front leg) to the same measurements from Bone Bed 3 
              specimens and those from bison samples at other sites. While she 
              wasn't able to answer the question of species, she did demonstrate 
              that the mature adult bones of the extinct bison at Bonfire were 
              at least 12-18% larger than those of the modern bison. Taking other 
              comparative studies of bison species measurements into consideration, 
              the extinct species at Bonfire was at least 15% larger than modern 
              bison. </p>
            <p class="text">In more concrete terms, a large modern bison bull 
              can weigh as much as a ton (2,240 pounds) and stand 6 feet high, 
              while the adult males of <em>Bison antiquus</em> may have weighed 
              as much as 3,500 pounds and stood 7 1/12 feet high <a href="http://www.texnews.com/1998/2001/local/bone0512.html" target="_blank" class="text">according 
              to Dr. David Meltzer</a>, archeologist and Paleoindian expert at 
              Southern Methodist University in Dallas. From the mindset of a hunter, 
              imagine a full-grown modern buffalo, add a foot or two, and consider 
              the courage it must have taken to get up close to an Ice Age bison 
              and wave a spear or a blanket in its face. </p>

              by Charles Shaw.</div>
            <p class="text">Lorrain estimated that there were bones of 800 bison 
              in Bone Bed 3, mainly cows (adult females) and yearling calves. 
              The absence of adult males and the relative uniformity of the age 
              of the calves led her to argue that Bone Bed 3 formed as the result 
              of a single event that occurred during the late winter or early 
              spring. Dibble had trouble accepting Lorrain's single-event argument 
              and so have other archeologists familiar with the site (including 
              this author). The mass of bones in Bone Bed 3 more likely is the 
              result of multiple jumps that occurred over a relatively short period 
              of time. This debate is discussed in more detail <a href="bb3.html" class="text">elsewhere</a>.</p>
            <p class="text">One event or several, the incinerated condition of 
              much of the bone makes it difficult to say a great deal about what 
              happened after the buffalo jump event(s) that created Bone Bed 3. 
              The finding of at least one intact bison calf skeleton and numerous 
              partial articulations shows that there were so many animals heaped 
              up that the lower ones were either not reached or only partially 
              butchered. Given that over 50% of the bison in Bone Bed 3 were immature 
              animals, it is likely that some were dragged out of the shelter 
              for butchering. The absence of intact skulls suggests that the heads 
              of most were smashed for the removal of the brains. The uneven counts 
              of certain bones show that some parts of the animals were removed 
              from the shelter, especially the forequarters and hindquarters, 
              minus the feet and hooves, which were cut off and discarded on the 
              spot.</p>
            <p class="text">Faunal analyst Lorrain observed that the Late Archaic 
              butchers who worked the bones in Bone Bed 3 were not as skilled 
              or at least not as careful as the earlier Paleoindian butchers. 
              The prime evidence is the difference in how the legs were severed 
              from the bodies. In Bone Bed 2, the ends of the leg bones that fit 
              into the sockets in the pelvis and scapula were intact and sometimes 
              showed cutmarks from severing the tendons and joining tissues. In 
              Bone Bed 3, the ball joints were often smashed. This is likely simply 
              a reflection of the greater mass of meat&#151;there was no need 
              to &quot;waste not;&quot; the successful hunters and their families 
              did not &quot;wont&quot; for meat for many moons.</p>
            <p class="text">The relatively small number of butchering tools found 
              amid the bones suggests that most of the butchering took place outside 
              the confines of Bonfire Shelter, a not-surprising inference for 
              several reasons. The only real tasks that had to be done upon the 
              mass of dead animals would have been the initial stages of butchering 
              wherein the animals were cut open, the favorite pieces removed (tongues, 
              brains, and stomach contents), and the major meat parts&#151;probably 
              forequarters, hindquarters and backstraps&#151;were cut loose and 
              carried out of the shelter. In order to make use of the bonanza, 
              the meat would have been cut into strips and hung to dry in the 
              sun or perhaps smoked. Either way, it must have taken weeks of work 
              to preserve and cart off the meat. Most of this work probably took 
              place outside the shelter within the canyon, where meat strips could 
              be spread out on numerous large, clean boulders and hung from trees, 
              bushes, and pole frames. Along the canyon floor are also extensive 
              flat areas of exposed bedrock as well as gravel bars that may have 
              served as work areas for the multi-step process of hide preparation: 
              defleshing, scraping, drying, and tanning. Where exactly these activities 
              took place will never be known, but it wasn't in the shelter.</p>
            <p class="text">It is also worth noting that there wasn't much evidence 
              of any sort of activities elsewhere within Bonfire Shelter away 
              from the main Bone-Bed 3 deposit. The only indication at all of 
              occupation, apart from the bone bed, was two small hearths found 
              near the back of the shelter in the thin, outer part of Bone Bed 
              3. It is, of course, possible that additional materials are still 
              present at the north end of the shelter where only a few test pits 
              were dug.</p>

            <p class="text">It is known that Bone Bed 2 resulted from at least 
              three separate jumps because three distinct layers were clearly 
              visible in certain places within the deposit. Unfortunately, many 
              of the bones from the three or more jumps were mixed together, making 
              it difficult to tell how many animals were killed during each event. 
              A complicating factor is the Bone Bed 2 bonfire, which occurred 
              after the earliest jump(s) and before the latest jump(s). </p>
            <p class="text">Lorrain estimated that a total of 120 animals from 
              an extinct species of bison was present in Bone Bed 2 including 
              bulls (mature males), cows, and calves of differing ages. Bison 
              aren't considered full adults until they reach an age of 5 to 6 
              years. Interestingly, over half of the animals in Bone Bed 3 were 
              immature animals with, the 3- to 4-year-old age group having the 
              greatest numbers. Assuming that the extinct species behaved more 
              or less the same as modern bison, mature bulls would have been with 
              the cows and calves only in certain times of the year, such as the 
              fall rutting season. Taken together, the evidence suggests that 
              the Bone Bed 3 jumps occurred in several different seasons.</p>
            <p class="text"> In contrast to Bone Bed 3 where there was abundant 
              evidence of waste and incomplete butchering amid the dregs of one 
              or several overwhelming successes, the evidence from Bone Bed 2 
              suggests a much more systematic and thorough harvest of smaller 
              kills. Part of the reason we know a lot more about the Bone Bed 
              2 slaughter and its aftermath is simply because most of the evidence 
              in Bone Bed 3 went up in smoke, so to speak, in the conflagration. 
              The earlier Bone Bed 2 blaze was smaller and most of the bones and 
              tools survived unscathed (or came to rest after the Paleo bone-fire). 
            </p>
            <p class="text">By carefully plotting and studying the distribution 
              of different bone elements and by examining the fracture patterns 
              and stone tool cut marks on bones, the archeologists were able to 
              understand how much of the butchering took place within the confines 
              of Bonfire Shelter. What they found was that following each jump 
              the Paleoindians systematically and thoroughly butchered the animals 
              and made use of a great deal of the animals. While little or no 
              direct evidence survives of what they did with the hides and stomach 
              contents, the efficiency with which the animals were dismembered 
              and some of their bones broken apart for marrow extraction leaves 
              little doubt that not much was wasted. </p>
            <p class="text">From the absence of evidence for hide-scraping and 
              cooking fires within the shelter (only one small hearth and a few 
              scraping tools were found), we can infer that much of the post-butchering 
              work took place elsewhere as was the case with Bone Bed 3. But most 
              or all of the primary butchering seems to have taken place within 
              the confines of Bonfire Shelter.</p>
            <p class="text">The patterning of bones across Bone Bed 2 was most 
              interesting. In contrast to Bone Bed 3, the bones in Bone Bed 2 
              were fully disarticulated (pulled apart), sorted into different 
              parts of the animal, and systematically and thoroughly butchered. 
              Despite the careful exposure of relatively large areas of the bone 
              bed during the 1963-64 work, only seven partial articulations were 
              recorded, situations where several of bones were found together 
              in correct anatomical position. When articulated bones are found, 
              it is inferred that they were still held together by flesh and connecting 
              tissue at the time they were originally deposited. Of the seven 
              Bone Bed 2 articulations, most of these were only two bones, indicating 
              only a relatively small part of the animal. Compare this to the 
              90 articulations recorded in Bone Bed 3, where the burning hampered 
              investigation. Many of these articulations were entire limbs or 
              vertebral columns and in at least one case, a virtually complete 
              skeleton. In Bone Bed 2 there was much less evidence of waste.</p>
            <p class="text">Based on her analysis of the Bone Bed 2 bones, Lorrain 
              outlined a fairly detailed two-step process and showed that the 
              entire butchering process took place in the shelter. The first step 
              was to cut apart the animal and separate the major parts that yielded 
              different things and/or required different butchering techniques. 
              Although short on articulations, Bone Bed 2 contained considerable 
              evidence of the animals being divided into sections and parts and 
              sorted into piles of like kind. For example, a concentration of 
              partial skulls (mostly the maxilla or upper palate), mandibles, 
              and atlas and axis vertebrae (the uppermost in the spinal column) 
              was recorded near the rear of the shelter near the one hearth that 
              was found in Bone Bed 2. The upper part of the skulls and horn cores 
              were found clustered in another area of the shelter. A stack of 
              at least seven scapulae was recorded that must have been gathered 
              after being separated from the frontquarter. For what purpose is 
              unknown; perhaps they were just set aside for discard. The bones 
              of the major meat units, the frontquarters (humerus, radius, and 
              ulna) and hindquarters (tibia and femur) show similar distributions, 
              suggesting that the meaty legs were separated from the carcass and 
              from the feet and then butchered in one general area of the shelter. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">After the prehistoric butchers completed the sorting 
              process, the second step was to complete the butchering of each 
              group. The skulls were cut and bashed apart at the back of the skull, 
              presumably to extract the brains. The mandibles (lower jaws) were 
              split apart and separated from the maxilla, probably to free the 
              tongue. Lorrain suggested that the concentration of head parts near 
              the hearth might indicate that brains and tongues, parts known to 
              be favorites among historic bison hunters, were eaten on the spot.</p>
            <p class="text">The front and rear legs were cut apart at the joints, 
              and the meat was carefully cut from each bone. Following this the 
              long bones were systematically broken open, no doubt to extract 
              the fat-rich marrow. Because the long-bone fragments were not further 
              crushed and splintered, it is obvious they were not rendered for 
              bone grease, a common practice in later times. This was one of the 
              few steps not taken to extract useful matter. </p>
            <p class="text">One last pattern deserves special mention, that of 
              stone anvils or butcher blocks. Hefty limestone boulders 1 to 2 
              feet (.3 to .6 meters) across were found in several places in Bone 
              Bed 2 amid broken and splintered bones . These boulders were not 
              present elsewhere in the natural layers immediately below and covering 
              the bones, making it clear that they were brought in during the 
              butchering, or perhaps a bit earlier. Such heavy stones also could 
              have served well to dispatch wounded animals. </p>
            <p class="text">While most of the boulders were found in the thick 
              of things where it is more difficult to sort out which specific 
              bones they were associated with, better-defined evidence was documented 
              during the 1983-84 investigations at the base of Bone Bed 2. There 
              (Stratum C), a spoke-like pattern of long bones was found arrayed 
              around a broken limestone rock. The bones included those from at 
              least three bison and a young horse. Several of the bones were broken, 
              the best example being an ulna with a green (fresh bone) break and 
              battering marks that Bement attributed to its separation from a 
              nearby radius. This scene suggests that the Paleoindian butchers 
              broke the leg bones atop the stones, as a modern-day butcher would 
              use a butcher block. </p>

            <h3> <a name="bb1predators"></a>Who Were the Bone Bed 1 Predators?</h3>
            <p class="text">Dibble and Bement both argued that humans were the 
              primary predators responsible for the accumulation of bones in Bone 
              Bed 1. Lacking a smoking gun (i.e., definite proof, such as the 
              finding of an obvious chipped-stone tool in unequivocal association 
              with the bones), the argument is based on a series of inferences 
              and both positive and negative evidence. First, however, consider 
              the argument that carnivores were the main predators. </p>
            <p class="text"><b>Carnivores</b></p>
            <p class="text">Bement carefully examined the bones to search for 
              evidence of carnivore behavior. Carnivores such as the Late Pleistocene 
              cats, bears, and wolves tend to leave ample evidence of their work. 
              They kill prey animals in specific ways, sometimes puncturing or 
              breaking the bones of their prey. In the process of devouring their 
              prey, carnivores may break more bones, crunch up small bones, gnaw 
              on large meaty ones, and haul entire animals or favored parts (with 
              or without attached flesh) to feeding stations or into their lairs. 
              Some carnivores scavenge already dead animals as well and may even 
              chew on bones when food is scarce.</p>
            <p class="text">Informed by studies on various carnivore behavioral 
              traits and telltale marks, Bement found only limited evidence for 
              carnivore action on the bone in Bone Bed 1 and in Bone Bed 2, where 
              we know humans were the main predator. In the Stratum H-1 layer 
              within Bone Bed 1, two horse bones had conical punctures as well 
              as carved grooves with U-shaped cross-sections like those made by 
              carnivore canines. A third bone, a mammoth long bone fragment, had 
              three large conical punctures, two of which were a little more than 
              2-inches (5.6-cm) deep. Bement narrowed the possibilities down to 
              the short-faced bear and the sabertoothed cat species known from 
              the region, scimitar cat. Both carnivores had large canines and 
              powerful jaws and are known to have denned in caves. The short-faced 
              bear was the largest and most powerful predator in North America 
              during the Late Pleistocene and was mainly a flesh-eater. Scimitar 
              cat was about as large as a modern lion and had wicked-looking, 
              <a href="images/hal_sabertooth.html" class="text" target="_blank">long-curving 
              fangs</a>. (For another view of scimitar cat, see <a href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson/homotherium_skull.html" target="_blank" class="text">http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/larson<br>
              /homotherium_skull.html</a>).</p>
            <p class="text">Bement used fossil specimens of scimitar cat and the 
              short-faced bear to produce punctures in a piece of Styrofoam the 
              same thickness as that of the mammoth bone and compared these to 
              the size and shape of the holes. What he found was that the size 
              and shape of the punctures in the mammoth bone most closely resembled 
              those of the scimitar cat. Lundelius is not quite convinced because 
              he thinks the short-faced bear had a much stronger bite and would 
              have been much more capable of puncturing a mammoth bone. Either 
              way, something extremely large and powerful obviously played a role 
              in the accumulation of the bones in Stratum H-1.</p>
            <p class="text">The only other conical puncture noted was that in 
              a bison scapula (shoulder bone) in Stratum I (the lowest layer of 
              Bone Bed 1). Bement suggested that this hole compared more favorably 
              to a wolf-sized carnivore. Otherwise, there was very little definitive 
              evidence of carnivores. Two juvenile horse long bones also in Stratum 
              H-1 were missing one end and resembled wolf-chewed bones known from 
              other sites. But many of the other breakage patterns often associated 
              with carnivores were not seen in the Bonfire bone assemblage. There 
              were, for example, numerous long bones from juvenile horses and 
              bison that did not show carnivore damage, as might be expected if 
              the bones accumulated in a den. Bement argued that the relative 
              dearth of carnivore evidence weakens the carnivore-only hypothesis. 
              The conical punctures show that one or several carnivores were present 
              at Bonfire and did chew on horse, mammoth and bison bones, but were 
              scimitar cats, wolves, and/or short-faced bears the primary predators 
              or after-the-fact scavengers?</p>
            <p class="text"><b>Humans as Predators</b></p>
            <p class="text">Multiple lines of evidence suggest that humans played 
              a significant role in the accumulation of Bone Bed 1. Apparent cut 
              marks were found on several different bones in Strata H-1 and I. 
              Cuts made on fresh bone with a sharp stone tool typically create 
              V-shaped grooves that are distinct from the more-rounded, U-shaped 
              grooves typical of carnivore teeth. Yet both U- and V-shaped marks 
              were found on a single horse femur (lower back leg) in Stratum H-1. 
              Bement suggested that carnivores and humans may both have damaged 
              the bone. In this scenario, the carnivore damage would presumably 
              represent the scavenging of an abandoned butchering site, a pattern 
              well known among wolves and other canines. </p>
            <p class="text">Another clue was the presence of spiral fractures, 
              spiral-shaped green (fresh) bone fractures that are typical of intentional 
              breaks made by humans on fresh bone. Numerous spiral fractures were 
              observed on Bone Bed 1 bones including the broken end of the horse 
              femur shown in the drawing. The problem with using spiral fractures 
              as evidence of human involvement is that they also can be created 
              by carnivores and even by rock falls or water-borne impact. While 
              there is no evidence of either rock falls or stream deposits at 
              Bonfire in Bone Bed 1, there is at least some evidence of large 
              carnivores. </p>
            <p class="text">Perhaps more convincing is the finding of several 
              apparent bone tools. The same horse femur with a spiral fracture 
              and both U- and V-shaped incisions also has what Bement describes 
              as smoothing and polish along the broken edge. He thinks this may 
              well be a butchering tool. Another example is a broken bison ulna 
              (lower front leg) bone that forms a smooth point bearing numerous 
              V-shaped cut marks; Bement interprets this bone as a butchering 
              tool. The finding of numerous apparent cut marks begs the question: 
              where are the stone tools that presumably left the cuts. Perhaps 
              these were removed from the scene or else dropped in a different 
              part of the shelter.</p>
            <p class="text">Yet another suggestive finding in Stratum H-1 is that 
              of several large mammoth bones with small depressions caused by 
              the impact of something hard and/or sharp. Both a pelvis (hip) fragment 
              and a <a href="images/sb22.html" target="_blank" class="text">cervical 
              vertebra</a> (spinal bone from neck) had apparent dents that Bement 
              believes resulted from these large bones being used as anvils during 
              butchering. The opposite face of the vertebra also had numerous 
              small triangular depressions seemingly caused &quot;by pressing 
              a sharp edge into a soft material.&quot; These could have been caused 
              by small angular limestone spalls upon which the bone was lying 
              if a strong force was applied to the opposite face.</p>
            <p class="text">Finally, there is the repeated pattern of the occurrence 
              of large limestone blocks amid the bones in direct association with 
              splintered and broken long bones. This pattern has been documented 
              in the three major Bone Bed 1 layers as well as in Bone Bed 2 and 
              Bone Bed 3. Bement argues that these are butcher blocks or anvils 
              where long bones were broken to extract marrow and upon which other 
              bones were laid during the butchering. See <a href="bb1.html" class="text">Bone 
              Bed 1</a> for details.</p>
            <p class="text">In summary, while much of this evidence is circumstantial 
              and subject to alternative explanation, collectively the various 
              patterns just described led Bement to tentatively accept the idea 
              that humans were the major predator responsible for the accumulation 
              of the bone layers in Bone Bed 1. To explain how the animals were 
              killed, Bement offered the following Natural Trap hypothesis: </p>
            <p class="text"><em>It is proposed here that the E, H-1 and I bone 
              beds resulted from the use of Bonfire Shelter as a natural trap 
              by man. Mile Canyon is a box canyon with limited lateral access 
              and a deep waterhole at its head.... Animals were drawn into this 
              canyon by the waterhole and probably the vegetation it supported. 
              Bonfire Shelter, 1/4 mile downstream from the waterhole, provided 
              a natural trap. Its downstream end would have allowed easy access 
              from the canyon floor while its upper end was sealed by roof collapse. 
              Large roof blocks likewise obstruct the front of the shelter without 
              blocking sunlight. Small groups of animals moving up the canyon 
              toward the waterhole could have been diverted into the shelter where 
              hunters, positioned on the huge roof blocks, could easily kill the 
              animals. Perhaps the limestone blocks associated with the skeletal 
              remains entered the cave as implements of the kill and were later 
              used in the proposed butcher block-bone smashing capacity as a matter 
              of convenience. Following the kill, the animals were butchered within 
              the shelter. Some processing of the meat (such as cooking and drying) 
              may have occurred within the shelter, although a locus for this 
              activity has not yet been found. Abandonment of the shelter upon 
              completion of the butchering process allowed scavengers to enter 
              and further disarticulate, distribute and digest the bone material.</em></p>
            <p class="text">So, after reading all this and seeing some of the 
              evidence, who do you think was the main predator responsible for 
              the Bone Bed 1 accumulations, (hu)man or beast? As far as most archeologists 
              are concerned, the question is still open unless and until a smoking 
              gun can be found.</p>
