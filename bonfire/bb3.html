    <td width="372" valign="top"><p class="text">Bonfire Shelter takes its name from the inferno that 
              consumed the uppermost buffalo jump deposit, Bone Bed 3, leaving 
              behind the thick layer of charred and calcined bone that first drew 
              archeologists to the site. Bone Bed 3 was thickest against the talus 
              cone at the south end of the shelter and gradually became thinner 
              toward the back and north end. Some of the bones in the thinner 
              outer edges of the deposit are not burned, showing that the fire 
              was concentrated in the main heap of bones. Within Bone Bed 3 were 
              the mostly burned and jumbled bones of an estimated 800 bison, mostly 
              cows (females) and yearling calves. The radiocarbon evidence and 
              broad triangular dart points date Bone Bed 3 to approximately 800 
              B.C. or about 2800 years ago, during the Late Archaic period. A 
              number of topics and questions about Bone Bed 3 continue to be debated.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Is Bone Bed 3 the result of a single jump?</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">It is uncertain whether Bone Bed 3 represents a single 
              jump or several jumps closely spaced in time. Faunal analyst Dessamae 
              Lorrain argued for only a single event, based on her finding that 
              most of the animals were females and yearlings. In her opinion, 
              such uniformity was unlikely to have occurred more than once. Most 
              other experts who have weighed in on the matter disagree. Dave Dibble 
              stated that &quot;in view of the large number of animals present, 
              the second alternative [multiple events] seems more logical.&quot; 
              But he respected Lorrain's argument and acknowledged that no stratigraphic 
              evidence of separate deposits was found. He did point out that the 
              radiocarbon dates show that the upper deposits in Bonfire Shelter 
              accumulated very slowly. Thus, if Bone Bed 3 did result from two 
              or more jump events separated by relatively short periods of time 
              (a few years or even several decades), the bones would have remained 
              exposed between events and little or no discernable evidence would 
              remain of the elapsed time. In other words, there would be no visible 
              separation between the bones, such as a layer of dust, silt, rockfall, 
              or other materials that, over time, tend to cover a site's surface, 
              and that would indicate to archeologists a time lapse from one event 
              to the next. The stratigraphic evidence was also impacted by the 
              horrific fire that consumed the bones, but there were no obvious 
              internal layers within Bone Bed 3 such as those found in Bone Bed 
              2.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Lumpers vs. Splitters</b> </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Archeologist Elton Prewitt believes that the stylistic 
              variation among the Bone Bed 3 dart points also suggests there may 
              have been several jump episodes separated by hundreds of years. 
              The broad-bladed triangular dart points found amid the buffalo bones 
              include 3 <a href="images/Montell-Lot514.html" target="_blank" class="text">Montell 
              points</a>, 2 <a href="images/VV218-C341.html" target="_blank" class="text">side-notched 
              points</a>, an odd, stemmed point (probably a knife), and 19 basal- 
              or <a href="images/mb8.html" target="_blank" class="text">corner-notched 
              points</a> that Dibble classified as &quot;Castroville-like.&quot; 
              He saw these 19 as variations on a single theme, but noted that 
              among the variants were specimens that could be assigned to the 
              Marcos, Marshall, Shumla, and Williams types. The stylistic attributes 
              shared by these projectile point types have been noted by many archeologists 
              working in central and southwestern Texas. This brings up an interesting 
              question: what does the presence of so many similar but slightly 
              different projectile points mean in terms of human behavior?</p>
            <p class="text">This question has been much debated by archeologists, 
              and no one answer reigns. Some archeologists are typological &quot;splitters&quot; 
              and tend to separate projectile points into different variations 
              and types based on rather minor differences. At the other end of 
              the spectrum are the &quot;lumpers&quot; who prefer to see broad 
              patterns and allow for a fair amount of variation within a named 
              point type. In the mid-twentieth century, the idea that a single 
              group of people (a tribe or band) would have used a single type 
              of projectile point at any one time was popular: one point type 
              = one group of people. But few archeologists would accept this idea 
              today because there are many examples of different types found with 
              (or in) a single burial or cache of artifacts, behavioral episodes 
              that most likely represent the actions of a few closely related 
              people at a single moment in time. </p>
            <p class="text">From a splitter's perspective, there are many different 
              types of points in Bone Bed 3, making it unlikely that all were 
              in use by a single group (or several related and cooperating groups) 
              at a single point in time. But a lumper, such as this writer (Black) 
              and Dave Dibble in the present case, would not accept this argument. 
              If indeed a single massive drive or several closely spaced large 
              drives was responsible for Bone Bed 3, then we would assume that 
              a fairly large group of people must have been involved - dozens 
              perhaps even hundreds. Since most of the hunter-gatherer bands that 
              were recorded in the general vicinity by the earliest Spanish explorers 
              and missionaries were relatively small bands of less than 50 people, 
              it might be assumed that several different bands participated in 
              the prehistoric buffalo drives. Following this logic, the stylistic 
              variation among the Late Archaic dart points in Bone Bed 3 could 
              plausibly represent a single moment or short period of time.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>How many bison can fit into Bonfire Shelter?</b></li>
            </ul>
             
            <p class="text">Archeologist Mike Collins and paleontologist Ernest 
              Lundelius once sat down and tried to calculate the volume that 800 
              buffalo would represent in cubic feet. Mike used his firsthand experience 
              trying to load yearling cattle into cattle trailers and haul them 
              off to market and figured out how many trailers it would take to 
              hold 800 yearlings. Keep in mind that buffalo are bigger than cattle 
              and that there were adult female buffalo along with the yearlings 
              in Bone Bed 3. Neither Collins nor Lundelius kept the cocktail napkin 
              upon which the calculations were made, but both are convinced that 
              it would have been physically impossible for 800 buffalo, even small 
              ones, to fit inside Bonfire Shelter, even assuming they filled the 
              entire cavity. </p>
            <p class="text">This leaves us with two possibilities: if the 800-animal 
              estimate is more or less accurate, then this number plainly represents 

              multiple jumps. Lundelius points out that if the jumps took place 
              at the same time of the year (late winter or early spring), then 
              the herd structure may well have been similar from jump to jump 
              (contrary to Lorrain's assumption). The second possibility is that 
              the 800-animal estimate is wrong and that far fewer animals are 
              represented. But even if we assume that there were only half that 
              many, 400 buffalo is still a huge amount. Assuming that a yearling 
              weighs roughly 700 pounds, that is over a quarter of a million pounds 
              of dead and dying animals, an awesome figure.</p>
            <p class="text">The view favored here is that Bone Bed 3 is most likely 
              the result of multiple jump episodes that occurred within a relatively 
              short time span, a few decades to a few hundred years at most. But 
              this is only an educated guess. This question is one of many lingering 
              problems that could be solved in the future with new analytical 
              techniques. </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>The Bone Bed 3 artifacts are few. </b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">The artifacts found amid the burned bones include 
              38 dart points and fragments thereof (not counting the individual 
              pieces of those that could be refitted), a bifacial knife, a side 
              scraper, 2 hammerstones, a scratched pebble, 6 flake tools, and 
              22 unworked flakes. It is likely that some of the dart points were 
              actually used as knives, as often is found to be the case when use-wear 
              studies (microscopic examination of scars, polish, and other indicators 
              of use) are done of projectile points. Even so, the tool inventory 
              is rather sparse given the chore of butchering hundreds of bison. 
              As was the case in both of the lower bone beds at the site, several 
              large basketball-sized rocks were found amid the Bone Bed 3 bones. 
              These were probably used as anvils to break apart bones and perhaps 
              to dispatch wounded bison.</p>
