	<p class="text">The deepest and oldest layers in Bonfire Shelter containing 
              animal bones are known collectively as Bone Bed 1 and are present 
              only in the central part of the shelter. Together the Bone Bed 1 
              layers are 20-24 inches (50-60 cm) thick and begin directly below 
              Bone Bed 2 at a depth of 6.5 ft (2.2 m) below the shelter's modern 
              surface). There is only a single radiocarbon date from Bone Bed 
              1, and it establishes a minimum age of 11,500 B.C. Most likely Bone 
              Bed 1 is several thousand years older. Several facts about Bone 
              Bed 1 are remarkable. </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Almost all of the identified bones are from 
                extinct animal species.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">These include wooly (Mammuthus sp.), camel (Camelops 
              hesternus), at least one species of horse (Equus francisci), a small 
              antelope (Capromeryx sp.), and bison (Bison antiquus or occidentalis). 
              All of these animals disappeared from Earth at the end of the last 
              Ice Age (the Pleistocene) before 9,000 B.C. Although it is unlikely 
              that humans alone were responsible for the Late Pleistocene extinctions 
              in North America, they almost certainly contributed to the wave 
              of extinctions brought on by major climatic changes. </p>
            <p class="text">Drawings of many of the Ice-Age animals whose bones 
              were found in Bone Bed 1 at Bonfire help us visualize the environment 
              that early human groups in the region would have encountered. The 
              bison, Ice-Age and modern, that were killed at Bonfire probably 
              spent most of their lives on the southern Plains to the north.</p>
            <p class="text">Only one bone found in the uppermost layer of Bone 
              Bed 1 is of a species that survives today, the gray fox (Urocyon 
              cinereoargenteus). The species list given here does not include 
              any of the small animals (rats and such) present in the sediment 
              samples collected as microfauna samples; these have yet to be fully 
              analyzed. </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Bone Bed 1 consists of at least five bone-bearing 
                layers.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">Of the five bone-bearing layers now known (Strata 
              D, E, H-1, H-2, and I), several are very thin and do not extend 
              across the entire excavated area in the center of the shelter. It 
              is likely that if the excavation area is ever expanded in the future, 
              other minor layers will be found within Bonfire's lower deposits. 
              Stratum D contains only the gray fox bone and Stratum H-2, only 
              three antelope bones. The other three layers have multiple species 
              and are considered by Bement to represent separate bone beds. These 
              are discussed below. </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>The bones were introduced into the shelter by 
                predators, but not necessarily humans.</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">By the time Bone Bed 1 began forming, perhaps between 
              12,000-14,000 B.C., the floor of Bonfire Shelter was already high 
              and dry above the down-cutting canyon floor (although probably not 
              by much). Lacking any evidence of stream deposits that might have 
              washed bones into the shelter, there is no other credible alternative 
              to explain the presence of splintered and broken bones from a variety 
              of animals, many quite large. Predators carried or dragged dead 
              animals or body parts into the shelter or else they trapped animals 
              in the cave and killed them there. But which predators? The most 
              likely candidates include humans and three now-extinct carnivores: 
              the short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), a sabertoothed cat known 
              as scimitar cat (Homotherium serum), and wolf, possibly the dire 
              wolf (Canus dirus) or gray wolf (Canus lupins). Although lacking 
              definite proof such as the presence of stone tools or hearths, the 
              Bonfire investigators have argued that humans were the chief Bone 
              Bed 1 predator. See <a href="talkingbones.html#bb1predators" class="text"> 
              Who were the Bone Bed 1 Predators?</a> for a summary of the arguments 
              and evidence.</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text"><b>Bone Bed 1, unlike the later bone beds, did 
                not form as the result of &quot;jumps.&quot;</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">The jump explanation can be rejected for two reasons. 
              One is that Bone Bed 1 is concentrated in the central, interior 
              part of Bonfire Shelter and is not present at the south end adjacent 
              to the talus cone where both of the upper bone beds are concentrated. 
              Secondly, there are multiple species present in Bone Bed 1 including 
              species that are poor candidates for having been driven over cliffs. 
              Mammoths were extremely large creatures that, based on what is known 
              about their modern elephant cousins, were highly intelligent and 
              wary. They lived in smaller social groups (families) and were not 
              as prone to bolt and run pell-mell as bison. Camels, horses, and 
              antelope are all fleet-footed animals that should have been able 
              to evade small groups of hunters upon the rolling grassy plains 
              that probably covered the uplands above Bonfire Shelter in the Late 
              Pleistocene. There is no definitive evidence that any of these species 
              were killed by the jump method anywhere in North America. See <a href="talkingbones.html#bb1predators" class="text">Who 
              were the Bone Bed 1 Predators?</a> for an alternative explanation.<br>

           <h3><a name="layers"></a>The Bone Bed 1 Layers</h3>
            <p class="text">Three of the layers in Bone Bed 1 (Stratum E, H-1, 
              and I) could and probably should be considered as separate bone 
              accumulations (i.e., bone beds) on their own merits. All three probably 
              formed in a relatively short time and contained numerous large bones 
              of at least two different creatures. All three also had what Bement 
              believes is a highly significant pattern: the presence of limestone 
              blocks lying in association with splintered and broken long bones.</p>
			<div align="center"><img src="images/bb1bone.gif" alt="Picture of bone" width="89" height="32"></div>
            <h3><a name="e"></a>Stratum E Bone Bed</h3>
            <p class="text">Stratum E contained the remains of at least three 
              horses (mostly juveniles), a camel, a bison, and a mammoth. Bones 
              from all four species were found close together and in apparent 
              association with one large limestone block (somewhat larger than 
              a basketball) and several smaller ones. Most of these bones were 
              hind- and front-leg bones of horse, bison, and camel. Not far away 
              were several other clusters of smaller limestone blocks and splintered 
              bone.</p>
			<div align="center"><img src="images/bb1bone.gif" alt="Picture of bone" width="89" height="32"></div>
            <h3><a name="h"></a>Stratum H-1 Bone Bed</h3>
            <p class="text">Stratum H-1 contained bones from at least two horses 
              and a young mammoth. The horse bones were by far the most numerous. 
              One horse was a mature adult (at least 3.5 years old) and one was 
              a colt, less than a year old, based on dental eruption patterns 
              and fusing of certain bones. The range of bone elements present, 
              leg and feet bones, skull and teeth fragments, and various vertebrae, 
              suggest that the entire carcass was once in the shelter. The mammoth 
              was less well represented, but the presence of mandible fragments, 
              a vertebra, and fragments of the pelvis, tibia (upper front leg), 
              and a rib, suggests that much of the animal was in the shelter. 
              Once again there were several clusters of limestone blocks and broken 
              bones. The most impressive was a line of five limestone rocks, two 
              of which were directly associated with fragmented horse bones including 
              the ends of two ulnas (lower front legs) and one sacrum (tail bone) 
              broken along its center line.</p>
			<div align="center"><img src="images/bb1bone.gif" alt="Picture of bone" width="89" height="32"></div>
            <h3><a name="1"></a>Stratum I Bone Bed</h3>
            <p class="text">This layer contained bones from a large bison and 
              the teeth from at least one adult horse. The bison was represented 
              by a variety of post-cranial (everything below the head) elements 
              including vertebra, leg bones, foot bones, ribs, shoulder, and pelvis. 
              Three large boulders dominated the bone bed, but these rested on 
              lower layers and thus pre-date Stratum I. Seven smaller but still 
              hefty limestone blocks were found amid fractured bison bones. In 
              another area of the deposit, a separate limestone block was found 
              alongside more fragmented bison bones and several horse teeth. </p>
