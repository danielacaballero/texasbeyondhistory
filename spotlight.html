            <p class="text">Caches and burials  connect us in a very personal way to past events and the traditions of ancient cultures.  In 1936, archeologists�from The University of Texas working in the arid Lower Pecos canyonlands of southwest Texas uncovered what they described as �a find of unusual interest�: a twined-fiber bag, filled with an array of objects, and still securely fastened after more than 4000 years. Recent studies  of this TARL collection, including technical analyses of  stone and bone tools and radiocarbon assays of plant remains, are helping to unlock some of its secrets. More than 80 years  after its discovery, we are featuring this  rare and little-known  collection on TBH and rethinking its significance and meaning.</p>

            <p class="text">Patterns in the shape and technology of stone tools  can provide evidence of past human behavior, technology, movement, and the flow of goods or ideas across a landscape. Today, many anthropological research studies featuring shape analysis of materials, ranging from pottery vessels to <em>Australopithecine</em> and early<em> Homo</em> crania, use a method known as Geometric Morphometrics. Archeologist and Associate Editor of <em>Texas Beyond History,</em> Heather Smith, discusses the Geometric Morphometric method and her use of this approach in her research  on the human occupation of the American continents at the end of the last Ice Age.</p>

            <p class="text">A set of Plains Indian ledger drawings continues to mystify researchers more than 50 years after its acquisition by The University of Texas. Much of what is known about the Schild Ledger Book raises questions&mdash;from  the identity and tribal affiliation of the artists who created the  drawings to the circumstances of the book coming into the possession of a family in Germany.&nbsp; Recording a way of life as it passed into history, these colorful and often complex depictions of  battles,  buffalo hunts, heroic deeds, and traditional customs have been variously ascribed to the Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Comanche. In this section, we examine questions surrounding the book and provide an online gallery of prime examples from this collection at TARL.</p>

            <p class="text">A wealth of information about past environments and prehistoric human behavior can   be gleaned by studying  these seemingly inconsequential mollusks. TARL researcher Ken Brown leads us through the painstaking but fascinating proccesess involved in their study and explains  their value as indicators of   past climatic conditions  and prehistoric dietary habits. </p>

            <p class="text">Using a high-powered microscope and a special reference collection of replicated  stone  tools, TARL analyst Marilyn Schoberg studies microwear patterns on ancient tools to try to determine   how they might have   been used and on what materials. In some cases, tools were not used in ways we would expect,  based on morphology alone, but hold a complex&#8212;and sometimes unexpected&#8212;history of use. This feature describes some of the processes involved in the analysis and some of her more interesting findings.</p>
