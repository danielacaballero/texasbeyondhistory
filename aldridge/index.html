                    a few ruined buildings&#151;their concrete walls overgrown, 
                    crumbling, and splotched with graffiti&#151;and a maze of 
                    stone foundations near a pond are all that remain of what 
                    was once Aldridge, a bustling sawmill and neatly laid-out 
                    company town. It is hard to imagine that less than a century 
                    ago in these quiet woods, steam and sawdust once filled the 
                    air. Shouts of mill workers competed with the metallic din 
                    of machinery and the blaring whistles of trains hauling lumber 
                    to far-away markets. Forest crews&#151;the choppers, flatheads, 
                    and buckers who harvested the enormous pines from woods nearby&#151;came 
                    to town on occasion, joining the sawyers, trimmers, planers, 
                    managers, merchants, teachers, preachers, and their families 
                    who made up the Aldridge populace. </p>
                  <p class="text">Like many other early lumber factories in this 
                    richly resourced region, Aldridge was a temporary phenomenon, 
                    a mill complex and community created to serve a single purpose&#151;to 
                    extract and process timber resources. Sawmills were built, 
                    forests harvested, and communities reduced to ghost towns 
                    within the sweep of half a century or less. Yet, during its 
                    brief heyday, the Aldridge sawmill produced thousands of board 
                    feet of yellow pine lumber a day and supported hundreds of 
                    workers and their families. Collectively, Aldridge and the 
                    many East Texas sawmills like it played a significant role 
                    in the American economy&#151;providing the lumber needed to 
                    build the towns and cities across Texas and other parts of 
                    the nation.</p>
                  <p class="text">The &quot;Bonanza&quot; period of East Texas 
                    logging began in the late 1880s and lasted until the late 
                    1920s. Well before this time, national population growth and 
                    industrial development had exhausted the last remaining forests 
                    in the northern United States and created a huge demand for 
                    southern lumber and other timber products. The largely untapped 
                    timber potential of East Texas attracted new investment capital 
                    to finance larger, more powerful logging operations.</p>
                  <p class="text">Timber production shifted from the small, relatively 
                    primitive, owner-operated sawmills of the mid-19th century 
                    to more industrialized, technologically sophisticated operations 
                    employing hundreds of people. The new operators, some of them 
                    corporations, came to dominate the East Texas economy in the 
                    early 20th century. They built their own railroads into the 
                    forests, connecting their remote sawmills and &quot;company 
                    towns&quot; with shipping points for their timber products.</p>
                  <p class="text">An estimated 615 sawmills were operating in 
                    Texas in 1910, according to the <em>Texas Almanac</i>. The 
                    impact of this activity was dramatic. Approximately 18 million 
                    acres worth of &quot;Pineywoods&quot; timber was cut during 
                    the 50 years between 1880 and 1930, an amount estimated to 
                    represent <em>59 billion board feet of lumber</i>. Most of 
                    the pristine pine forests were cut out within a few decades. 
                    Depletion of the state's timber resources, combined with the 
                    impact of the Great Depression, brought an end to the &quot;Bonanza&quot; 
                    period. Some of the large timber companies moved their operations 
                    to the forests of the Pacific Northwest, while others went 
                    into bankruptcy.</p>
                  <p class="text">Federal legislation authorized the purchase 
                    of cut-over timber lands, and in the 1930s, the U.S. Forest 
                    Service began to appraise and purchase such lands in East 
                    Texas. These include what are now the Angelina National Forest, 
                    Davy Crockett National Forest, Sabine National Forest, and 
                    Sam Houston National Forest. Over the past 70 years, the Forest 
                    Service has replanted these lands and replenished the East 
                    Texas timber reserves, implemented sustained yield practices, 
                    and instituted programs to conserve the soil, water, and other 
                    natural resources of the region.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Aldridge Sawmill, which operated between 
                    1905 and 1923, was capable of producing 125,000 board feet 
                    of lumber per day, making it a large operation for its time. 
                    But, plagued by fires and eventually the depletion of nearby 
                    timber resources, the Aldridge operation was abandoned. Over 
                    time, its houses and factory buildings were picked over, some 
                    torn down for usable construction materials and machinery, 
                    others left to slowly succumb to the forces of nature. Today, 
                    the site continues to be threatened by vandals and treasure 
                    seekers. </p>
                  <p class="text">Located within the boundaries of the modern 
                    Angelina National Forest, the Aldridge Sawmill and Township

                    and capital investment that opened the Pineywoods to economic 
                    development in the early 20th century. As one of the few sites

                          Through the efforts of staff archeologists 
                          and volunteers, historic forest sites 
                          are documented and investigated, helping 
                          to preserve the forest legacy and increase 
                          public awareness. Photo courtesy USDA
