                  <p class="text">The pine forest lands or &quot;Pineywoods&quot; 
                    of East Texas extend from the Red River in the northeast corner 
                    of the state, southward to the region bordering Galveston 
                    Bay, and from the Louisiana border on the east to the Black 
                    Prairie region on the west. As shown in the maps below, this 
                    area includes all or portions of 44 Texas counties. </p>
                  <p class="text">Although there are a few isolated pockets in 
                    other parts of the state (the woods at Bastrop State Park 
                    in Central Texas and in the far western Trans-Pecos regions 
                    being notable examples), Texas pine forests are contained 
                    in the eastern part of the state because of favorable soil 
                    conditions. Bordering the Pineywoods on the west is a band 
                    of hardwood forest commonly referred to as the Post Oak Belt. 
                    Outside this belt is the first true grassland, known as the 
                    Black Prairie, characterized by a deep black lime-rich soil 
                    over limestone and marl, a combination of soil and substrate 
                    that deters the encroachment of pine into the area. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Pineywoods region encompasses the four National 
                    Forests in Texas: the Angelina, Davy Crockett, Sabine, and 
                    Sam Houston. Together these four forests cover a total of 
                    637,386 acres in south and central East Texas, and include 
                    portions of Angelina, Houston, Jasper, Montgomery, Nacogdoches, 
                    Newton, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, 
                    and Walker counties.</p>
                  <p class="text">The topography in East Texas is gently rolling 
                    to hilly in the north and central areas, becoming flatter 
                    near the Gulf of Mexico. It is a well-watered area and contains 
                    the Angelina, Neches, Sabine, and Trinity rivers as well as 
                    many creeks and bayous. This varied terrain&#151;from dry 
                    to moist uplands, to creek and riverbottoms, to swamp forest 
                    communities&#151;produces quite different groupings of vegetation. 
                    In their illustrated 1985 volume, <em>Trees, Shrubs, and Woody 
                    Vines of East Texas</i>, Elray Nixon and Bruce Cunningham 
                    organize the vegetation of East Texas into plant communities 
                    based on terrain, soil, and moisture conditions. These are 
                    described below.</p>
                  <p class="text">Hardwoods tend to be dominant in the <b>dry 
                    upland areas</b>, where the soil is sandy and well drained.

                    are among the most common species. Pines also grow with some 
                    frequency in this area, with shortleaf (<em>Pinus echinata</i>) 
                    found in the north and central areas and longleaf (<em>P. palustris</i>) 
                    in the southeast. Other trees are sweetgum (<em>Liquidamber 
                    styraciflua</i>), red mulberry (<em>Morus rubra</i>), woollybucket 
                    bumelia (<em>Bumelia lanuginosa</i>), southern red oak (Q.falcata),

                  <p class="text">Loblolly pines (<em>Pinus taeda</i>) are found 
                    in the more <b>moist upland areas</b> where the soil retains 
                    more water throughout the year. Other trees growing in this 
                    area are southern red oak, sweetgum, winged elm, water oak

                  <p class="text">The well-drained, fertile soils of the creek 
                    and river bottoms, (the <b>mesic bottomlands</b>) produce 
                    dense stands of trees and shrubs. Overstory vegetation (taller 
                    trees growing above smaller varieties, shrubs, and vines) 
                    includes red maple (<em>Acer rubrum</i>), white oak (<em>Quercus

                  <p class="text">Four species of pine timber found in East Texas 
                    are harvested commercially: longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, 
                    loblolly pine, and slash pine. Of these, the first three are 
                    native species, and the fourth, slash pine, is an exotic (non-native) 
                    type. Slash pine is a southeastern species, found primarily 
                    east of the Mississippi River. It was planted in East Texas 
                    in the 1930's by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) as 
                    part of a large forest regeneration effort. Although it is 
                    harvested commercially today, slash pine was not present during 
                    the Bonanza period of the East Texas logging industry. </p>
                  <p class="text">Longleaf pine has commonly been 
                    referred to as longstraw, yellow, southern 
                    yellow, swamp, hard or heart, pitch, and Georgia 
                    pine. It is estimated that longleaf pine once 
                    covered as much as 5,000 square miles in Texas. 
                    The species develops best in association with 
                    periodic surface fires which result in open 
                    parklike stands. Although longleaf will thrive 
                    under a wide variety of conditions, in East 
                    Texas this species was primarily located on 
                    well-drained sandy ridges of the south-central 
                    part of the region. Mature longleaf pine trees 
                    produce a large amount of high quality resin 
                    which made them an important resource for 
                    the naval stores (turpentine and resin) industry. 
                    Their lumber is of a high quality and is well 
                    suited for a variety of uses, including poles, 
                    posts, sawlogs, plywood, and pulpwood.</p>
                  <p class="text">Shortleaf pine is also referred 
                    to as shortleaf yellow, southern yellow, oldfield, 
                    shortstraw, or Arkansas soft pine. It grows 
                    well under a variety of soil and site conditions, 
                    and has the widest range of any pine species 
                    in the southern United States. In Texas, its 
                    range is primarily in the northern part of 
                    the timber region, and covers approximately 
                    30,000 square miles extending from the Red 
                    River in the north to the edge of the longleaf 
                    range in the south-central part of the region. 
                    Shortleaf pine was the first of the Texas 
                    pines to be exploited commercially due to 
                    the early expansion of the railroads into 
                    its range. It is most commonly used for the 
                    production of lumber, plywood, and other structural 
                    materials. It is also used for pulpwood, and 
                    in some cases even the taproot may be used 
                    for pulp.</p>
                  <p class="text">Loblolly pine, sometimes referred 
                    to as Arkansas, Carolina, or oldfield pine, 
                    originally covered an estimated area of about 
                    7,000 square miles in Texas. Its range was 
                    originally south and west of the longleaf 
                    area, and included all or parts of San Jacinto, 
                    Walker, Montgomery, Harris, Jefferson, Liberty, 
                    Orange, Harden, Grimes, Newton, Jasper, and 
                    Chambers counties. Because it has excellent 
                    reproductive characteristics including rapid 
                    juvenile growth, much of the current &quot;second-growth&quot; 
                    pine forest of southern and central East Texas 
                    is loblolly. Loblolly is used for lumber, 
                    and makes excellent habitat for both game 
                    and non-game species.</p><br/>
