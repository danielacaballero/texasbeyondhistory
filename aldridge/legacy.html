                          age: 102 1/2</p>
                        <p><em>Mittie was born in 1894, in Angelina County, Texas. 
                          She had 5 brothers and sisters, most of whom died early 
                          on of pneumonia. She recalled that Aldridge had &quot;nice 
                          houses and a nice big school,&quot; with many children 
                          going to it. Everyone around worked in the mill, whites 
                          and blacks together. &quot;There was a big kitchen at 
                          Aldridge where you could buy dinner&quot; (the noon 
                          meal). They also had a doctor's office, drug store, 
                          barber shop, and a kitchen&#151;&quot;a big, long house 
                          with big, long tables and benches on each side.&quot; 
                          The main cook was a man, and about 10 women worked with 
                          him there from daylight until dark. According to Mittie, 
                          she didn't ask to work in the kitchen; they &quot;just 
                          came and got her.&quot; Someone had told them she could 
                          cook. <br>
                          Mittie's husband Jess was a carpenter who worked outside 
                          the mill. He made furniture and also worked at the blacksmith 
                          shop. Jess played the fiddle for the dances at Aldridge 
                          and other places, and Mittie liked to dance. They were 
                          married in May, 1918. Jess died in 1940 at age 50, from 
                          pneumonia.</i><br>

                    have long been aware of the slow cycle of destruction occurring 
                    at the Aldridge Sawmill site. Hidden deep in the Angelina 
                    forest, the high-walled ruins are a magnet for &quot;artists&quot; 
                    wielding spray-paint cans and artifact hunters seeking items 
                    left behind by millworkers and townspeople nearly a century 
                    ago. Nature has taken its toll as well; vines crawl over the 
                    porous concrete walls, and shrubs and trees have invaded the 
                    building interiors. </p>

                    over a decade, although lack of funding and manpower continues 
                    to slow progress. Volunteer efforts have helped turn the tide. 
                    During a two-week period in 1995 and 1996, the USDA Forest 
                    Service, National Forests and Grasslands of Texas, hosted 
                    a <em>Passport In Time </i>(PIT) project focusing on the Aldridge 
                    Sawmill and Township. Volunteers from across the United States 
                    came to help with the investigations at the site. During that 
                    time, visitors coming to view the ruins told of their family 
                    members who had lived or worked at Aldridge. </p>

                    it appeared in the past and as it appears 
                    to visitors today&#151;is based on information 
                    collected from these efforts as well as historical

                  <h3>Boom and Bust</h3>
                  <p class="text">Hal Aldridge was a young entrepreneur 
                    from Rockland, Texas, where he first gained 
                    experience as a sawmill owner and operator. 
                    He bought the Rockland sawmill in 1890, and 
                    as this mill prospered, he began to purchase 
                    lands with &quot;high quality&quot; timber 
                    (undoubtedly longleaf pine) in Angelina and 
                    Jasper counties. With a vision of building 
                    a mill closer to his new timberland holdings, 
                    Aldridge sold the Rockland Sawmill in 1898. 
                    He chose the site for his new mill carefully, 
                    locating it on the east bank of the Neches 
                    River at a bend downstream from what was once 
                    known as Boon's Ferry crossing. </p>
                  <p class="text">At that time, the river-bend site already had 
                    a logging history. Since the 1840s, it apparently had been 
                    a gathering and shipment point for rafting logs down the Neches 
                    River to the coastal city of Beaumont. The river would continue 
                    to be an important factor in the new sawmill&#151;the water 
                    was used for boilers, train engines, and for fighting fires. 
                    The river channel provided transportation and storage space: 
                    logs were floated downstream, and log booms could be set up 
                    to store logs for future production. There were two other 
                    important resources to be exploited in this area; the lumber 
                    produced from the pines and the rocks from the nearby quarries. 
                    After the great hurricane nearly destroyed Galveston in the 
                    early 1900's, rock from the quarry near Aldridge was used 
                    to build the long barrier jetty.</p>
                  <p class="text">Another critical factor was veteran lumberman 
                    John H. Kirby's plan to build an east-west railroad to the 
                    site of Aldridge Mill. As a landowner in the area, Kirby had 
                    an eye on future business development. By building the Burrs 
                    Ferry, Browndell and Chester Railroad (BFB&amp;C), he could 
                    ensure that products would reach their markets.</p>
                  <p class="text">Hal Aldridge, however, did not 
                    wait for the railroad to be built. He began 
                    building the wooden sawmill in 1903, completing 
                    construction by 1905. A Herculean effort then 
                    ensued to outfit the remote site: hundreds 
                    of men and tons of machinery were brought 
                    in. Four massive boilers were hauled by oxcarts 
                    with huge wooden wheels through the forests 
                    to the Aldridge Mill. Concurrently, work proceeded 
                    on building the railroad. By 1906, the BFB&amp;C 
                    Railroad extended to the rock quarries just 
                    northwest of Aldridge and, a year later, finally 
                    reached the sawmill. This 11-mile tram line 
                    ran from Rockland, to Aldridge, to the Neches 
                    river.</p>
                  <p class="text">The sawmill enterprise at Aldridge got underway 
                    successfully, with production reaching 75,000 board feet of 
                    lumber daily. But the wooden mill buildings were crowded, 
                    unsafe, and proved to be a fire hazard. On August 25, 1911, 
                    the mill burned to the ground. </p>
                  <p class="text">At this time, the Aldridge mill was the only 
                    sawmill operating in the vast timber region. Other mills had 
                    already closed, and the decision to rebuild seemed a wise 
                    business strategy. To ensure greater safety and avoid increased 
                    insurance rates, the layout of the mill was changed to provide 
                    adequate spacing between the buildings. By 1912, the mill 
                    had been rebuilt, with buildings to house the engine, boiler, 
                    fuel room, and dry kiln constructed primarily of concrete 
                    reinforced with iron beams and furnished with state-of-the-art 
                    machinery, including a single-cutting band saw and a resaw. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">With the new improvements, the Aldridge Lumber 
                    Company once again saw success. In a short time, the mill 
                    was producing 125,000 feet of lumber a day. Hal Aldridge employed 
                    500 workers, some harvesting timber in the woods, others working 
                    at the mill&#151;the largest roster of any lumber company 
                    at the time. And as the mill rose from the ashes, so did the 
                    town. By 1913, some 1000-1500 folks lived in 200 company houses 
                    in the quiet, neatly arranged community of Aldridge. </p>
                  <p class="text">Segregation in towns and cities was common, 
                    and Aldridge and other sawmill communities were no exception 
                    even though black and white workers often worked side-by-side 
                    in the woods. Accommodations in both the &quot;colored&quot; 
                    area (the area reserved for African Americans) and &quot;white&quot; 
                    area were described as simple frame houses with wide front 
                    porches. (Mill owner Hal Aldridge, however, built what is 
                    described as a rather &quot;palatial mansion&quot; for himself.) 
                    Although some descendants of former residents recall that 
                    homes rented to white workers were somewhat nicer than those 
                    for blacks, no one interviewed recalled racial tension or 
                    labor disputes in the small community. </p>
                  <p class="text">A central focus of the town was the company 
                    commissary, where workers could purchase food and furnishings 
                    with discount tokens provided by the mill. There was also 
                    20-room hotel for travelers, a post office, blacksmith shop, 
                    train depot, two schools, shops, saloons, and other typical 
                    enterprises found in small towns. A large community vegetable 
                    garden provided free produce for the workers.</p>
                  <p class="text">But success and prosperity at Aldridge again 
                    were to be fleeting. On October 22, 1914, the mill was struck 
                    by an arsonist. Twice hit by misfortune, Hal Aldridge elected 
                    to quit the lumber business and move to EI Paso, leaving his 
                    operation in care of company Vice President F. W. Aldridge 
                    (assumed to be Hal Aldridge's brother.) Fortunately, the October 
                    22 fire had been discovered shortly after it started, and 
                    only minimal damage was done. Nonetheless, business at the 
                    mill began trending downward, most likely due to the depletion 
                    of the pine forest in the area. And in 1919, yet another fire 
                    delivered the final death blow to Aldridge. <br>
                    <br>
                    By 1920, the town of Aldridge was nearly abandoned. Kirby 
                    Lumber Company eventually bought the mill, and a few loyal 
                    and faithful Kirby employees kept the mill operating. During 
                    the next decade, they built houses using wood from the mill 
                    houses, fenced the living areas, and farmed the land, according 
                    to 1990s interviews with residents. But in 1927, the railroad 
                    spur from nearby Rockland to Turpentine was closed, further 
                    blighting efforts to rekindle enterprise at Aldridge. The 
                    U. S. Forest Service eventually took possession of the property, 
                    and it was annexed into the Angelina National Forest.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1941, the Forest Service replanted the area 
                    immediately next to the sawmill. In subsequent years, staff 
                    have taken measures to document the historic site, replant 
                    trees, and manage and abate insect infestations (the general 
                    practice was to cut and leave on the ground those pine trees 
                    infested with the southern pine beetle). The pine forest to 
                    the north of the sawmill, where the &quot;white&quot; residences 
                    were, was cut a second time, and the land is currently producing 
                    a third (historically) generation of pine. The last planting 
                    took place in 1984, and the resulting pine plantation is nearly 
                    impenetrable. </p>

                        <p><em>R.Z was born in 1917 in Aldridge Sawmill Town. He 
                          recalls that he and his family lived in a frame board 
                          and batten house with four rooms, a wood heater, and 
                          a front porch. The houses were fairly close together, 
                          and there was a well between every second house and 
                          the next. They had &quot;colored&quot; quarters and 
                          white quarters. For Fourth of July at Aldridge, they 
                          would spend the week before fishing in the river, and 
                          kept the fish alive in a box in the water. Then they 
                          would have a big fish fry behind grandpa's house on 
                          the river. His grandpa once caught a 49-pound cat fish 
                          with clabber milk for bait, tied up in a rag in a net.</i>

                    has sat dormant for decades. The remains include 
                    four massive concrete structures that held 
                    the boiler room, engine room, fuel room and 
                    the drying kiln. Nearby is what was once the 
                    sawmill pond. There is no sign of residential 
                    structures, school, churches, commissary or 
                    the hotel. When the mill closed down, the 
                    houses were sold and removed as salvage. Only 
                    second-growth timber now stands where a community 
                    once thrived. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Aldridge Mill and Township were recorded 
                    by Forest Archeologist John Ippolito in 1979 as part of a 
                    general heritage inventory of the National Forest Lands and 
                    to begin the National Register of Historic Places evaluation. 
                    In 1989, forest service archeologists mapped and surveyed 
                    the site. In spite of increased attention, the site has not 
                    escaped vandalism, graffiti, and the effects of metal detector 
                    enthusiasts searching for artifacts. </p>
                  <p class="text">One recent offense prompted the U. S. Forest 
                    Service archeological staff to begin an in-depth study of 
                    the damage that has been done and to recover some of the artifacts 
                    which were taken from the site. For example, numerous tokens 
                    (the form of payment from the mill owner to the worker) have 
                    been recovered through investigations of such incidents. These 
                    &quot;punch outs&quot; could be used at the commissary or 
                    redeemed elsewhere at a 10 to 20 per cent discount. Staff 
                    have also tested various chemical compounds to remove the 
                    graffiti on the structural ruins, but with only mixed results.</p>
                  <p class="text">Volunteers with the PIT project helped Ippolito 
                    and then-assistant forest archeologist Velicia Bergstrom assess 
                    site destruction, both human and natural, and document what 
                    remained of the mill and community. Some helped with initial 
                    archeological testing in residential sections of the townsite 
                    as well as industrial areas, while others tested the terrace 
                    of the nearby Neches River. A third group surveyed the area 
                    to establish the site perimeters. Volunteers compared the 
                    1911 map and more-recent site map, then swept the area with 
                    metal detectors to establish probable areas of interest. They 
                    dug shovel tests in various areas to learn more about the 
                    structures that once stood there and their functions, based 
                    on artifacts or other evidence. (The area where the &quot;white&quot; 
                    residences were located is currently in a young pine plantation, 
                    so testing could not been done there.) A volunteer team also 
                    was responsible for cleaning, labeling, sorting, and dividing 
                    the artifacts recovered from the testing into broad categories: 
                    ceramics, glass, metal, and lithics (prehistoric chipped stone). 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Additional oral history interviews 
                    were conducted for the project, providing 
                    greater knowledge of what life was like during 
                    those days. Old timers recalled the different 
                    types of mill jobs and divisions of labor, 
                    how the houses were kept up, games the children 
                    played, and allusions to places at Aldridge 
                    that previously were unknown, such as a saloon 
                    and a boarding house. Some information confirmed 
                    locations of buildings and roads. </p>
                  <p class="text">As shown in the 1911 map, there were three areas 
                    for &quot;white&quot; residences and three areas for &quot;colored&quot; 
                    residences. Oral accounts have suggested that these houses 
                    were four rooms and placed on wooden piers. Each house had 
                    a wood heater and a cook stove, and every two houses shared 
                    a shallow well. Each house had an area for a milk cow and 
                    a picket-fenced garden area behind the house. The more-affluent 
                    mill operators lived on a street known as &quot;Silk Stocking,&quot; 
                    set apart from the smaller cottages. When the mill closed 
                    down, all of the houses were sold and removed as salvage. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In their survey of the area, archeologists located 
                    a series of concrete foundations on the river terrace which 
                    may be the remains of housing for two pumps which were denoted 
                    on the 1911 map. Tar-splotched sandstones were exposed just 
                    below the surface near the concrete foundations along with 
                    metal barrel loops and other industrial type debris, the likely 
                    remains of one of the pump houses or the round house. Concrete 
                    pads also were uncovered in some of the testing and most likely 
                    were associated with the blacksmith shop. These areas were 
                    also mapped, photographed and then backfilled for future work.</p>
                  <p class="text">The investigators found a wide 
                    range of domestic and industrial items from 
                    the early 1900s including fragments of decorated 
                    and plain ceramic tableware, stoneware vessels, 
                    glass bottles, lamp shades, ceramic doll parts, 
                    writing slates, buttons, buckles, bullets, 
                    and other items. Not surprisingly, heavy metal 
                    objects were in abundance, ranging from construction 
                    items such as nails and pipes to tools and 
                    parts of heavy machinery from the mill operation. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Several examples of ceramics date to the early 
                    to mid 1800s. This was not totally unexpected; historical 
                    research conducted in 1992 by then-forest archeologist Bob 
                    Skiles hints at the presence of an early 19th-century occupation 
                    at the site.</p>

                    heritage resource management projects within 
                    the national forests across the nation. These 
                    projects are designed to offer experience 
                    and introduce a conservation ethic to the 
                    public. Volunteers are given the opportunity 
                    to work with professional archeologists and/or 
                    historians. There is no fee for participation; 
                    however, some volunteers in the past have 
                    been known to travel great distances to participate 
                    in a PIT project. Their participation directly 
                    contributes to the understanding of the human 
                    story in North America and to the preservation 
                    of the fragile sites that chronicles this 
                    story. They share in new discoveries, learn 
                    the science of archeology and meet many new

                  <p class="text"><em>Passport In Time</i> was 
                    started in the Great Lakes State of Minnesota 
                    in 1988 and was initiated by the Forest Archeologist 
                    on the Superior National Forest. By 1991, 
                    there were 50 projects planned on 27 forests 
                    in 19 states; this equaled 23,283 hours by 
                    537 volunteers, at which time PIT became known 
                    as a national program. By 1992, 53 national 
                    forests in 24 states had projects planned 
                    equaling 82 projects with 1161 volunteers 
                    giving a total of 53,043 hours. In 1994 there 
                    were 113 projects planned with 1255 volunteers 
                    donating 57,001 hours.</p>
                  <p class="text">PIT is a grass roots program 
                    where volunteers are learning about conservation 
                    from a new perspective, the Forest Service 
                    is gaining help with our Heritage Resource 
                    Program, and a strong base of public awareness 
                    and support for preservation of historical 
                    resources is nurtured. The National Forests 
                    and Grasslands of Texas had 35 volunteers 
                    for this project (some who returned again 
                    in 1996), who provided over 1000 hours of 
                    work that could not have been funded otherwise. 
                    These projects were the first steps towards 
                    the development of a cadre of skilled and 
                    devoted volunteers dedicated to the preservation 
                    of their heritage resources on public lands. 
                    Today, the U. S. Forest Service has incorporated 
                    the Aldridge Mill and Township into an environmental 
                    and interpretive trail system that has allowed 
                    visitors to view the ruins and speculate upon 
                    the past.</p>
