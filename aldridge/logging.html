                          only by murky, meandering rivers. Caddo Indians had 
                          lived in these woodlands for thousands of years, felling 
                          trees for their tall, beehive-shaped houses and temples 
                          and constructing villages along the Red River, Neches 
                          and Sabine. But their impact, and that of the Anglo 
                          farmers who followed them, was light, and the forests 
                          maintained their dominance on the land. </p>

                          sawmill complexes and factory towns, 
                          the logging business became the primary

                          to family farms that supplied produce

                          Amid Forests of Plenty </h3>
                        <p class="text">On March 1, 1836, Texas declared its independence 
                          from Mexico and, through armed revolution, won its independence 
                          on May 12, 1836. As a fledgling nation, Texas was without 
                          any financial structure. In order to develop a treasury, 
                          Texas sold its only commodity&#151;land. This process 
                          stimulated land entrepreneurs, or speculators, to treat 
                          land as cash. Frequently a land grant was sold several 
                          times prior to actual survey. Some people began to acquire 
                          enormous landholdings, a factor that attracted corporate 
                          investment in large sawmill operations several decades 
                          later.</p>
                        <p class="text">The first sawmill identified 
                          with a specific individual is an 1829 
                          mill on Carrizo Creek in Nacogdoches 
                          County, built by entrepreneur and land 
                          speculator Peter Ellis Bean. Bean exemplifies 
                          the nature of the American frontiersmen 
                          who settled Texas. He first entered 
                          Texas in 1801, hunting horses and trading 
                          with Indians along the Brazos River, 
                          at a time when it was still under Spanish 
                          rule. He built a water-powered, sawmill 
                          (sash saw) and gristmill and also ran 
                          a lumberyard in Nacogdoches. Attracted 
                          by that success, other logging entrepreneurs 
                          began operations in Texas. </p>
                        <p class="text">In the decades before the Civil War, however, 
                          transportation was a continual problem. Due to the natural 
                          obstacles of rivers and muddy soils, few overland roads 
                          were suitable for travel at all times, particularly 
                          in East Texas. Rivers, which formed the backbone of 
                          commerce in the United States, were erratic in water 
                          flow and became clogged with logs, snags, and silt. 
                          Sawmill owners in the East Texas interior were forced 
                          to settle for local trade combining a grist mill and/or 
                          general merchandise store, while coastal lumbermen had 
                          developed a considerable export trade worldwide. </p>
                        <p class="text">The centers of commerce 
                          developed along the Gulf Coast, where 
                          marine shipping could interface with 
                          riverine steamboats and overland wagon 
                          haulers. Logging rafts, keelboats, and 
                          later steamboats operated only during 
                          optimal river flow conditions. Due to 
                          this lack of transportation, the vast 
                          pine forests of East Texas could not 
                          be fully exploited in a profitable manner. 
                          Consequently, despite the abundance 
                          of standing timber, there was a chronic 
                          shortage of lumber within Texas.</p>

                          in transportation began again after 
                          the war, particularly due to the liberal 
                          policies of the State, which granted 
                          land to rail companies for each mile 
                          of track they lay. By 1880, railroad 
                          development had reached a point where 
                          main lines connected most of East Texas.

                          milling operations. Concurrently, the forests of the 
                          Great Lakes were being cut out, and investment capitalists 
                          were turning their attention to the forests of the south, 
                          and Texas in particular. This marked the beginnings 
                          of an enormous period of growth for Texas logging and 
                          the rise of the big mills. Again, land speculators combed 
                          through the courthouses and land districts of East Texas, 
                          acquiring lands that were unclaimed or available for 
                          back taxes and putting together some of the largest

                          Period&quot; of the logging industry in East Texas. 
                          It was during this period that fortunes (both personal 
                          and corporate) were made. The larger mills that had 
                          been established earlier in the period grew larger and 
                          more powerful, while many of the smaller mills as well 
                          as some of the large mills that had come too late into 
                          the region, suffered from a lack of access to timber 
                          and were forced out.</p>
                        <p class="text">The Bonanza Period of industrial logging 
                          would never have occurred were it not for the introduction 
                          of the railroad to the forests of East Texas in the 
                          1880's. Prior to that time, transporting cut timber 
                          to the mills was a slow, tedious endeavor dependent 
                          upon draft animals, good weather, and good fortune. 
                          Initially logging was performed close to rivers, where 
                          water was used to ship the cut and seasoned logs to 
                          the mill. Staging areas were located at central areas. 
                          The logger cut the trees with an ax, using a saw to 
                          cut the tree to lengths. The trees were dragged by oxen 
                          or mule to the river bank where they were stacked awaiting 
                          high water. Once in the water the logs were joined into 
                          rafts, and floated to coastal mills.</p>
                        <p class="text">The advent of steam-powered, 
                          small-gauge trains and loaders made 
                          it possible to transport ever larger 
                          loads of logs to the mills. Once the 
                          railroad was extended into the interior, 
                          mills were constructed closer to the 
                          remaining virgin stands. Corporations 
                          built much larger mills along rail spurs 
                          in the remaining uncut areas of East 
                          Texas.</p>

                        <p class="text">Trees were selected, felled, 
                          scaled, and cut to transportable size 
                          by timber crews , usually 40 to 60 men 
                          supervised by a woods boss, known also 
                          as the &quot;bull of the woods.&quot; 
                          Conditions were often grueling, with 
                          workers putting in 10-hour days on back-breaking 
                          tasks in the forests, often many miles 
                          from the mill. Many experienced loggers 
                          were expert at their trade, able to 
                          notch, saw, and fell a tree with precision. 
                          In addition to cutting tasks, forest 
                          workers transported logs, worked on 
                          roads, and set miles of ties for rail 
                          tracks.</p>

                        <p class="text">By 1910 there were more 
                          than 600 sawmills in Texas, although 
                          probably no more than 100 could be considered 
                          large mills&#151;those with a capacity 
                          of 80,000-100,000 board feet. In many 
                          areas, the sawmill represented the only 
                          source of cash, and two or three generations 
                          often worked in turn at the mill. The 
                          mill created work where none had been 
                          available, and the owners had to provide 
                          housing, usually deducted from pay. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">In terms of operations, 
                          one of the most important features of 
                          the mill was the mill pond. It covered 
                          several acres and could hold up to four 
                          million board feet of logs. The water 
                          provided ease of loading and unloading, 
                          preserved the logs from bark beetle 
                          attacks, and washed dirt and soil off 
                          the logs, thus reducing wear on the 
                          saws. From the pond, the logs were moved 
                          onto a conveyor chain, and were hauled 
                          to the log deck. If no pond was available, 
                          rail tracks were placed as a siding 
                          as close to the saws as possible. </p>
                        <p class="text">A typical large sawmill 
                          was a complex of two or three story 
                          buildings divided according to each 
                          step of the lumber-making operation. 
                          The saw machinery usually was located 
                          on the second floor, the saw filer, 
                          who kept the saws sharpened, on the 
                          third floor. On the second floor, the 
                          scaler measured and sized the log, using 
                          the cutoff saw to section the long timber 
                          into efficient cutting lengths. Moved 
                          via a log kicker, logs were then sent 
                          to bandsaws, where the sawyer cut the 
                          log into boards. Once trimmed, the lumber 
                          was transported into the yard to dry 
                          and cure before it was finally sent 
                          to the planer for final processing. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">With the growth and expansion 
                          of mills came company towns, the small 
                          communities which were to dominate the 
                          landscape and economy of East Texas. 
                          The company town typically was isolated, 
                          placed near the critical resources&#151;large 
                          tracts of timber. As trees were cut 
                          down and forests used up, logging operations 
                          moved into more-remote areas, and more 
                          towns built. It was not uncommon for 
                          towns of a thousand people or more to 
                          spring up in a year's time.</p>
                        <p class="text">Mill towns were composed 
                          of segregated groups of houses for black 
                          and white workers and their families, 
                          a general store or commissary, a hotel/boarding 
                          house, company offices, churches, schools, 
                          and stores. In most towns, water was

                          indoor plumbing and electricity became 
                          available in some areas in the late 
                          1920s. Most homes had gardens and a

                          free in the yards. Wood cook stoves 
                          and potbellied stoves provided heating 
                          and served for food preparation. </p>
                        <p class="text">Mill towns varied as to 
                          amenities and comforts. While Fostoria, 
                          a milltown owned by the Foster Lumber 
                          Company of Kansas was described as clean, 
                          well-kept, and self-sustaining, Kirbyville, 
                          owned by the Kirby Lumber Company, was 
                          characterized by a visiting <em>Harper's 
                          Weekly </i>journalist as &quot;gray 
                          dingy boxes arranged row by row in the 
                          horror of dull uniformity that is the 
                          curse of most industrial communities.&quot; 
                          Generally, the larger and more influential 
                          mill owners, such as Lutcher and Moore, 
                          T.L.L. Temple, the Thompson Brothers, 
                          and Carter-Kelly companies, were responsible 
                          for the more well developed and advanced 
                          mill towns, with electrical power and 
                          running water available to most, if 
                          not all, mill town residents.</p>
                        <p class="text">In some towns, deep bonds 
                          were formed between company and workers. 
                          During the Depression, the Southern 
                          Pine Lumber Company was forced to sell 
                          about 100,000 acres for less than $3 
                          an acre to keep its sawmill working. 
                          Many Diboll employees repaid the loyalty 
                          the company had shown them by lending 
                          the company small sums of money they 
                          had managed to save.</p>
                        <p class="text">In addition to mill towns, 
                          the East Texas forests were dotted with 
                          temporary camps and make-shift towns 
                          for the workers in the woods&#151;those 
                          involved in cutting and harvesting trees 
                          and making wood products. There were 
                          front camps, often constructed along 
                          rail trams as staging areas for workers; 
                          turpentine camps, where pine resins 
                          were harvested and made into turpentine; 
                          tie camps where railroad ties were collected 
                          and shipped; stave camps, where barrel 
                          staves were made; tent camps along railroads 
                          or in remote settings; and the cutting 
                          front itself. Boxcars and tents typically 
                          served as housing for the forest workers. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">These facilities were 
                          usually established next to the main 
                          lines of the logging railroads, which 
                          connected them with the primary mill 
                          and its mill town. These logging railroads, 
                          or trams, provided not only the principal 
                          means of carrying cut timber to the 
                          mill, but also functioned as a basic 
                          transportation system for the front 
                          camp workers, who usually had families 
                          living in the primary mill towns. These 
                          trams were extended as the logging fronts 
                          advanced through the virgin pine forests, 
                          often resulting in an intricate spiderweb 
                          design of cleared routes that would 
                          eventually become the basis for a fully 
                          developed rural transportation system 
                          of Farm-to-Market and County Roads. 
                          Without this infrastructure, the modern 
                          development of East Texas would not 
                          have been possible.</p>

                        <p class="text">In 1917, Robert W. Wier 
                          and the Lutcher and Moore heirs combined 
                          resources to construct the last large 
                          mill at the town of Wiergate, with timberlands 
                          covering about 86,000 acres in Newton, 
                          Jasper, and Sabine counties. The Wiergate 
                          Lumber Company logged what was perhaps 
                          the last great Texas stand of longleaf 
                          pine. </p>
                        <p class="text">By 1920, many of the lands 
                          acquired by the big mills had been cut 
                          out, leaving tangled thickets of second 
                          growth hardwoods, mixed with a few pine 
                          seedlings. Foresters and conservationists 
                          complained that the practice of free-range 
                          husbandry eliminated pine regeneration 
                          and promoted the growth of hardwood, 
                          thereby eliminating the potential for 
                          sustained yield logging. Some companies 
                          moved to the West Coast, where large 
                          tracts of lands and forest were available 
                          to sustain the cut-and-run method of 
                          logging. Others went bankrupt, letting 
                          their lands fall into receivership.</p>
                        <p class="text">Because Texas had retained 
                          its public lands when it became a state 
                          in 1845, the federal government lacked 
                          national parks and forests in the state. 
                          In May 1933, the Texas legislature passed 
                          a bill, supported by both lumbermen 
                          and conservation groups that authorized 
                          the U.S. Forest Service to appraise 
                          and purchase lands. The federal government 
                          purchased more than 90% of the lands 
                          that were to comprise the National Forests 
                          in Texas from 11 lumber companies. </p>

                          of Agriculture began an agreement program 
                          with Texas lumber companies and private 
                          individuals to develop working plans 
                          to restore the forests and develop a 
                          sustained yield strategy. From the 1930's 
                          to the present, the U.S. Forest Service 
                          has replenished the East Texas forest 
                          reserves and developed effective sustained 
                          yield practices, while conserving soil, 
                          water, and other natural resources.</p>

                          early 20th century logging industry. 
                          Mill towns have become cities; logging

                          can be found in the four National Forests 
                          in Texas represent the full range of 
                          logging industry-related sites and features. 
                          Major mills and mill towns, such as 
                          Aldridge and 4-C, represent the highest 
                          level of development, with multiple 
                          saws, large residential areas, commissaries, 
                          hotels, schools, churches, and other 
                          conveniences one would expect in a small 
                          community. Smaller front camps, such 
                          as Bannister, Brittain, Wilburn and 
                          Ragtown, while smaller and only temporarily 
                          occupied, contain equally complex features 
                          as the larger mill towns. These essentially 
                          mobile encampments were laid out in 
                          a precise pattern with primary and intersecting 
                          secondary thoroughfares lined by tents 
                          or other types of temporary housing.

                        <p class="text">In 1993, the Texas Forestry Museum began 
                          development of a database of historic sawmills in the 
                          twelve county area defined as the Deep East Texas Council 
                          of Governments. The Museum was joined in this development 
                          by the T.L.L. Temple Archives, the Sam Houston Regional 
                          Library, the USDA Forest Service and the School of Forestry 
                          at Stephen F. Austin State University. By the end of 
                          1994, over 5,500 sawmills and logging industry related 
                          sites, located in forty counties from the Red River 
                          to the Gulf Coast in the eastern third of Texas, were 
                          listed on the database. By the end of 1995, a linked 
                          database of Steam Logging Rail Roads had been also been 
                          developed. In 1998, the sawmill database was made available 
                          to the general public through the Texas Historic Sites 
                          Atlas Project, Texas Historic Commission and Texas Archeological 
                          Research Laboratory.</p>
