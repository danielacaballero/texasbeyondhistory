    <td width="480" valign="top"><p>Excavations at the Pipeline site (41PT185/C) uncovered a shallowly buried Late  Archaic component, one of the few    of this time period to be intensively investigated in  the entire Texas Panhandle and adjacent states.&nbsp;  Two major  camping events were represented within the  40-cm thick  target zone. The remains had been disturbed, however, and could not be vertically separated.</p>
      <p>A total of 14 radiocarbon dates on  charcoal and on bison bones document the ages for the two represented  camps.&nbsp; The older camp was radiocarbon  dated to ca. 2400 B.P., and the younger camp was radiocarbon dated by four  dates to ca. 1600 B.P.&nbsp; A slight  horizontal overlap of these two camps was detected, but in general the camps  were horizontally separated towards each end of the block.&nbsp; The fine-grained deposits that encased these  Late Archaic materials sloped in two directions and had been exposed for a period  of time prior to burial. &nbsp;&nbsp;Since burial, some  mixing through considerable rodent activity has occurred.&nbsp; For these reasons, the assemblages from the  two camps could not be clearly separated.&nbsp;  Therefore, the entire Late Archaic component was analyzed as one  assemblage.</p>
      <p>This component yielded a relatively  limited stone tool assemblage that included chipped-stone tools, a few ground  stone tools, numerous burned rock features (heating elements and burned rock discard/dumps),   flaking debris, and a moderate quantity of animal bone.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The Late Archaic component included  21 cultural features which reflected, for the most part, specific activities or campsite maintenance.&nbsp; Eighteen of these  included mostly burned rocks.&nbsp; Four (Features 4, 8, 12, and 18) were tight clusters of rocks with roughly  circular outlines thought to be heating elements.&nbsp; Ten other features consisted mostly of burned  rocks that had been discarded following their use, and these are considered  dump areas. Two features contained burned rocks, bison bones, and lithic debris  and represent general refuse areas.&nbsp;</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="480"><p>Non-burned rock features included a  badly weathered, inverted bison skull with a partially crushed top of the  skull.&nbsp; Another feature contained  multiple pieces of half a metate, or grinding slab.&nbsp; A third consisted of two large natural rocks  that were carried into this site by humans. </p>

      <h3>Burned Rock Analyses</h3>
      <p>Two types of technical analyses were conducted on burned rock  samples selected from the various features.&nbsp;  A chemical approach, lipid residue analysis, was preformed on 45 burned  rocks from at least 10 features.&nbsp;      
      <p> Based on lipid analyses, almost all the burned rock samples had  residues  attributable to plants, with many additionally registering traces of animal fats. Results are as follows: 37 percent of the burned rocks sampled came  in contact with high to very high fat content plant seeds or nuts.&nbsp; Another 40 percent yielded high to very high fat  content plant (seeds or nuts) with a trace of animal products.&nbsp; Minimally, five samples (13.2 percent)  yielded a combination of large herbivore fatty meat and plants, three other  samples (8 percent) yielded combinations of plant and animal.  The  large herbivore (likely bison) and plant residues were identified from at least  six cultural features.&nbsp; Cholesterol, the  lipid biomarker of animal products, was present in almost half (45 percent) of  the identified residues.&nbsp;       
      <p><br>
        The second technical analysis targeted starch grains from plant products.&nbsp;  Starch is  found in most plants such as seeds, tubers, etc. and starch grains are  insoluble in water.&nbsp; Starch grains are  tiny and only visible under high-powered microscopic magnification.&nbsp; It requires a highly trained specialist not  only to see them, but to identify them to a specific plant.&nbsp;       
      <p>Fragments of the same rocks analyzed for lipid  residues were also subjected to this analysis.&nbsp;  Of these, 14 burned rocks (34 percent) yielded lenticular starch grains;  9 (22 percent) yielded damaged starch grains from processing the natural  grains; and 13 (32 percent) yielded gelatinized starch grains.&nbsp; The gelatinization was created by exposure to  heat and water.&nbsp; The lenticular starch  grains were identified as Canadian wildrye (<em>Elymus  canadensis</em>) grass.&nbsp; Damaged starch  grains occurred during grinding or pounding of the seeds.
      <h3>Stone Tools</h3>
  <p>A relatively narrow range of stone tools was  recovered from these campsites.&nbsp; This  includes 133 chipped stone tools that represent at least five different  functional classes based on  size and shape characteristics.&nbsp; The formal chipped stone tools include 21  dart points and fragments, 21 bifaces, 8 scrapers, one drill base, and one  uniface.&nbsp; Over 70 edge-modified  pieces or informal tools reflect a range of minor edge alterations and  functions.&nbsp; Ten metate fragments and one mano  fragment also were present.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>One of the dart points and ten of the  dart point bases are clearly corner-notched, and these have more or less a stemmed  appearance.&nbsp; Corner-notched points   with such pronounced stems have not been previously reported among Late Archaic sites in the Texas Panhandle.&nbsp; Another of the nearly complete corner-notched  points has the more common wide expanding stem, and low tangs, but it is  definitely in the minority here.</p>
      <p>One of the most interesting chipped-stone  tools is a nearly complete corner-tang knife.&nbsp;  Not only was this a rare discovery in the middle of a campsite, but it  had an unusual context.&nbsp; It was found cached  under a large natural rock away from any recognizable feature.&nbsp; High-powered use-wear analysis on this  unwashed knife indicates it was hafted and used to cut soft hides and starchy  plants.&nbsp; However, subsequent starch grain  analysis failed to find any starch grains.&nbsp;  This unusual piece was manufactured from local Alibates; thus, it was  not traded in from central Texas, but made locally.</p>
      <p>The high-powered use-wear analysis on  a suite of chipped-stone tools that included projectile points, bifaces, and  scrapers identified haft-wear on most formal tools.&nbsp; That in itself may not seem unusual, but  most often this is usually just speculated upon in most analysis.&nbsp; Here, the haft-wear identified on most formal  tools extends to about midway along the artifact no matter what its size.&nbsp; This was true on bifaces, end scrapers and a  couple of the more completed projectiles.&nbsp;  This reveals a consistent hafting technique within this Late Archaic assemblage.&nbsp; It also reflects a specific behavior and  means of securing these tools to a shaft or haft.</p>
      <h3>Raw Material</h3>
       <p> The lithic debitage (<em>N</em> = 212) is represented by 76 percent  Alibates from the local source area some 57 km to the north.&nbsp; Unidentified debitage accounts for 8.7  percent, with Tecovas a distant third with only 5 percent.&nbsp; Local Potter chert accounts for 4.6 percent, and  local Ogallala gravels represent less than one percent.&nbsp; </p>
       <p>
         A few Edwards chert pieces, likely  from the Callahan Divide region 350 km to the south, and 10 obsidian pieces  from north-central New Mexico  were also identified.&nbsp; The obsidian was  sourced by x-ray refraction technique to three different outcrops: the Valles  Rhyolite, the El Rechuelos Rhyolite, and the Cerro Toledo Rhyolite in north-central New Mexico.&nbsp; These sources were represented by an equal  number of pieces.&nbsp; One piece was more  closely linked to modern glass and one &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; piece exhibits chemistry more  similar to a mafic or intermediate volcanic rock.&nbsp;</p>
       <p> These  latter nonlocal pieces indicate limited contact or trade with groups from  adjacent regions.&nbsp; It is well established  that the Later Plains Village Antelope Creek populations traded for New Mexico obsidian some 800 years  later.&nbsp; The east-west trading in obsidian  from central New Mexico  out onto the Plains during the Antelope appears to have started at least during  the Late Archaic times by 2400 B.P.&nbsp; The  extensive use of the local, high quality Alibates indicates these Late Archaic  populations were well acquainted with, and used the local lithic  resources.&nbsp; It may also indicate this is  this populations home territory.</p>
       <p>To aid in the visual identification  of the different raw material types used by these prehistoric populations in  this project area, and to enable correct sorting between the visually close  appearance of Alibates and Tecovas, Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) was  conducted.&nbsp; This analysis included 71 cultural pieces from the three sites, as well as 55 pieces of natural raw  materials.&nbsp; The natural pieces included  30 pieces of Tecovas from six different source localities in the panhandle and  25 pieces of Alibates from three sources.&nbsp;  The Alibates sources include the Alibates  National Monument, the same  Quartermaster formation outcrops on the northern side of Lake  Meredith opposite the National  Monument, and a high Pleistocene gravel terrace located downstream from the  main outcrop where State Highway 71 crosses the Canadian   River.&nbsp; The INAA results  determined that the chemical fingerprint of Tecovas is distinguishable from  that of Alibates.&nbsp; Although the current  Tecovas sample is quite limited in number, some chemical differences in the  Tecovas source areas were detected by county.&nbsp;  This is extremely significant because as more Tecovas samples are  analyzed, it may become possible to determine which specific county the sample  came from. </p>
       <h3>Animal Bone</h3>
       <p> A relatively high frequency of faunal  bones was recovered (5,337 pieces).&nbsp;  About 18 percent of the fragments were sufficiently complete to  identify.&nbsp; Nearly 940 pieces were  identified as bison bones, with only 1.6 percent identified as non-bison.&nbsp; Most bones were highly fragmented, with only  about 26 percent considered complete or nearly complete. The high percentage of  fragments indicates that not only was meat targeted, but bone marrow and bone  grease were extracted.&nbsp; The proximal  (roughly 12.5 percent) and distal ends (9.8 percent) of long bones that were  identified and measured to determine sex indicate that the kill occurred a  considerable distance from this camp as the bulky skull with little meat and  the vertebrae were drastically underrepresented.&nbsp; Measurements on the 25 mature articular ends  of the intact long bones indicate 41 percent were male and 59 percent were  female.&nbsp; Based on a combination of data, including  the fusion rates of the long bones, the sex differences documented, and the  animal ages established from analysis of the teeth and mandibles, at least 13  bison were represented.&nbsp; This includes at  least three males and six females, plus one newborn animal.&nbsp; Based on individual bison tooth eruption and  wear patterns the season(s) of the kill(s) was determined to be fall.&nbsp; This is probably true for both  campsites.&nbsp; The out of season new born  bison identified is not all that unusual in natural herds. </p>
       <p>The non-bison specimens include a  single dog mandible with cut marks and a few scattered deer elements.&nbsp; These undoubtedly represent other probable  food resources.&nbsp; Other animals identified  include; badger, mink, turtle, and prairie dog, but these are considered  intrusive to the Late Archaic component.&nbsp;  This interpretation is based on their overall lighter color, lack of  similar weathering patterns, and less extensive root etching in comparison to  the bison bones.&nbsp; </p>
      <h3>Plants in the Diet</h3>
     <p> In addition to the bison that served as the major meat  resource, wildrye grass seeds also provided a significant contribution the Late  Archaic diet at this locality.&nbsp; Starch  grain analysis on the burned rocks (see above) coupled with wildrye seed starch  on 75 percent of the metate fragments analyzed, clearly documents this plant  food.&nbsp; In fact, the starch grain analysis  has documented the full range of grass seed processing activities.&nbsp; Here, damaged wildrye starch grains were on a  hammer, ground grains were on metates, and cooked starch, as indicated by  gelatinized grains, were on the burned rocks.&nbsp;</p>
     <p> This finding is significant inasmuch as the plant gathering aspect of the hunter-gatherer ecomomy is mostly based on speculation. Due to poor preservation of plant remains, most macrobotanical analyses from open mobile hunter-gatherer camps  have yielded limited or no evidence for plant use.</p></td>
