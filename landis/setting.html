      <p>Paleoenvironmental reconstruction is a key tool for understanding how peoples of the past made their living and perhaps even why  certain locales were selected time and again for campsites. Depending on severity, climatic fluctuations could significantly impact plant and animal communities and, by extension, the Native groups who depended upon  natural resources.  </p>
      <p>During the Landis project, environmental changes during the late Holocene were documented through a variety of analyses, including determining the presence or relative abundance  of  environmentally sensitive plants and animals. Alluvial deposits revealed complex histories, including evidence of floods and drought, as well as more stable conditions. </p>
      <p>  Sediment samples were collected  for a variety of technical analyses on pollen, phytoliths,  diatoms, ostracods, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, and mollusks (see<a href="images/paleoenv-readmore.html" target="_blank"> Clues to Past Environments</a> for more detail). Thirteen radiocarbon  dated samples from selected depositional units were used to document the past  environments at specific points in time during the last 10,000 years. &nbsp;Weaving together these various lines of data suggests a dynamic mosiac of environments in this area, fluctuating periodically from cool and moist periods,  when   West Amarillo Creek flowed more regularly to dry and warm conditions, when ponded wetlands prevailed. </p>
      <h3>Pollen and Phytolith Evidence </h3>
      <p>Pollen and  phytoliths extracted from dated samples provide a point-in-time glimpse of the  broad changes that occurred in the paleoenvironment here in the upper reaches  of West Amarillo Creek.&nbsp; In  general terms, the early Holocene period (ca. 10,850 B.P.) was relatively cold,  with mostly grassland vegetation and a few  deciduous trees  and shrubs.&nbsp; A gradual warming trend  occurred over the next thousand years or so. </p>
      <p>By about 8280 B.P.,  however, the area once again had cooled. Cool season grasses (C3) dominated, and more deciduous trees and  shrubs were present. These indicators point to  temperature  similar to  earlier (at 10,850 B.P.).</p>
      <p>By 4330 B.P.  the conditions were much warmer and drier with increases in short, warm season  (C4 ) grasses.&nbsp; This created a  grassland-dominated region containing far fewer deciduous trees and  shrubs.&nbsp; The pollen and phytolith  assemblage at 4330 B.P. is very similar to that at 9600 B.P.&nbsp; By 2250 B.P. vegetation consisted of slightly  more humid grassland with few deciduous trees and shrubs.&nbsp; At 1890 B.P. it was much warmer and more arid  with increased C4 (warm season) grasses.&nbsp;  Pine pollen had blown in from distant sources to the west.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>A  major change occurred around 1840 B.P. with cooler conditions, based on the  increase in mid to tall, cool season (C3) grasses.&nbsp; However, over the subsequent 400 years or so, conditions  again warmed and became drier<strong>, </strong>with another increase of C4 grasses and  decrease in C3 grasses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Willow pollen decreased at  that time, which also indicates a warming trend.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Another cooling was evident by 1430 B.P., with conditions  similar to those at 1840 B.P. Another shift followed. &nbsp; By 860 B.P. conditions had again warmed and  dried with few C3 grasses and an increase in C4  grasses.&nbsp; Pine pollen had again increased  which may reflect a regional drying trend.&nbsp; The absence of oak and willow pollen also may indicate increased aridity.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>This  general warming trend continued until ca. 600 B.P. when local conditions were  much cooler, based on the higher frequencies of the C3 grasses.&nbsp; Another change occurred with a more arid and  warmer environment by 300 B.P. as reflected by the increase in C4  grasses.&nbsp; In summary, the changing  frequencies in pollen and phytoliths over time reflect a dynamic vegetation  history and paleoenvironment for the West Amarillo Creek valley, here in the  Texas Panhandle.</p>
      <h3>Alluvial Deposits and Carbon Isotopes </h3>
      <p>Tracking  changes to the climatic conditions through the various depositional units is a  relatively subjective approach.&nbsp; Here, we  examine the variations in the stable carbon isotopic composition of the  organic carbon in  alluvial deposits through the last 4,500 years (Units C,  D, and E; see graphic at right) as a proxy record for changing vegetation within the West Amarillo Creek  valley.&nbsp; Previous investigations  across the region also reflect this broad pattern of vegetation change. There is a fluctuating trend of decrease in C4  plant matter which reflects an increase in moisture to a peak in Unit D,  between 1900 and 1450 B.P.</p>
      <p> Immediately following that time and extending to about 1200 B.P.&nbsp;there is a  dramatic increase in C4 matter (from below 40 percent to nearly 74  percent). This  increase is followed by  continued fluctuations ranging up to 20 percent.&nbsp; The primary difference between this sequence  and previous work in the region around Lake Alan Henry, located just off the  eastern Escarpment, is the specifics of timing of the maximum period of wet  (mesic) conditions. </p>
      <p>For  a more in-depth reconstruction of the last 2,000 years, a single 5-m tall  column of sediment exposed on the valley floor in backhoe trench 36, next to  the Pipeline site (41PT185), was targeted.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time  frame, from roughly 1890 to ca. 430 B.P., is represented by depositional Unit  D, which was tested through multiple samples.&nbsp;  Again, a multi-disciplinary approach was used to investigate this period through pollen,  phytolith, and diatom analyses. Selected  samples were analyzed for micro-invertebrates (snail shells and mollusks),  calcareous algae, and stable carbon isotopes from ostracods.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The  initial period of deposition of Unit D (ca. 1900 to 1430 B.P.) was followed by a period of  channel entrenchment when the stream carried a high sediment load.&nbsp; Soon after, a year-round pond/marsh was  established in the stream bottom with some intervals of flowing conditions within  a sandy channel.&nbsp; Both the diatoms and  the ostracods indicate that this early wetland contained a fluctuating level of  moderately alkaline, shallow water with emergent vegetation, such as cattail, sedges,  and willow trees that lined the banks.&nbsp;  The snail fauna of this early pond was primarily terrestrial, which is  at odds with the clear evidence of wetland conditions.&nbsp; During this period a complex suite of  microenvironments ranging from sandy mud flats to small pools existed.&nbsp; Towards the end of this period a series of  larger magnitude floods occurred that deposited several beds of gravel.&nbsp; In broad terms, this is considered a cool and  moist period.</p>
      <p>Around  1400 B.P. a more persistent wetland became established, which varied between a  marshy wet meadow and periods when deeper pools and ponding water prevailed.&nbsp; Cottonwood  and oak trees replaced willows.&nbsp; Water  salinity and alkalinity varied throughout this period.&nbsp; Sometime around 800 B.P., and before 430 B.P.,  the water levels declined and the valley floor shifted to a sandy bottom that  was often dry.&nbsp; Occasionally, isolated  marshy areas existed.&nbsp; This is more of a  gradual warming and drying period.&nbsp; The  very end of Unit D reflects a subtle trend to cooler and moister conditions and  may have triggered the incision of the creek channel prior to the deposition of  Unit E.</p>
      <p>Combining  the evidence from archeological, depositional, and paleoenvironmental  investigations provides a deeper understanding of the local and regional  environments in which the prehistoric populations lived. In particular, these  investigations set the scene for evaluating the cultural evidence left  by Late Archaic and Protohistoric groups on West Amarillo Creek. </p></td>
