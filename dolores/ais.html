        <p>The Ais Indians, for whom Mission  Dolores was intended and named, <em>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores de los Ais</em>,  were a relatively small tribe living on the southern fringe of the homeland of  the numerous Caddo-speaking groups. Frustratingly  little is known about the Ais (also referred to as the Ay, Ays, Ayx, Ayche, Aiche, Aizes, Aies,  Aes, Aliche, Ayish, Eyish, Eyeish, Hais, and Haychis).&nbsp;The Ais have been mentioned in documents ever since the first direct  European contact in the vicinity of modern day San Augustine, Texas. Mentioned, but never described in depth and  never in quite the same way. </p>
        <p>It is likely that the Ais spoke a Caddoan  language that had diverged from Caddo and other Caddoan languages in the  distant past. In addition to their own  language, the Ais were said to speak Caddo proper, suggesting that they maintained  close relations with their neighbors and linguistic &ldquo;cousins.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>In  the historical record, the Ais were first encountered in 1542 when remnants of  the De Soto expedition led by Moscoso, passed through the area. Expedition accounts mention the Ais, and  describe them as warlike and very much attached to hunting buffalo. One hundred and forty-five years later the  Ais are one of the groups recorded by the Frenchman Henri  Joutel in 1687 when he passes through the area as part of the failed colony established by La Salle on the Texas coast (see <strong><a href="../stlouis/index.html">Fort St. Louis</a></strong>). When the first Spanish  missions were established in East Texas in 1690, the Ais were said to be at odds with the Haisinai. In 1699 they were purportedly associated with allied Indian groups under the overall  leadership of the Cadohadacho, according to Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville who learned this  information from a Taensas Indian. In 1708, the French were trading for  horses with the Ais, and in 1713 St. Denis returned to the area to get more horses from the  Ais and other Indian groups. </p>
<p align="left">A mission for the Ais was not initially planned when  the Spanish returned to East Texas in 1716&mdash;the missions for the Ais and Adaes  seem more like afterthoughts, as  the visits to these two groups are not recorded in the official diary of the  expedition.  Father  Antonio Margil probably  already knew of the Ais and Adaes when he promised to build a mission for them  on his way to visit Natchitoches in  1717. More details about the Ais become  available after Mission Dolores was initially established in 1717.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> The mission was located roughly in the center  of eight Ais settlements in the area of the Ayish Bayou. In  1727, Fathers Pedro Mu&ntilde;oz and Joseph Calahorra&mdash;both visitors to Mission Dolores&mdash;describe  the Ais as a &ldquo;great nation&rdquo; and relate that even though no Ais were living at  the mission, baptisms had been administered since 1717. The baptisms are described as <em>in articulo mortis</em>, or at the point of  death&mdash;that is, just before death. Pedro  Rivera, leader of the military inspections at Presidios Dolores and Adaes observed  the following in 1727:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>The  eight tribes living in the area&mdash;the Adays, Ays, Nacodoches, Aynays, Nazones,  Nechas, Naconomes, and Navidachos&mdash;are all docile and peace-loving in  nature. Although the French have  furnished them with firearms, with which the Indians are proficient, they  nonetheless respect mounted and armed soldiers. The submission shown to the soldiers evidences the calm nature of the  Indians. </em> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; Naylor and Polzer 1988:157</p>
        </blockquote>
      <p>The Ais were among the Indian groups who came to the aid of the French, along with soldiers from Los Adaes, when the Natchez attacked Fort St. Jean Baptiste at Natchitoches in 1731. </p> 
        <p>Father Ygnacio Cypri&aacute;n of Mission Dolores wrote a letter  with a report in 1749. Cypri&aacute;n relates  that there are 70 families of Ais located in eight settlements within two  leagues (just over five miles) of the mission.  Starting around 1740, Cypri&aacute;n was successful in congregating some of the  Ais at the mission, but when supplies ran out, the Ais returned to their  villages. That the Ais actually settled  at the mission is a most unusual occurrence for the Spanish missions of the piney woods. Cypri&aacute;n reports baptisms <em>in articulo mortis</em>, but he is  particularly upset that that three Ais children who were baptized alive in  1731, subsequently turned to a life of apostasy and died as apostates. Cypri&aacute;n states that it was the Ais tribe that  made the baptized children return to idolatry and implies that baptizing  children may not be such a good idea since it creates an undue strain on the  children. In 1754, there had been 158  baptisms recorded at Mission Dolores.</p>
        <p>An inspection of the East Texas missions by Father Gaspar de Sol&iacute;s in  1767-68 provides one of the most detailed accounts of the mission and the  Ais. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>The Indians of the Ays Nation came with their  captain whom they called Urjata&ntilde;a. I asked them  by means of an interpreter if they wished to congregate themselves and live with  the Fathers in the  mission. They replied that they did not, and this I judge  improbable in their present condition.  They danced in their heathenish manner with extraordinary and unusual ceremony  and grimaces.&hellip;&nbsp;</em></p>
          <p><em>The Indians of this Ays Nation are the worst of  this Province: drunkards, thieves, given  to mitotes and dances, and to all kinds of vice, principally that of  licentiousness. They are idle, overly  audacious, shameless. They have lost  respect for many of the Religious in work and deed, even laying their hands on  them. &nbsp;&#9472;&nbsp; Sol&iacute;s 1931:66-67.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>In the early 1770s, shortly before the mission was closed, a  French trader, Athanase De M&eacute;zi&egrave;res reported that the Ais numbered only 30 men,  which probably meant a total population of around 120. In 1776 De M&eacute;zi&egrave;res reported that the Ais are &ldquo;almost  extinct as a nation; four years ago the small pox destroyed the greater of them.&rdquo;  And in 1779 he relates that the surviving Ais were hated by both their Spanish and Indian  neighbors. In  1795,  Ais Indians accompany Antonio Leal to La Bahia to ask for another  mission&mdash;this request is refused and the Ais are settled on the Brazos  River. John Sibley, the U.S. Indian  Agent living in Natchitoches implies that in 1806 the Ais had moved from the  Ayish Bayou, which was then occupied by a few French and American  families. Sibley said of the Ais, &ldquo;their native  language is spoken by no other nation; but they speak and understand Caddo,  with whom they are in amity, often visiting one another.&rdquo; <br>
          <br>
          In 1820, the Ais are described as living near the Attoyac  River, although  it is more likely that the Ais were living near the Brazos at this time. Concerning  the Ais,  Juan Antonio Padilla&rsquo;s report  relates, &ldquo;They are very much like the Cad&oacute;, differing from them only in  language and in the manner of shaving their heads. They number about three hundred Indians. They pierce their noses and paint their faces  with vermillion. They are fond of the  Spaniards.&rdquo; The 1828 census reports 160  Ais families, quite a large number, and indicates that they lived between the  Brazos and Colorado Rivers. In 1830,  Jean Louis Berlandier echoes Padilla and relates that the Ais &ldquo;. . . very much  resemble the Cado, except for the tattoos on their noses and the way they shave  their heads.&rdquo; By 1837, the Report of the  Standing Committee on Indian Affairs relates that the Ais and Nacogdoche are  living dispersed among the Caddo, Inoni (formerly Hainai) and Anadarko  (formerly Nadaco). <br><br>
          There is very much a mixed picture related to how well the  Ais got along with the Spanish and other Indian groups, and perhaps, this is  the way it actually was&mdash;sometimes the Ais got along well with others, and  sometimes they didn&rsquo;t. John Swanton,  author of the most comprehensive survey of documents related to the Caddo, sums  it up as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <em>Part  of the secret of their disreputable character is probably to be found in the  circumstance that they were a small tribe with a peculiar dialect of Caddo and  a relatively undeveloped culture. For  this reason, without doubt, they&nbsp;&nbsp;were looked down upon by other Caddo before  any mission was established among them</em> &mdash;Swanton 1996:126<br>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One thing is certain, the Ais were most definitely  politically tied to the Hasinai and Kadohadacho, even if they were somewhat  different culturally. In the 1700s and  early 1800s the Ais are mentioned with Hasinai groups (i.e. Nabedache,  Nacogdoches, Hainai) in dealings with the French, as part of military  operations against the Spanish, and as part of political dealings with the  Americans. In 1896, The Ais were remembered  by the Caddo as one of the 12 affiliated groups that came to Oklahoma, and  Cecil Carter relates that &ldquo;Aays or Hais (in some later records spelled Ais,  Haish, or Eyeish) is a name still familiar to Caddo people&rdquo; (Carter  1995:364). A Hasinai chief who rose to  prominence in the 1800s was named Aasch (also Aash, Iesh&mdash;the Mexicans and  Americans called him Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a) and he led the Caddo and affiliated groups out  of Texas to Oklahoma in 1859.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Aboriginal Artifacts  at Mission Dolores</strong><br>
        </h3>
        <p>
          American Indian pottery dominates the archaeological  assemblage from Mission Dolores as over 90% of  pottery sherds  (13,013 out of 14,091 sherds) are from aboriginal pottery vessels.  This is the pattern at many of the Spanish missions in Texas, which is  to be expected because substantial populations of Indians lived at many of the the missions. But the pattern at Mission Dolores is  somewhat surprising because Indian populations, for the most part, did not live  at the east Texas missions. Clearly  there was a great deal of interaction between the Spanish at Dolores and the  nearby American Indians, presumably the Ais.  Some of the aboriginal pottery has European influences, especially  shallow brimmed bowls that would have looked like soup bowls, but most is  indistinguishable from the early historic Indian pottery found at many sites in  the region. </p>
        <p>Some of the aboriginal pottery sherds at Mission Dolores  have different patterns of incised or engraved lines and punctates, but  most&mdash;roughly 90%&mdash;have a plain surface.  The most common named pottery type is Natchitoches Engraved; other types  include Patton Engraved and Emory Punctated.  The small white specks seen in most of the pottery sherds at Mission  Dolores are fragments of burnt bone added as &ldquo;temper&rdquo; to reduce the amount of  shrinkage during drying and firing of the vessel. &nbsp;Less commonly, crushed fragments of burnt  shell temper were added.</p>
        <p>The pottery assemblage from Mission Dolores  is similar to Los Adaes, although for some pottery types, such as Ebarb  Incised&mdash;the Los Adaes examples are shell-tempered while the Mission Dolores  examples are bone-tempered. Pottery sherds with a brushed surface  treatment are notably lacking at Mission Dolores. Brushed sherds are  common at the Spradley Site (41NA206), a Nacogdoche village site located about  three miles south of Nacogdoches, and other historical period Indian sites in  the area. Brushed sherds are absent at Los Adaes. The general lack  of brushed sherds at Mission Dolores and Los Adaes may be a pottery attribute  associated with the Ais and Adaes during the 18th century. </p>
        <p>Jim Corbin suggested that the pottery recovered from Mission  Dolores can be distinguished from pottery recovered from other archaeological  sites of the 18th century in the region, and refers to it as the Ais  Constituent Group. It is similar to the  Adai Constituent Group found at <strong><a href="../adaes/index.html">Mission San Miguel de Cuellar de  los Adaes</a></strong>. The aboriginal pottery found at  both missions includes the Natchitoches Engraved and Emory Punctated types with  similar designs, except differing in predominate temper &ndash; bone at Mission Dolores and  shell at Los Adaes<strong>. </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Another category of Indian artifacts found at Mission  Dolores is projectile points. Some are Archaic dart points that reflect much  earlier use of the area along Ais Bayou.  Most, however, are small triangular projectile points that are true  arrow heads of the style commonly found at Spanish Colonial sites in  Texas. These arrow points are made of  chert (flint) and less commonly glass.  While it is likely that the Ais Indians made and used most of the   arrow points found at Mission Dolores, identical points were also made by other  American Indian groups in Spanish Colonial Texas, and may also have been used  by Indians who served as soldiers and scouts in the Spanish military. </p></td>
