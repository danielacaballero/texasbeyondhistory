              <br>
              <br>
              <p>The desire for a replication of Mission Dolores is still the driving force   behind activity at the mission interpretive complex today. Built in 1998, the   complex includes a state-of-the-art museum and archaeology lab. Although the   building of a replica of the mission was included in the master plan for the   interpretive complex, the replica could not be constructed. Recall that for over   forty years the mission location could not be verified. Once Corbin finally   succeeded, he found that not enough of the mission survived to allow an accurate   reconstruction or even replication of the mission complex. Too much remains   unknowable.</p>  
              <p>A renewed effort to build a replica of Mission Dolores was begun in 2007 by   the San Augustine County Historical Society.&nbsp;The overall effort was coordinated   by James Bruseth, who directs the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical   Commission. The shovel testing survey project conducted by George Avery in 2008   was a direct result. Yet this work confirmed yet again that there was not enough   surviving evidence to allow an accurate replica to be built.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The ongoing project is focusing on the interpretative value of having a   life-size, three-dimensional rendering of the mission complex. Basically, people   need to have something tangible to see and interact with when they visit the   mission. While we can not accurately reconstruct or replicate Mission Dolores,   there is a feasible alternative. it is feasible to build a mission complex in   another nearby location By combining the available information from excavations   and historical research at Mission Dolores and Los Adaes with other sources, we   can build an authentic three-dimensional rendering or "simulation" of the   mission complex. A model for this simulation currently resides in the museum.   Architect Mark Wolf is using his expertise in the research of Spanish Colonial   vernacular architecture to spearhead the design phase of the Mission Dolores   replica project. </p>
              <p>Other current research associated with Mission Dolores includes the work of   Jeff Williams and Connie Hodges in locating and mapping segments of the Camino   Real in the area. Both are students of Jim Corbin&mdash;or &ldquo;Corbinites.&rdquo; Another   Corbinite, Carolyn Spears, Director of the Stone Fort Museum at SFA, has   organized several workshops for teachers and heritage managers that have   included a tour of Mission Dolores. Now that <EM>El Camino Real de los   Tejas</EM> is an operational National Historic Trail, there may be funds   available from the National Park Service for research projects along the trail.   For instance, Connie Hodges of the SFA Center for Regional Heritage Research has   conducted oral history interviews recently focusing on life and travel along the <EM>Camino Real de los Tejas</EM> from the Sabine River to the Angelina River as   part of the National Park Service grant that funded this online exhibit.</p>
              <H3><STRONG>Simulation Project</STRONG></H3>
              <p>Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia and New Salem Village in Illinois, among   others, are examples of reconstruction as the goal for the development of public   interpretive programs at archaeological sites. That is, do the archaeology and   then reconstruct the buildings&mdash;post for post&mdash;just the way they were recorded by   the archaeological investigations. Reconstruction as part of developing   archaeological sites for public interpretation is now frowned upon as being too   destructive of the remaining archaeological traces. ICOMOS (International   Council on Monuments and Sites) is very much against the reconstruction of   archaeological sites on both a national and international level. But back in the   1970s, reconstruction was the goal for archaeological investigations at Mission   Dolores that were sponsored by the San Augustine County Historical Society..   When the archaeological investigations revealed that much of the mission complex   had been destroyed, the sad reality that the mission could not be faithfully   reconstructed set in. This dawning realization was cause for much concern in the   1970s and 1980s. </p>
              <p>Happily, in 2008, a graduate student in the Historic Preservation program at   the University of Texas&mdash;Erin Tyson&mdash;proposed a viable alternative idea&mdash;a   &ldquo;simulation.&rdquo; That is, use the available archaeological and archival information   for Mission Dolores, combined with relevant archaeological, archival, and   ethnographic information from other Spanish Colonial period sites in Texas, and   come up with a reasonable model of what the Mission Dolores complex might have   looked like. The key would be to present the model to the public not as a   reconstruction or replication, but rather as a simulation. The goal is to   combine multiple lines of historical and archaeological evidence to be as   authentic as possible.</p>
              <p>Authenticity, however, sometimes goes against prevailing notions of what   structures in the past looked like. The initial interpretation of the Spanish   Colonial period domestic structures in the region was clouded by the idea that   many domestic structures built by Europeans long ago were log cabins or log   houses. While domestic structures built by Anglo-Americans in the 1800s in Texas   were indeed log cabins and log houses, this construction style was not practiced   by either the Spanish or the French during the 18th century in this area.   Nevertheless, a 1930s replication of Mission Tejas (west of Nacogdoches) was   built in the log cabin style, and a Spanish map of Los Adaes (near Natchitoches)   was altered to render the dwellings log cabin style. In contrast, a 1971 sketch   of Mission Dolores by San Augustine architect Raiford Stripling correctly   depicts the structures with vertical rather than horizontal lines. Such   structures are referred to as <EM>jacales</EM>, thatched-roof huts with walls   made of upright poles usually covered with mud (daub).</p>

        <H3><EM>Jacales</EM></H3>
        <p>The <EM>jacal</EM> has a simple design but one of extraordinary flexibility,   which allowed for an adaptation of construction techniques in response to the   variety of conditions faced by the Spanish and French across the great width and   breadth of Texas. <EM>Jacal </EM>is the Spanish adaptation of the Nahuatl word <EM>xahcalli</EM>, which described the domestic dwellings of the native people   of Central Mexico. <EM>Jacales</EM> were introduced to East Texas by the Spanish   and would have been built at Mission Dolores during its 1721-1773   occupation.</p>
        <p><BR>
          The best feature of the <EM>jacal</EM> was that it could be built with   limited construction knowledge using a variety of materials and with very few   tools. It could also be built quickly but could last for a very long time if   built properly and periodically maintained. Using natural building materials   readily at hand, the <EM>jacal</EM> could also be built inexpensively. &nbsp;Plus,   the <EM>jacal</EM> could be modified or added to with little effect or damage to   the original structure. &nbsp;No wonder it was such a popular building style!</p>
        <p><BR>
          The basic shape for the <EM>jacal</EM> was a single room of rectilinear   layout. &nbsp;Postcard image from the early 20th century give good visual examples of   the basic <EM>jacal</EM> framing. &nbsp;In most cases, the room was covered with a   gable roof frame. &nbsp;Thus structurally, the center of the narrower end walls would   have the tallest pole columns &ndash; usually with a &lsquo;Y&rsquo; of a branch at its top &ndash;   placed in the center of the wall line. &nbsp;A long ridge pole would be placed in the   notch of this branch &lsquo;Y&rsquo;, forming the peak of the roof. Posts of lesser heights   would then be placed at each corner of the room, with additional beam poles   placed at the top of the posts to form the low side of the roofline. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><BR>
          Posts were also placed at each side of any door or window opening for   stability. &nbsp;In most cases, the posts were placed into shallow holes especially   dug for each post. In the case of <EM>palisado</EM> wall construction, a trench   was dug along the length of the wall to support the ends of the vertical posts   placed next to each other to create a complete wall. </p>
        <p><BR>
          Archeologists look for signs of both of these conditions during   excavations, revealed as post molds or wall trenches marked by soil patterns   with a different and usually darker color or matrix. &nbsp;In some cases, these   trenches or post molds can also include cultural material (daub, charcoal,   pottery sherds) which can date or clarify occupation phases related to the   structure.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><BR>
          The space between vertical posts was filled with small rocks and mud or   lime chinking. &nbsp;Smaller, thinner branches would sometimes be placed vertically   between the framing pieces. These branches would also be placed horizontally.   Such methods created very substantial walls which would be finished with another   coat of daub, sometimes with a final a plaster coat on the more refined <EM>jacales</EM>.&nbsp;Aligned rocks possibly used as chinking or fill material in an   exterior wall have been observed in archaeological excavations at Mission   Dolores. Sometimes these infilled walls would simply be finished out with palm   fronds or with grasses similar to the roof construction. And sometimes the rooms   were simply open air and had no walls.</p>
        <p><BR>
          As is known from comparable 18th century Spanish missions, it is likely   that the church at Mission Dolores may have been a more substantial structure   than the simple <EM>jacales</EM> that would have been residences for the   priests, the two soldiers, and their families. The church at Mission San Sab&aacute;   appears to have been the most substantial building in the complex, surrounded by   what appear to be <EM>jacal</EM> type structures. The structures depicted on the   Los Adaes map which are located inside the presidio appear to have dressed   lumber frames and a smooth external appearance, while the houses surrounding the   presidio are described in 1768 as by Pierre Marie Fran&ccedil;ois de Pag&egrave;s, a French   visitor, as &ldquo;. . . around forty miserable houses, constructed with stakes driven   into the ground.&rdquo; Pag&egrave;s stayed in one of these houses and describes is as   follows, &ldquo;I went to sleep in the corner of his house, which by the bye, scarcely   deserved that name, for the roof was only supported by a sort of paling, the   greatest part of which had fallen to the ground from negligence and length of   time.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><BR>
          The houses at Los Adaes described by Pag&egrave;s were undoubtedly <EM>jacales, </EM>and this type of structure would also have been present at Mission Dolores.   Given the fact that Pag&egrave;s described the houses at Los Adaes as consisting of   vertical posts stuck in the ground, it is likely that these <EM>jacales</EM> were the <EM>palisado</EM> variety. At least one small structure identified   during the archaeological investigations at Mission Dolores on the basis of post   holes and wall trenches appears to be a <EM>palisado</EM>. The large pits filled   with refuse excavated at Mission Dolores originally may well have been pits   resulting from digging clay for making adobe blocks and for covering the <EM>jacal</EM> structures.</p>
        <p><BR>
          The same Spanish expedition that built the church and priest&rsquo;s residence   at Mission Dolores in 1721 also built the same structures at Los Adaes, so it is   likely that the building style is similar, if not identical. Unfortunately, we   have no surviving documents with precise descriptions of the mission church at   Mission Dolores. All that can be concluded with confidence is that the structure   was made of wood and not stone. Urrutia's drawing of the Los Adaes mission   complex shows a church and priest&rsquo;s residence forming part of the compound wall,   which appears to be a type of wooden fence. The simulation model for Mission   Dolores also uses the walls of one of the structures as part of the compound   walls based on Corbin&rsquo;s discovery of the traces of a wall trench and adobe block   building. The roofs of the buildings at Los Adaes are described as wood shingle   roofs. Pag&egrave;s also passed through Mission Dolores, but he makes no mention of   what he saw, possibly because there wasn&rsquo;t anything much different than what he   had seen at Los Adaes.&nbsp;</p>
        <BR>
        <H3>Mission Dolores Simulation Design</H3>
        <BR>
        <p>Wolf has designed a wonderful plan for a simulation at the Mission Dolores   Museum and Visitors Center. This simulation includes a mission complex,   agricultural fields, and an Ais village. The first thing that entering visitors   will see is the Ais village, followed by the agricultural field and then mission   complex. Wolf has proposed that the major architectural elements&mdash;the poles of   the buildings&mdash;be constructed of lightweight cast concrete and that the roofs and   infilling be authentic material. The art of casting lightweight concrete to   simulate wooden frameworks has been perfected by Carlos Cortes, a descendent of   an artist who made concrete castings of wooden objects in the 1920s that are   still on display today in San Antonio at the Palace of the Governors and at one   of the missions. &nbsp;The overall simulation will provide a visual rendering showing   of the relationship of the Spanish, the Ais, and the land.</p>
