          <td width="480" height="1539" valign="top"><p>The Spanish were the first Europeans to enter Deep East  Texas when the De Soto Expedition entered the area in 1542 under the command of  Luis de Moscoso following Hernando de Soto&rsquo;s death at the Mississippi River. Earlier interpretations of the route of this  expedition maintained that this group passed through what is now San Augustine,  but  most recent interpretations take Moscoso&rsquo;s route west of San Augustine,  passing through modern day Nacogdoches.  Moscoso and his group found no gold or silver, and while they left no  settlers behind, they did leave Spanish horses, hogs, and diseases. The immediate impact is unknown, but it is  likely that deadly Old World diseases began spreading among the native peoples  of East Texas, triggering social changes as Indian groups struggled to cope  with population loss.</p>
            <p>The French first visited the Cenis (Hasinai Caddo) area of  Deep East Texas during the occupation of La Salle's <strong><a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/stlouis/index.html">Fort St. Louis</a></strong>   (1685-1689) on the Gulf coast, but like the early Spanish explorers, their  trails were well to the west of San Augustine, close to the Neches River. </p>
            <p>The Ais Indians occupied the area around San Augustine but  it was the Hasinai to the west who invited the Spanish back into East  Texas. La Salle&rsquo;s failed attempt at  establishing a fort on the Gulf coast caught the attention of the Spanish, who  sent several unsuccessful expeditions to find the French fort. During one of these expeditions the Spanish  encountered a group of Hasinai who proclaimed themselves <em>tayshas</em> or allies (a  term which became Tejas and then Texas) and asked the Spanish to come settle in  their homeland of East Texas. This  invitation prompted the establishment of two Spanish missions in 1690, <em>San  Francisco de los Tejas</em>&mdash;located near modern-day Weches, Texas, and <em>Sant&iacute;simo  Nombre de Mar&iacute;a</em>, located on the Neches River, five miles to the east of San  Francisco. <em>Sant&iacute;simo Nombre de Mar&iacute;a</em> was  destroyed by a flood in 1692 and <em>San Francisco de los Tejas</em> was abandoned a  year later at the insistence of the local Hasinai after misbehavior by Spanish  soldiers and their cattle. Spanish soldiers  were making inappropriate advances to the Hasinai women and Spanish cattle  were wrecking havoc on Hasinai gardens.</p>
            <p>In the following decades, Father Francisco Hidalgo, formerly of  Mission San Francisco, was determined to return to  East Texas  and minister to the Tejas (Caddo) peoples.  In 1711 Hidalgo wrote what turned out to be an important letter to the  governor in French Louisiana, Antoine de la Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac. Father Hidalgo was disappointed that the Spanish  would not fund his return to East Texas, and he offered to introduce Cadillac  to Spanish traders in exchange for French support of his mission in East  Texas. Two letters were sent by courier  from Presidio San Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande and when one arrived in  Mobile, it was after the French had been rebuffed in their attempts to  establish trade relations with the Spanish at Vera Cruz&mdash;one French ship loaded  with trade goods had been seized by the Spanish on its way to Vera Cruz and the  ship was sent back to Louisiana without its cargo in 1710 because trade between  the French and New Spain was forbidden by the Spanish Crown.</p>
            <p>Cadillac instructed Louis Juchereau de St. Denis to try to  find Father Hidalgo. St. Denis had  visited the area of the Natchitoches Indians in 1700 and in 1713 he returned  there, established a trading post, and proceeded across the land of the Tejas  to Presidio San Juan Bautista. In  effect, the French had failed to establish trade relations through the &ldquo;front  door&rdquo; at Vera Cruz and so they tried again through the &ldquo;back door&rdquo; at San Juan  Bautista. St. Denis and his men were  arrested at Presidio San Juan Bautista by Commandant Diego Ramon and held under  house arrest. It has been suggested that  the families of Ramon and St. Denis had previous commercial relations, and  these relations were made more personal by Louis Juchereau marrying Mar&iacute;a  Manuella S&aacute;nchez de Navarro, the step granddaughter of Diego Ramon. It&rsquo;s not known if St. Denis ever found Father  Hidalgo, but Hidalgo&rsquo;s letter and St. Denis&rsquo;s travels to try to find him  resulted in the Spanish development of Texas.</p>
            <p>The Spanish-French interaction foretold the founding of  Mission Dolores.
