    <td width="480" height="1250" valign="top"><p>The ending of the French and Indian War in 1763 was a pivotal event for all of the French/Spanish borderlands in North America.  Just prior to the end of the conflict in 1762, when it was clear that the British would prevail, the French ceded all their  possessions west of the Mississippi River to their Spanish allies.   (New Orleans was also ceded to Spain, even  though it was just east of the Mississippi River.)    This cession prevented the British from gaining complete control of the  Mississippi River.   Since the post at  Natchitoches was now Spanish, inspections of the presidios and missions of the  province of Texas were undertaken to determine the necessity of maintaining  them now that the &ldquo;French threat&rdquo; had ended..</p>
      <p>The 1767 military inspection of the Marqu&eacute;s de Rub&iacute; at Presidio de los  Adaes came to the same conclusion that the Rivera inspection had reached 40 years earlier at  Presidio de los Tejas.   Even though  the soldiers at Los Adaes had proven their worth on various maneuvers during  the life of the presidio, there was clearly a lack of emphasis placed on  maintaining the defensive aspects of the presidio.   There had been, in fact, no real threat of a  French or American Indian attack, and since Fort St. Jean Baptiste had a more  strategic location on the Red River, there was no longer any need for Presidio   Los Adaes.</p>
      <p>One year after the 1767 military inspection, Mission Dolores and the other missions of  East Texas were inspected by Father Sol&iacute;s.    He observed no Indians living at any of the missions in East Texas and  that only 11 baptisms had been performed at Mission Dolores from 1721 to the time of  his1768 inspection.   Even though the  effort to congregate the Indians at the missions had failed, the tone of the Father's report  was  benevolent as he acknowledged that the missionaries were tending to the  spiritual needs of the soldiers and settlers of the area.    Like Rub&iacute;, Sol&iacute;s also recommended that all  the missions of East Texas be closed.</p>
      <p>The actual abandonment of the East Texas presidio and missions, including Mission Dolores, did not occur until 1773.   Since  the priests, soldiers, and settlers of this area were under the jurisdiction of  the presidio at Los Adaes, the Spanish colonists of the region came to be called Adaese&ntilde;os.   The Adaese&ntilde;os were initially led by Joseph  Gonzales in their exodus from the area, but he died on the trail from Los Adaes  to the Mission Dolores area.   After  Gonzales&rsquo; death, Antonio Gil Y&rsquo;Barbo took command.&nbsp;The Adaese&ntilde;os  continued on to San Antonio (see Los Adaes, the <a href="../adaes/final.html">Final Years</a>) and, soon after, petitioned to return to settle the  area around Mission Dolores.   This was   no coincidence,  Y&rsquo;Barbo had a ranch nearby called Lobonilla. </p>
      <p> The petition, however, was denied. Instead the  Adaese&ntilde;os were directed to settle on the Trinity River in modern Houston County  in 1774.   Comanche attacks and epidemics  caused the Adaese&ntilde;os to leave the settlement on the Trinity River, referred to  as <em>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar de Bucareli</em>. Instead they settled around the abandoned  Mission Guadalupe for the Nacogdoches.    Thus, the town of Nacogdoches was established in 1779 and the area  around former Mission Dolores was occupied by Spanish settlers.</p>
      <p>The tumultuous times between 1800 and 1814 resulted in a  much reduced Spanish population in East Texas.    After 1824  there was a large influx of Anglo settlers and by the  1830s the predominately Anglo settlement in the Mission Dolores area was referred to as the Ayish Bayou  Settlement.   The  town of San Augustine was established in 1833, and mention of the Old Mission  was made in descriptions of the land tracts including the town.   Today, the descendents of  old Spanish  families live in Nacogdoches County, but none  are now living  in the vicinity of the site of Mission Dolores.</p>
