          <td width="480" height="3342" valign="top"><p>Two and a half centuries ago the Spanish mission known as <EM>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora   de los Dolores de los Ais, </EM>or more simply, Mission Dolores, was a rather   forlorn way station on the far eastern branch of <EM>El Camino Real de los   Tejas</EM>, the royal Spanish road that ended some 50 miles farther east at <STRONG><A href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/adaes/index.html" target="_blank">Los   Adaes</A></STRONG>, the Spanish capital of 18th-century Texas. Today the site of   Mission Dolores lies within the modern town of San Augustine in East Texas about   35 miles east of Nacogdoches, and is on <A href="http://www.nps.gov/elte" target="_blank">El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail</A>. </p>
            <p>Translated, mission&rsquo;s full name &ldquo;Our Lady of Sorrows, for the Ais,&rdquo; evokes   its sorrowful story, that of a small frontier mission built in the 1720s for the   Ais Indians, the native group who lived along nearby Ayish Bayou. Like most of   the Spanish missions in the eastern area of the province of Tejas, Mission   Dolores failed to attract many Indian residents and was finally abandoned in   1773. Yet, while Mission Dolores did not accomplish its intended mission of   converting Native Americans to settled Christian citizens, it was a focal point   for a successful wilderness settlement for half a century. Here the resident   Spanish priests, soldiers and settlers interacted peacefully with many local   Indians, as well as the European and native peoples who traveled along El Camino   Real including French traders. There were few places in the American colonies   where different European and indigenous peoples managed to get along with one   another. This example of accommodation and acceptance of differences has   relevance for our society today. </p>
            <p>During the half century of the Mission&rsquo;s existence its frontier location on   the far eastern edge of New Spain meant that the closest sources of supplies and   interaction often came from the &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; &ndash; the French in Louisiana and the French   trading network among the Indians of East Texas. Such trade with the French was   forbidden by the Spanish Crown, yet the small group of padres and soldiers who   lived at Mission Dolores had no real choice. Although they were not able to   convince the Ais to stay for long at the mission, the local Indians did interact   quite willingly with the newcomers. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Mission life was punctuated from time to time by Spanish traffic along El   Camino Real: the coming and going of all-too-infrequent supply convoys, the more   common passing of Spanish soldiers, and the periodic visits by Spanish officials   heading to or from Los Adaes, the 18th-century capital of the province of Tejas.   Most of the time life was tranquil but trying, as the Spanish eked out an   existence on the remote frontier. Finally, time ran out and Mission Dolores was   abandoned along with the presidio and mission at Los Adaes and other East Texas   outposts as the Spanish pulled back to the concentration of forts and churches   at San Antonio.</p>
            <p>The succeeding centuries have not been kind to Mission Dolores. It quickly   fell to ruin after the Spanish left and was gradually swallowed by the piney   woods. In the late 1700s and early 1800s the Anglo settlers who moved into the   region from the Deep South had scant connection to the Spanish past. Yet   memories of the old Spanish mission lingered among the residents of the area,   some of whom were Spanish and Indian descendants, and were passed on to each   generation as physical traces of the place disappeared. By the mid 20th century   the precise location of Mission Dolores was uncertain, at least in the minds of   researchers.</p>
            <p>The location of Mission Dolores was never in question for the people of San   Augustine, as &ldquo;Mission Hill&rdquo; was place known to all who lived in the area. In   1845, James Perkins put the following warning in the local newspaper,   &ldquo;Caution!&mdash;This is to forewarn all persons from digging my land in and about the   Old Mission, as I will enforce the law against any person so offending.&rdquo; George   L. Crocket&rsquo;s 1932 history of San Augustine County mentions a &ldquo;quadrangular level   spot evidently artificial&rdquo; north of modern state highway 147 and also mentions   graves in the area with beads and pottery that were dug in the early 1920s. The   1936 Texas centennial marker for Mission Dolores was placed on Mission Hill and   the Camino Real marker&mdash;originally installed in 1918 next to the railroad tracks   was moved roughly 100 meters to be near the centennial marker. After the   centennial marker was installed, the people of San Augustine would spend the   next forty years trying to verify that Mission Hill was indeed the location of   Mission Dolores. </p>
            <p>As it turned out, the name Mission Hill wasn&rsquo;t quite right. The Spanish   mission had been located quite nearby, but not where legend had it. In the 1970s   archaeologists finally found what remained of the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; mission. Sadly, in   the early 20th century State Highway 147 had been built right through the   mission site, obliterating most of the direct evidence of its existence. Yet,   despite the highway, the establishment of the later town of San Augustine, and   other modern developments, important and informative physical traces of the   mission still exist and are being studied by researchers from Stephen F. Austin   University in Nacogdoches. Visitors today can learn more at the Mission Dolores   Museum and Visitors Center in San Augustine, Texas (see <A href="credits.html" target="_blank">Credits and Sources</A>).</p>
            <H3><STRONG>Setting</STRONG></H3>
            <p>The site of Mission Dolores is located in the Piney Woods of East Texas just   20 miles west of the Sabine River, which forms the Texas-Louisiana border.   &nbsp;Locally, the site lies 200 meters east of the Ayish Bayou on the west slope of   a prominent landform overlooking the first flood terrace of the bayou. Three   small springs that still flow all year are nearby. These springs probably played   a role in the choice of this particular spot for the mission, providing drinking   water and perhaps &nbsp;a source of water for irrigating crops. </p>
            <p align="left">Ayish Bayou, which takes its name from the Ais (or Ayish) Indians   for whom the mission was built, is a lengthy stream that flows into the Angelina   River, itself a tributary of the Neches River which joins the Sabine River just   before it drains into the Gulf of Mexico. The headwaters of the bayou are   located roughly seven miles north of San Augustine. Ayish Bayou, Attoyac Bayou,   and the Angelina River were dammed in the 1960s to form Sam Rayburn Reservoir. </p>
            <p align="left">Viewed in the continental perspective, Mission Dolores lies within   the Interior Coastal Plains, a topography characterized by parallel ridges and   valleys with geological beds comprised of unconsolidated sands and muds that are   tilted toward the Gulf of Mexico. The soils in this area are colloquially known   as red clay soils, although they are actually sandy clay loams. These soils   formed in place after continuous weathering of the underlying Weches Formation   bedrock &nbsp;and are generally well drained and relatively humus poor.</p>
            <p align="left">The soil in the immediate vicinity of the site is a red, fine   sandy loam overlying glauconitic clay containing thin layers of hard,   ferruginous (iron-like) concretions that serve as a substantial barrier to hand   excavation. Archaeologist Jim Corbin observed that the &ldquo;Spanish period postholes   almost never penetrated the petroferric zone&rdquo; and related this to the difficulty   of excavating the soils of Mission Dolores in dry condition. </p>
            <p align="left">Surface exposures of the Weches Formation bedrock are relatively   uncommon in the general vicinity, but they provide building materials where they   occur. The famous &ldquo;Stone Fort&rdquo; in Nacogdoches was built in the late 1700s out of   glauconitic sandstone blocks. A small outcrop of this sandstone occurs near the   Mission Dolores site.</p>
            <p>The natural vegetation of the San Augustine area includes mixed pine and   hardwood forests composed mainly of shortleaf and loblolly pine, southern red   oak and sweet gum trees. The area around the site was partially cleared by the   Spanish for the mission and its associated fields. Anglo settlers in the 1800s   completed the job, clearing much of the Ayish Bayou valley and leaving little of   the original forest vegetation. There is, however, a substantial stand of   Eastern red cedar near the mission site that surrounds the nearest spring east.   Historically, the area was called &ldquo;Cedar Hill,&rdquo; suggesting this is a natural   concentration. Cedar would have been used by the Spanish for building   timber.</p>
