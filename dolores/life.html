Although the  depiction does not reflect current thinking on the architectural style or  period clothing, it does give a good sense of daily life at the mission. </div>
<table width="780" border="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="480" height="1664" valign="top"><br><br>
    <p>Father Margil had placed Mission Dolores in the middle of  eight Ais settlements said to have been llocated within a three  mile radius of the mission and inhabited by a total of 80 families. The Ais came  to be proficient in the Spanish language and also in the use of French  firearms, and for a short time in the 1750s, some families actually lived at Mission  Dolores. For the most part, though, the  Ais lived in their own settlements and would visit the mission to help with the  crops. Occasional &quot;hour of  death&quot; baptisms were performed on dying Ais by the priests of Mission Dolores. Apparently, the priests were reluctant to  baptize Ais children because they were afraid that the children would not grow up  leading a Christian life. It also  appears that some of the Ais were afraid of the baptismal water, thinking that  it was the cause of death since it was often administered  just before  death.</p>
      <p>Two priests and one lay brother were assigned to Mission  Dolores, along with two soldiers and their families. The buildings included a church and  residences. Archaeological evidence suggests that one  building may have been an adobe block structure, and others represent <em><em>jacal</em></em> type structures. The people of Mission Dolores grew corn,  figs, garlic, onions and green vegetables of many kinds. A nearby ranch provided cattle, and cow bone  fragments are abundant at Mission Dolores.  Roughly 60% of the animal bone fragments are from European  domesticates&mdash;59% are from cattle and 1%  from sheep. Another 25% of the bone fragments are from  deer and the last 15% are from fish, reptile and small mammals. </p>
      <p>The French influence at Mission Dolores is undeniable in the  archaeological record. The ratio of  French to Spanish tin enameled earthenware is four to one. Fragments of French firearms have also been  recovered.  The French had a free trade policy with both  the Spanish and the Indians, but the Spanish Crown forbade the trade of merchandise  with the French (except food) and  forbade the trade of guns and alcohol to the Indians. In 1766, one of the priests assigned to  Mission Dolores testified that another priest who had been arrested for the  possession of French trade goods was handling such goods to entice the Indians  to come settle at his mission.</p>
      <p>Indian pottery fragments dominate the manufactured goods recovered from Mission Dolores.  It is likely than many of these fragments represent containers for Indian food stuffs, such as corn or bear fat, but table ware is also represented. Given the likelihood that few Ais actually lived at Mission Dolores, most of the aboriginal pottery must have been used by the mission’s Spanish inhabitants. </p>
      <p>The European artifacts recovered from  Mission Dolores give us glimpses into mission life including food preparation  and service, military armament, clothing, religious items, and even music, as  the following entries illustrate. </p>
      
      <br>
      <h3><strong>Preparing  the Meals</strong></h3>
      <p>Maize was a staple at the East Texas missions, and the <em>mano</em> and <em>metate</em> were   standard food processing tools in Spanish Colonial  households. The  Nauha Indians of  central Mexico ground their corn on rectangular shaped grinding stones called <em>metlatl</em>, which the Spanish interpreted  as <em>metate</em>. The Spanish used their own term&mdash;<em>mano</em>&mdash;for the stone you held in your hand  to grind against the <em>metate</em>. <em>Mano</em> means &ldquo;hand&rdquo; in Spanish.  Several <em>mano</em> fragments made of volcanic tuff were recovered  from Mission Dolores and were likely brought from Mexico. Similar grinding tools are still cherished by  some of the old Spanish families living along the Texas-Louisiana border  in the former eastern province of Spanish Tejas.</p>
      <p>A chocolate pot handle represents a popular drink among the  residents of the Spanish Colonial period habitations in East Texas. Chocolate is native to southern Mexico and  Central America, and become consumed widely in Europe in colonial times after being introduced from  the Americas. Chocolate appears in the  account ledgers of the soldiers of Los Adaes, along with <em>pilonsillo</em> or brown sugar, suggesting that the Spanish were  sweetening their chocolate.</p>
      <p>Fragments of both iron and copper alloy containers have been  recovered from Mission Dolores. These  were probably used in cooking, although it  is likely that Indian pottery vessels were also used in cooking, given the  large quantity of aboriginal ceramics, and the great distance from Spanish markets.</p>

    <p>You might expect the table of a Spanish mission priest or soldier to be set with tableware made in either Spain or Mexico, but in fact, there are four times as many fragments of French tableware as those made in Mexico at Mission Dolores, and no tableware from Spain has been recovered.  A small number of sherds are from tableware made in either Britain or Holland.  The only Spanish-made pottery  recovered from Mission Dolores are the sherds of olive jars, which contained either wine or olive oil.  Most of the European tableware is relatively expensive tin-enameled ware made in Europe and Mexico. Some less expensive lead-glazed ware from France and Mexico as well as British creamware  have also been found at Mission Dolores. </p>

			<p>The forks used at the dinner table at Mission Dolores would  have looked  much like the dinner forks of today. Two  dinner forks made of iron recovered during excavation have four tines that are blunted, in contrast to the sharp pointed two  and three tine forks used by the British in the early 18th  century. While the French used  four-tined forks in the early 18th century, it wasn&rsquo;t until the mid  18th century that four-tined forks become popular among the British.</p>

			<p>Candles were necessary to see what one was eating and  candles made prior to 1800 required a wick trimmer. A fragment of the handle of  a wick trimmer has been recovered at Mission Dolores. Candle wicks prior to 1800 were not  braided and  would therefore not burn to ash, but rather leave a long  glowing ember which had to be trimmed periodically to prevent a falling ember from   starting a fire. (Braided  wicks&mdash;which we still use today&mdash;burn completely  and do not present a fire  hazard.)&nbsp; </p>    </td>

  <p>The soldiers at Mission Dolores were horse soldiers whose  weapons typically included <em>escopetas</em>, short  swords, and lances. The <em>escopeta</em> was a short, smooth-bore shoulder  arm that had a flint lock mechanism and fired lead balls of generally .50 caliber  or less. It is interesting that the only  gun part fragments recovered from Mission Dolores are from a French weapon. &nbsp;Probable French gunflints have also been  recovered from Mission Dolores, but this is not too surprising as most of the  gunflints recovered at Los Adaes are French. </p>

    <p>Spanish Colonial horse gear was different in many ways from  either French or British horse gear. The  size of the rowel of the Spanish spurs was quite large&mdash;the example from  Mission Dolores would have been 15 cm or almost 6 inches in diameter. Small iron rods hung from both the saddle apron  and spurs, creating a jingling sound as the rider proceeded. Certain of these were actually charms  referred to as <em>higas</em> which would  protect against the evil eye. &nbsp;The Spanish ring bit was also quite different  from other European style bits in that the horse&rsquo;s lower jaw slipped through a  ring attached to the bit. Cuprous rollers were part of the bit where the horse&rsquo;s tongue touched the  ring. The rollers were thought to have a  taste which lessened the impact of the intrusion of the ring in the horse&rsquo;s  mouth.</p>

          <p>Documents tell us that the priests at Mission Dolores would  have worn long robes of rough cloth the color of faded blue jeans. A staff, sandals, and possibly a hat would  complete their outfit. The soldiers  probably wore a dark blue jacket and pants, with some sort of lower leg protectors  and shoes. The priests clothing  consisted almost exclusively of material that does not preserve in the  archaeological record, but the buttons and buckles from military clothing will  preserve. The only military button  recovered from Mission Dolores is French, and shoe buckle fragments have also  been recovered. </p>
          <p>
            Even though clothing does not generally preserve in the  acidic soils of East Texas, we can get an idea of the kind of cloth being used at the  mission through a lead cloth seal originally riveted to a bolt of cloth in  Europe and shipped to the Americas. Impressions  of the fabric are visible on the seal, showing that the bolt of cloth was of a  rather coarse weave. </p>
         
          <p>Necklace beads and seed beads of various colors have been  recovered from Mission Dolores. The seed  beads would have been sewn into clothing.  Fragments of cuprous containers were sometimes cut and rolled into  tinklers that would hang from the fringes of clothing and make a jingling sound  when the person walked about. The  presence of seed beads and tinklers is sometimes associated with historic  period American Indian occupations, but it is possible that these accessories  were being adopted by the people of the missions of East Texas as well.</p>

      <p>Only one artifact related to music has been recovered from  Mission Dolores&mdash;a broken mouth harp.  These instruments have a wide international distribution&mdash;in 18th  century England they were referred to as Jew&rsquo;s harps although it appears that they  had nothing to do with either Judaism or the Jews in England. The Spanish referred to these instruments as <em>birimbao</em> or <em>guimbarda</em>. Mouth harps are  fairly common at Spanish and French colonial military sites&mdash;six have been  recovered from Los Adaes and 122 have been recovered at the French Fort  Michilimackinac, located in Michigan.</p></td>

        There are relatively few military artifacts represented in the  Mission Dolores archaeological collections, but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no religious  artifacts. There are no crucifixes or  religious medallions&mdash;of course the altar accoutrements would have been removed  when the mission was abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;The only  artifacts related to belief in something beyond the physical are the <em>higas</em>, mentioned earlier as horse gear. Two <em>higas</em> made of jet represent items of personal adornment.  </p></td>
