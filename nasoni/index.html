                  <br>
                  <p class="text">When French and Spanish explorers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ventured into the Southeast and the area that is now Texas, they passed through many communities of Caddo peoples. Their accounts tell of peaceful hunting and farming folk led by stately chieftains, villages with thatch-covered houses, and patchworks of fields planted with crops. Some of the travelers saw large flat-topped mounds topped with structures, dominating the landscape like small hills. Although elaborate ceremonies were conducted from their lofty heights, after ca. A.D. 1691 the mounds no longer saw the cycles of building and renewal that had marked earlier times. By the time of continuous contact between Europeans and Caddo peoples in the late 17th century, the mound-building tradition had effectively ceased.
                    <br>
					  <br>
					In the country of the Caddo, the Spanish and French competed fiercely for the loyalty of the native peoples. Enterprising French traders established posts among the Kadohadacho and Hasinai groups and set up a lucrative exchange, trading guns, glass beads, kettles, metal tools for scraping animal hides, and horses provided by the Native Americans. Spanish priests, finding the people to be &quot;peaceful, gentle, and jovial,&quot; established missions among the more southerly Hasinai peoples with the intent of assimilating and converting the Native Americans and using them as a bulwark against French encroachment. While the Spanish offered only religion&#151;which the Caddo already had&#151;the French brought the much more desired objects: guns. </p>
                    
                  
                  <p class="text">At the Great Bend of the Red River were the 
                    villages of the Upper Nasoni Caddo, a name appended to both 
                    the people and the location by the French. This sprawling 
                    community&#151;some have estimated it stretched for more than 
                    8 kilometers in length&#151;saw its share of Anglo-European 
                    visitors. Remnants of the De Soto expedition may have passed 
                    through as early as 1542, followed by Henri Joutel in 1687. 
                    The Teran expedition, led by Domingo Teran de los R&iacute;os, 
                    traveled through in 1691-1692. </p>
                  <p class="text">Significantly for researchers today, a detailed 
                    map of the village was generated from that latter venture. 
                    As shown above, it depicts dispersed clusters of small farmsteads, 
                    each containing several buildings, ramadas for shelter, and 
                    above-ground granaries. On the west side of the village, there 
                    is a mound shown with a structure marked &quot;Temple,&quot;and 
                    near the center, the house of the Caddi, or chief. </p>
					
                  <p class="text">Some 30 years after Teran passed through the 
                    community, French trader Jean-Baptiste Benard, Sieur de La 
                    Harpe set up a small trading post among the Upper Nasoni people people in the area of the Roseborough Lake site (41BW5). 
                    He had been warmly welcomed by a delegation of chiefs, and 
                    in short measure, a relationship was established. In exchange 
                    for the European goods that La Harpe brought, the villagers 
                    provided a choice spot for his concession on the lands of 
                    the chief. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Frenchman found the locale and people exemplary: 
                    &quot;<i>&#133;the country is fine, the earth black, and the 
                    prairies most beautiful and fertile</i>.&quot; Men and women 
                    worked the fields, growing corn, beans, watermelons, sunflowers, 
                    and other small crops. They hunted the verdant woods and prairies, supplementing their diet with wild foods and game. They crafted distinctive pottery vessels, some artfully decorated with engraved and trailed spiral designs and animal-headed handles on effigy bowls. And they engaged in trade with the Europeans. But this way of life was to change drastically, as the native peoples were afflicted with diseases carried by the newcomers. With cruel rapidity, the village population diminished. In 1806, members of the Freeman-Custis expedition, who were surveying lands for the Louisiana Purchase, traveled past the Upper Nasoni village and found it abandoned. </p>
                  <p class="text">Roughly 125 years later, archeologists from 
                    the University of Texas-Works Progress Administration program 
                    began excavations at a large mound on the Northeast Texas 
                    farm of Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Hatchel. At the mound and in the 
                    adjacent fields, they unearthed a complex record of occupations 
                    spanning more than 650 years. A cemetery containing more than 
                    60 graves from several periods of use as well as remains of village areas were investigated 
                    on sites nearby. Because this cemetery was being looted when 
                    the work began, the WPA archeologists thought it best to salvage 
                    what information they could. The locale, known to archeologists 
                    as the Hatchel-Mitchell-Eli-Moores complex, came to be recognized 
                    as one of the most important Caddo sites in Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">But the mound and its surrounding village areas 
                    were to take on a greater significance. Through the painstaking 
                    research of ethnohistorian Mildred Mott Wedel and others, 
                    this enormous archeological complex was identified as the 
                    Upper Nasoni village visited by the early travelers and known 
                    previously only through their records, maps, and drawings. 
                    There La Harpe had traded his wares on the land of the chief; 
                    on the mound had stood the awesome structure where religious 
                    and political leaders conducted their rituals. By poring over original documents 
                    (rather than poorly made translations) and ground-testing 
                    distances recorded by La Harpe, Wedel was able to link the 
                    location of the village to the historic documents. With this 
                    critical correlation, we are now able to examine late-period 
                    evidence from the archeological site in the context of those 
                    historic accounts, providing a much fuller and richer image 
                    of the Upper Nasoni village as it neared its demise.</p>

                    excavations at the site through a gallery of archival photos 
                    from that undertaking. </p>
