            <p class="text">Established in 1862 as a training camp for new Texas 
              Confederate recruits, Camp Ford was to have its mission dramatically 
              altered in barely a year's time. Union forces began to press the 
              Texas-Louisiana border and along the coastline near Galveston and, 
              in the ensuing actions, hundreds of Union soldiers were captured. 
              With no Confederate POW camp near at hand, Camp Ford was chosen 
              to receive the detainees. The first Federal POWs&#151;fewer than 
              100 soldiers and sailors&#151;arrived there in July 1863 to find 
              that few provisions had been made for their confinement. Many of 
              the prisoners constructed crude dugouts in the hill slopes to provide 
              themselves shelter; Confederate guards encircling the perimeters 
              of the small encampment served as the only deterrent to escape.</p>
            <p class="text">Arrival of more than 400 POWs in the following November 
              led to the construction of a log stockade that enclosed three acres 
              and a springfed creek. Within a 10-day period, a wood stockade was 
              raised using the labor of some 600 African-American slaves, pressed 
              into service from area plantations. Records suggest that captured 
              African American soldiers and sailors, who were not recognized as 
              POWs, were used as well as. POWs built their own living quarters&#151;typically 
              log houses called &quot;<i>shebangs</i>&quot;&#151;inside the stockade. 
              One prisoner housed in the original stockade described the bleak 
              encampment as: &quot;&#133;four acres-barren of timber and grass. 
              Sand blows desperately.&quot; </p>
           
            <p class="text">Following several defeats of Union forces in Louisiana 
              and Arkansas during the spring of 1864, more than 4,000 Union soldiers 
              were captured. Orders were issued to accommodate a new influx of 
              prisoners at Camp Ford. Over a two- or three-day period, several 
              hundred slaves labored to enlarge the stockade to encompass a 10- 
              to 16-acre area.</p>
            <p class="text">Although living conditions in the camp had been comparatively 
              good when the prisoners numbered only 100 to 250 per acre, they 
              deteriorated after April, 1864, when 400 or more men became crowded 
              into each acre of the newly enlarged camp. One prisoner wrote that, 
              soon after their arrival, the new POWs began to &quot;arrange their 
              bivouacs into streets and began to amass green boughs for wigwams 
              or dig dark cavernous vaults for troglodytic dwellings.&quot; The 
              camp, he wrote, soon took on the aspect of a &quot;wigwam metropolis.&quot; 
              Given the slope of the terrain, periodic rainstorms frequently turned 
              the encampment in a muddy and gully-ridden quagmire.</p>

              and dugouts. Note that, according to map key, housing was according 
              to mess assignment.</div>
        
            <p class="text">During the final years of its short-lived existence, 
              Camp Ford took on a more orderly appearance, what one prisoner described 
              as resembling &quot;a very young prairie town.&quot; Streets were 
              laid out and lined with log structures, a parade ground was cleared, 
              and a market place under a pine-bough arbor was established. </p>
            <p class="text">Even so, boredom and a desire for freedom apparently 
              occupied the minds of many of the prisoners. Escape attempts, via 
              numerous furtively dug tunnels, met with varying success. In one 
              foiled attempt, a tunnel was dug at an excruciatingly slow pace 
              by a prisoner wielding only a small case knife; dirt was dumped 
              into a cigar box which was drawn out by a string. The tunnel had 
              reached 30 feet when the escape plot was discovered. In a more-successful 
              attempt, men from Massachusetts and Indiana managed to complete 
              a tunnel and head out in small squads bound for points north and 
              east. However, one of the last men in the tunnel got stuck and, 
              in a panic, alerted the guards. Due to the early warning, all but 
              two squads were recaptured. </p>
            <p class="text">With the end of the war in May 1865, Camp Ford was 
              abandoned. Historical records attest to considerable celebration 
              by POWs and guards alike, and to a large rummage sale in which the 
              newly-freed prisoners sold what few goods they had to local citizens 
              in need of utensils, dishes, and various items that had been made 
              by the prisoners.</p>
            <p class="text">In the ensuing years, several prisoners were to return 
              to Camp Ford to challenge old ghosts and recall lost friends. In 
              1894, S.A. Swanger visited the old stockade where he had been imprisoned. 
              Walking over the ground, he found prison relics, the remains of 
              red clay dugouts, cattle bones, and&#151;in the cemetery area&#151;a 
              few other bones, perhaps overlooked when the Federal government 
              disinterred the bodies of 286 Union prisoners after the war. Before 
              leaving, he took a last drink from the spring and a final look at 
              the hillside. He wrote later, &quot;Farewell, old spot. And feeling 
              as if I never wanted to gaze upon it again, I left it&#133;.&quot;</p>
