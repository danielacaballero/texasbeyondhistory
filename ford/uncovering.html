                  <p class="text">During the summer of 1997, archeologists from 
                    the Center for Ecological Archaeology (CEA) at Texas A&amp;M 
                    University conducted exploratory investigations at Camp Ford. 
                    Given the long history of impacts to the site&#151;farming 
                    and mechanical plowing, reforestation, highway construction, 
                    the development of a swimming pool, and the ravages of relic 
                    hunters&#151;efforts were remarkably successful. Backhoe excavations 
                    and ground penetrating radar revealed well-preserved trenches, 
                    pits, and house floors representing the remains of stockade 
                    wall trenches, refuse pits, and various types of residential 
                    structures.</p>
                  <p class="text">Fieldwork began with a surface survey that identified 
                    the locations of both the original stockade walls and the 
                    later expansion. Exploratory excavations revealed more than 
                    70 archeological features, including 22 exposures of wall 
                    trenches and six drainage ditches along all four sides of 
                    the original stockade and along the south and east walls of 
                    the expanded stockade. In addition, 19 house floors, 13 small 
                    refuse pits, and five latrines were recorded.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Within the stockade area are the well-preserved 
                    remains of hundreds of structures similar to those depicted 
                    or inferred from Civil War era pictorial records of Camp Ford. 
                    Structures include flat-floored cabins, dugouts more than 
                    4 feet below the surface on hillsides, and pithouses with 
                    basin-shaped floors. We found several hints of the historically 
                    reported reservoirs along the spring-fed creek that were used 
                    to obtain drinking water, to bathe, and to wash clothes.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Several posthole molds were encountered adjacent 
                    to the stockade walls, and these may represent the locations 
                    of guard stations along the wall. We also have the remains 
                    of what may be a pithouse just outside the stockade wall near 
                    the southwest corner where the guards' quarters were located.</p>
                  <p class="text">Surface survey work and limited screening of 
                    backhoe trench backdirt resulted in the recovery of numerous 
                    artifacts. These include bone and wooden items made by the 
                    prisoners, fragments of metal cooking vessels, glassware, 
                    and pieces of ceramics among them, a terracotta-like ware 
                    made by the POWs. </p>
                  <p class="text">The artifacts and faunal remains, together with 
                    the identified features, present a poignant reminder of Camp 
                    Ford's POWs and guards, as well as slaves and citizens. Collectively, 
                    they illustrate the interconnectedness of these diverse cultural 
                    groups and their distinctive roles during the Civil War.</p>
                  <p class="text">Much of the work in bringing the Camp Ford project 
                    to fruition has come from local volunteers, particulary through 
                    the more than 50-year effort of the Smith County Historical 
                    Society. An interpretive center planned for the site of Camp 
                    Ford will utilize what was learned through archeological investigations. 
                    The actual layout of the camp at different time periods, as 
                    revealed in archival maps and records and supported by excavations, 
                    will be one aspect of this interpretation. Artifacts recovered 
                    in excavations also will be on display at the center. </p>
