			<p class="text">In the Piney Woods of East Texas, a lone historical 
              marker on a busy highway denotes the site of a ramshackle stockade 
              where, during the last years of the Civil War, some 6000 Union prisoners, 
              Confederate guards, and African-American slaves lived, worked, and 
              variously made their mark on the history of the area. In 1997, when 
              archeologists from Texas A&amp;M set about to explore Camp Ford, 
              only the faint impressions of trenches, drainage ditches and berms, 
              along with a few pieces of rotting wood, were visible on the ground 
              surface. But by using a battery of archeological and historical 
              research techniques, they were able to uncover Camp Ford and begin 
              to tell its little-known story. What they learned will be used in 
              creating an interpretive center and display for visitors at the 
              site of Camp Ford.</p>
            <p class="text">
              Located in Smith County near Tyler, Texas, Camp Ford was closely 
              tied to support operations for Confederate forces west of the Mississippi 
              River during the Civil War.  This part of Northeast Texas became a military-industrial complex 
              for the Confederacy's Trans-Mississippi Department, serving as both 
              a headquarters area and a critical manufacturing center for guns, 
              ammunition, and other war supplies.</p>
            <p class="text">The camp was named for John Salmon &quot;Rip&quot; 
              Ford, the colorful lawyer-doctor-ranger who served briefly as state 
              conscript commander charged with the responsibility for enlisting 
              and training soldiers for the Confederacy. Initially, the camp was 
              home to new recruits and draftees for Texas regiments. By the middle 
              of the war, its character had begun to change dramatically, and 
              it became the largest camp for Union prisoners of war west of the 
              Mississippi. (See Timeline for a chronology of key events at Camp 
              Ford and in other states during the Civil War). <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text">This change coincided with the decline of the military 
              fortunes of the Confederacy. With the fall of New Orleans and Vicksburg, 
              Mississippi, to Union land and naval forces, the Trans-Mississippi 
              Department became isolated from the rest of the South. Texas increasingly 
              had to look after its defenses and its supplies as best it could. 
              Attempted Union invasions along the Texas coast and up the Red River 
              from Louisiana brought the war closer to home. And it brought more 
              prisoners to Camp Ford.</p>
            <p class="text">The U.S. soldiers imprisoned at the camp were not 
              the only newcomers brought to the area by the war. As large portions 
              of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri came under the control of U.S. 
              forces, the region became a destination for civilian refugees, white 
              and black. In these respects, Camp Ford serves as a microcosm of 
              the war as it was experienced &quot;behind the lines.&quot;</p>
