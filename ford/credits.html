    <p class="text">The Camp Ford webpage was adapted from reports authored by 
      <strong>Alston V. Thoms</strong>, who directed the archeological excavations at the site 
      in 1997. Additional text, including the Camp Ford/Civil War Timeline, was 
      written by TBH Co-Editor <strong>Susan Dial</strong> and Contributing Editor <strong>Steve Dial</strong>.    </p>
      <p class="text">Dr. Alston Thoms is a rofessor of anthropology 
        at Texas A&amp;M University. His research 
        interests are in the archeology of western North America, especially land-use 
        practices, tool-stone and cook-stone technology, and cultural resources 
        management. His fieldwork in Texas spans more than 30 years, during which 
        time he has worked closely with avocational archeologists, Native American 
        groups, Civil War enthusiasts, and local historical organizations. Thoms 
        is a fifth-generation Texan whose archeological interests date to his 
        grade-school days in the Texas Panhandle when his father taught him how 
        to find Indian campsites around playa lakes and along draws.</p>
      <p class="text">He graduated in 1970 from what was then West Texas State 
        University with a degree in history and a minor in anthropology. Thoms 
        was a Peace Corps volunteer in Brazil for three years before entering 
        graduate school at Texas Tech University. He earned an M.A. in anthropology 
        from Texas Tech in 1978. He spent the 1980s in the Pacific Northwest, 
        obtaining his Ph.D. in anthropology from Washington State University and 
        directing several large-scale field projects. In 1990, he moved back to 
        Texas and accepted a position at Texas A&amp;M University where he continues 
        to teach and conduct field projects with his students. </p>
      <p class="text">The Smith County Historical Society has been instrumental 
        in preservation efforts at Camp Ford for more than 50 years. Their testing 
        of the site in the 1980s and 1990s helped demonstrate the intact nature 
        of the deposits, and they were a critical source in securing the funding 
        that enabled the full investigation of the site. In addition, the society 
        has worked diligently in pursuit of a final goal, a permanent visitors 
        center and interpretive museum at the site. </p>
