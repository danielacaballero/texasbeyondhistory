                        <div class="caption">Room 25, with Bob Smith for scale, 
                          is another deep pithouse with stepped entry, a hearth 
                          and four roof supports. It took over two years to excavate 
                          this structure and unravel the sequence of events. The 
                          upper part of the room had been filled with trash from 
                          the pueblo occupants, and the pueblo eventually extended 
                          over this room. The trash deposit ended with a layer 
                          of caliche. Across most of the site, caliche occurs 
                          as a sterile, natural layer below most features or served 
                          as the bottom for pits and some room floors. At first 
                          we thought that the caliche layer in Room 25 was natural 
                          and quit digging. However, the large and rectangular 
                          shape to the trash deposit was puzzling because it did 
                          not resemble other situations of trash disposal at the 
                          site. So, another one-meter square was dug and luckily 
                          encountered one of the neatly plastered pithouse room 
                          corners. It turns out that this deep pithouse had been 
                          intentionally filled with caliche. </div>

                  <p class="text">One of the big surprises at Firecracker was 
                    the discovery of 17 pithouses&#151;semi-subterranean structures 
                    built within pits. Although pithouses are common at earlier 
                    Jornada sites, they were not expected at this very late site. 
                    Expected or not, it is now apparent that a small pithouse 
                    village or hamlet consisting of two groups of pithouses (that 
                    may not be contemporaneous) existed immediately prior to the 
                    construction of the pueblo. Many of the pithouses had been 
                    cut into by later features, and many had trash dumped in them. 
                    Some were also found beneath the pueblo room block. Various 
                    lines of evidence suggest that the pithouses and pueblo were 
                    built by late El Paso phase peoples in rapid succession, probably 
                    by the same social group. The pithouses are suspected to represent 
                    the initial period of intermittent and probably seasonal use 
                    of the site. </p> 
                  <p class="text">Most pithouses at Firecracker were in pits only 
                    15-25 cm below ground surface, but some floor depths ranged 
                    to over a meter below the surface. With the exception of two 
                    structures that may have shared a common wall, the pithouses 
                    were single rooms. The pithouse rooms tended to be rectangular, 
                    fairly narrow, and had relatively small floor areas ranging 
                    from about 6 to 11 square meters. Floors were plastered with 
                    caliche, and caliche or mud plaster was still present on some 
                    pit walls. Above ground, the walls were probably at least 
                    partially made of adobe, although definite evidence of this&#151;narrow 
                    wall stubs&#151;was found for only one of these structures. 
                    Substantial roof supports were apparently not needed for the 
                    narrow, rectangular pithouses, as only two of them had two 
                    main roof supports. </p>
                  <p class="text"> In contrast, three out of the four pithouses 
                    that were more or less square had roof supports. Two had 2 
                    postholes and a third had 4. The fourth square pithouse was 
                    poorly preserved. Materials used for beams and roofs were 
                    the same as for the pueblo, except for the absence of juniper 
                    and cottonwood, possibly because the major roof supports and 
                    roof beams had been removed from the abandoned pithouses and 
                    reused to build the pueblo.</p>
                  <p class="text">Three of the shallow pithouses had doorways 
                    in their south walls. Stepped entryways were discovered through 
                    the south walls of two pithouses and the north wall of a third 
                    structure. Five of the six observed entryways had a plastered 
                    hearth near the opening; the sixth had no hearth. In pithouses 
                    with hearths, 11 hearths were near the center of the south 
                    wall, three near the east wall, and one each near the north 
                    and west walls. Because the hearths occurred in different 
                    places within the pithouses, it is inferred that the direction 
                    of the entryways also varied. Two pithouses lacked plastered 
                    hearths, and a third structure was poorly preserved.</p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the pithouse rooms are of similar size 
                    and have hearths and other similar floor features. Although 
                    the pithouses are generally smaller than the surface pueblo 
                    rooms, these seem to be household dwellings that sometimes 
                    also served as storage rooms. The most convincing example 
                    of a storage room was a burned pithouse that contained considerable 
                    quantities of corn and beans. Another pithouse was tiny and 
                    had a floor area of only 1.3 square meters. It had a stepped 
                    entry on the north side, lacked floor features, and did not 
                    have a plastered floor but was excavated into a caliche layer. 
                    As with the small rooms associated with the pueblo, this structure 
                    probably served as a storage &quot;closet.&quot; Another pithouse 
                    of average size, without a hearth or other notable floor features, 
                    and excavated nearly a meter into the soil likely served as 
                    a storage structure.</p>
                  <p class="text">The largest of the pithouses, Room 31, is unusual 
                    in having numerous floor pits and a large hearth area on the 
                    floor that was not contained within a plastered pit or ring 
                    (the usual practice). It also had an alignment of posts in 
                    the western third of the structure, a large antechamber or 
                    step entry, and what appeared to be a wall or screen between 
                    the main part of the structure and the antechamber. It is 
                    twice the size of any of the other pithouses and located away 
                    from the other pithouses in the eastern part of the site. 
                    Although not as large as the pueblo rooms considered to be 
                    ceremonial or communal rooms, it obviously had a special function 
                    as well.</p>
                  <p class="text">Two groups of pithouses were present at Firecracker. 
                    Four shallow pithouses formed a rough square in the southern 
                    part of the site. These structures faced one another and the 
                    central area between them. Plastered hearths and presumably 
                    nearby doorways, were located on the walls facing the central 
                    area. The second group is a linear alignment of 11 pithouses 
                    that is oriented east-west and is located mostly west of the 
                    pueblo room block. Almost all of the pithouses in this group 
                    had hearths centered on south walls. The four identifiable 
                    doorways or step entries are also through south walls. The 
                    linear arrangement and orientation of the 11 pithouses parallels 
                    that of the pueblo room block of Firecracker Pueblo and other 
                    pueblos of the region.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the Southwest, pithouses are often associated 
                    with short-term, seasonal, and intermittent occupation. A number 
                    of observations suggest that this was the case at Firecracker 
                    as well. First, the pithouses are not substantial in construction 
                    and are small in comparison to pueblo rooms, suggesting that 
                    they were not designed to be lived in for long. Second, trash 
                    areas and other features outside the pueblo were clearly associated 
                    with the pueblo occupation rather than the pithouses. Third, 
                    one pithouse had a second floor added after some period of 
                    absence, as might be expected in seasonally occupied rooms. 
                    Finally, a number of cached objects were found in two pithouses, 
                    including metates, manos, pestles, and a mortar. These are 
                    heavy tools that were probably left behind with the intent 
                    of return.</p>
                  <p class="text">Prior to the fieldwork at Firecracker Pueblo, 
                    pithouses had not been recorded for the El Paso phase. Not 
                    long after the first pithouses were uncovered at Firecracker, 
                    other pithouses and isolated or ephemeral structures began 
                    to be recognized in the region. Unlike Firecracker Pueblo, 
                    no more than four pithouses or isolated structures were reported 
                    for any of these other sites.</p>
                  <p class="text">The large number of pithouses excavated at Firecracker 
                    Pueblo raises the question of whether they represent a single 
                    occupation or multiple occupations. While it is likely that 
                    the structures within each of the two groups of pithouses 
                    were contemporaneous, it is uncertain if both groups were 
                    occupied at the same time. It is also possible that not all 
                    structures in the larger, east-west oriented group were occupied 
                    at the same time. Nevertheless, there was little or no lapse 
                    in time between the pithouse and pueblo occupations. The deeper 
                    pithouses and those closest to the pueblo had trash dumped 
                    in them and resting directly on the floors. The pithouse located 
                    farthest to the east, and beneath a pueblo room, had been 
                    occupied long enough for walls to be darkened by smoke and 
                    then the two primary posts were removed and the walls knocked 
                    down to fill in the structure. Immediately above this pithouse, 
                    one of the first rooms of the pueblo was built with a post 
                    and hearth pattern matching that of the lower pithouse. It 
                    seems likely that the roof support posts and beams from the 
                    underlying pithouse were reused to construct the pueblo room, 
                    and the occupants of both structures were one and the same. 
                    The shared alignment of the east-west pithouses and the pueblo 
                    is another indication that the shift from the pithouses to 
                    the pueblo occurred quickly.</p>
