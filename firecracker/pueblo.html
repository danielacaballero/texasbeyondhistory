				<br>
                  <p class="text">When the Firecracker investigations began, it 
                    was assumed that Firecracker Pueblo would prove to be like 
                    many other pueblos of the Jornada region. By 1980 when excavations 
                    began, a total of nearly 300 rooms had been excavated from 
                    over two dozen Jornada pueblo sites. In general, these rooms 
                    are relatively large in size, have hearths near the center 
                    of southern or exterior walls, and various patterns of postholes 
                    left by roof support posts. Pueblo rooms usually have the 
                    same features regardless of whether the site contains one 
                    or over 100 rooms. Smaller rooms often have two primary roof 
                    supports along the east-west axis of rooms, and larger rooms 
                    frequently have four primary roof supports located toward 
                    room corners. About one out of every six to ten rooms is much 
                    larger than the others and usually has multiple floor features 
                    including two hearths and other small pits along the north-south 
                    axis. These are thought to have served a special function 
                    as suggested by the names applied to them: kivas, communal 
                    rooms, and clan rooms. While some of the largest pueblos have 
                    rooms arranged around a central plaza, the majority of Jornada 
                    pueblo sites consist of one or more room blocks oriented east-west 
                    with a single or sometimes a double tier of rooms. </p> 
                  <p class="text">The Firecracker excavations revealed a pueblo 
                    with the expected architectural details, although it proved 
                    to be larger than foretold by the surface evidence. The pueblo 
                    consisted of 15 to 17 rooms in a one- to two-room-wide, linear, 
                    east-west room block. The exact number of rooms is uncertain 
                    because the walls and floors in the west central portion of 
                    the pueblo were badly eroded. The walls were made of coursed 
                    adobe, while the floors were plastered caliche.The roofs were 
                    probably made of a combination of materials including wood, 
                    grass thatch, adobe, and mud plaster. Most rooms ranged in 
                    size from 8 to 20 square meters, had hearths near the center 
                    of the south wall, and possessed two primary postholes. The 
                    largest room is probably a communal room and had four primary 
                    postholes, two hearths and small pits along the north-south 
                    axis, and a floor area of 54 square meters. </p>
                  <p class="text">Secondary postholes and miscellaneous pits were 
                    encountered in some of the rooms. Posts and beams were of 
                    juniper and cottonwood, and secondary posts and smaller beams 
                    were of mesquite. Roof materials included mesquite, dropseed 
                    grass, reed, and stalks of yucca, agave, and sotol. There 
                    was little evidence of modification or maintenance of rooms, 
                    suggesting that the pueblo was not long-lived. The construction 
                    of the pueblo had begun with a core of two or four rooms, 
                    and then more rooms were added to the east and west. Relatively 
                    few artifacts were found on the floors, suggesting that Firecracker 
                    Pueblo was abandoned in an unhurried manner.</p>
                  <p class="text">Excavations outside of the room block led to 
                    the discovery of a tiny room against the south side of the 
                    pueblo. It had an unplastered floor and lacked floor features. 
                    A similar room was located 8 meters south of the center of 
                    the pueblo room block. Its position above an earlier structure 
                    and several outside features suggested that it belonged to 
                    the same occupation as the pueblo room block. These &quot;closets&quot; 
                    were probably used for storage. Previous excavations in the 
                    Jornada region have rarely encountered such rooms, no doubt 
                    because most work has focused exclusively on the pueblo rooms 
                    proper.</p>
                  <p class="text">Excavation outside the pueblo also led to the 
                    finding of an isolated room that was at the western edge of 
                    the site. Certain of its construction details and associated 
                    artifacts suggest that it is contemporary with the pueblo 
                    room block. This room differed from earlier structures in 
                    that it was nearly square in plan, had square corners and 
                    substantial adobe walls, was not superimposed by other structures 
                    or features, and was not trash-filled. This room had a floor 
                    area of 9.4 square meters, no primary roof support, a sealed 
                    hearth near the center of the east wall, and another hearth 
                    near the center of the south wall. Although not common, isolated 
                    rooms have been reported for other Jornada pueblos.</p>

                          It is over 50 square meters in size or about four times 
                          larger than an average habitation room. It also has 
                          multiple features, including several hearths on the 
                          north-south axis and four primary roof supports. Like 
                          Room 1, there are alignments of secondary posts that 
                          either supported roof beams or a bench or platform.
