                  <p class="text">Firecracker Pueblo's setting in the northern 
                    Chihuahuan Desert and its relatively recent date&#151;less 
                    than 600 years old&#151;allowed the survival of many organic 
                    remains: burned and unburned wood, grass, stalks, wild and 
                    cultivated seeds, animal bones, and various other items. These 
                    organic remains have provided important information on the 
                    diet and lifestyle, construction methods, and the age of the 
                    site. The construction techniques are discussed in the <a href="pueblo.html" class="text">Pueblo</a> 
                    and <a href="pithouses.html" class="text">Pithouses</a> sections. 
                    Here we concentrate on the age of the site and its economy. 
                  </p> 
                  <h3>The Age of the Site</h3>
                  <p class="text">From the pottery types present at the site and 
                    other characteristics, we knew that Firecracker Pueblo was 
                    a fairly late site. The generally accepted age of the El Paso 
                    phase was A.D. 1200-1400 and it was expected that radiocarbon 
                    assays would place the site near the end of that period. Instead, 
                    most of the dates fell within the fifteenth century.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the Southwest, wood is not the preferred 
                    material for radiocarbon dating because of the &quot;old wood&quot; 
                    problem. Simply stated, the dry conditions mean that wood 
                    can last several hundred years or more in some circumstances, 
                    particularly at residential sites where building materials 
                    are often reused. Thus, dating old wood provides an estimate 
                    of when the tree was felled, not when the wood was last used. 
                    To avoid this problem, only seasonally produced materials 
                    were dated&#151;short-lived plants and plant parts&#151;including 
                    corn, beans, grass, and agave stalks.</p>
                  <p class="text">Eight radiocarbon assays were obtained as shown 
                    in the chart. As is often the case when there are multiple 
                    radiocarbon dates, some are in agreement with one another 
                    and other dating methods and some are not. In this instance 
                    there are two dates from Room 20 which are significantly different 
                    from one another and from the other dates. The older of these 
                    two dates would suggest occupation between the eighth and 
                    tenth centuries and is much too early as it falls long before 
                    the generally accepted beginning of the El Paso phase at about 
                    A.D. 1200. The second date for this room spans the twelfth 
                    and thirteenth centuries, is within the generally accepted 
                    date of the El Paso phase, but is still significantly younger 
                    than the other radiocarbon dates. This structure is one of 
                    the pithouses in the larger group of east-west oriented pithouses. 
                    The reason the dates from this structure fall considerably 
                    younger than the other radiocarbon dates is uncertain, but 
                    may well be because of contamination. This is the only structure 
                    on which recent trash had been deposited and mixed with the 
                    room fill. Among the debris were the remains of a calf, fireworks 
                    debris, and oil deposits. </p>
                  <p class="text">There are two radiocarbon dates from Room 13, 
                    a pithouse in the group of four pithouses in the southern 
                    part of the site. The 95% probability range on the average 
                    of these two dates is A.D. 1401-1450, suggesting that the 
                    pithouse occupation occurred during the first half of the 
                    fifteenth century. </p>
                  <p class="text">Turning to the pueblo, there are four radiocarbon 
                    assays. Rooms 2 and 4 are part of the initial or core group 
                    of four rooms of the pueblo. Feature 140 is a pit cut into 
                    the pithouse (Room 25) that is beneath rooms of the western 
                    part of the pueblo, and Feature 55 is a pit associated with 
                    the pueblo occupation and beneath the last rooms at the west 
                    end of the pueblo. The radiocarbon dates from these rooms 
                    and features are not significantly different from one another 
                    and have a 95% probability range of A.D. 1429-1491, perhaps 
                    suggesting a slightly later occupation than that of the pithouses.</p>
                  <p class="text">Except for the dates from Room 20, radiocarbon 
                    dates from Firecracker Pueblo are not, in statistical terms, 
                    significantly different from one another. The six remaining 
                    dates have a combined 95% probability range of A.D. 1423-1473. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The radiocarbon dates from Firecracker are important 
                    because they provide the first hard evidence that the El Paso 
                    phase flourished in the fifteenth century. In fact, these 
                    dates narrow the gap between the collapse of the pueblo system 
                    in the Jornada region and the first Spanish entrada in the 
                    late sixteenth century. When the Spanish entered the El Paso 
                    area, they found hunters and gatherers who apparently did 
                    not make pottery and grow corn. These Manso Indians may or 
                    may not be related to the earlier peoples in the area.</p>
                  <h3>Food Remains</h3>
                  <p class="text">The food remains found at the site are informative 
                    for several reasons. First they show that the inhabitants 
                    of Firecracker were ranging rather widely and making use of 
                    many plants and a fair number of animals. The bones from the 
                    site are mostly those of rabbits, jackrabbit and cottontail, 
                    with a few small birds, rodents, snakes, and lizards. In addition 
                    to local small game, an occasional deer or antelope was killed 
                    elsewhere, field dressed and butchered&#151;only meat bones 
                    and a few bones useful for tools were brought back to the 
                    site. Animal bones were much less common than plant remains. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Among the identified plant remains that are 
                    probably food items or residue are corn cobs and kernels, 
                    common and tepary beans, the rinds of cucurbits (squash) and 
                    gourds, amaranth seeds, purslane seeds, mesquite seeds and 
                    pods, tornillo pods, yucca leaves, agave leaves, sotol leaves, 
                    datil seeds, prickly pear seeds, and pinyon nuts. A large 
                    number of flotation samples was analyzed from floors, hearths, 
                    room fill. Samples of the fill from many of outside features 
                    were analyzed. This study is the only analysis of this sort 
                    for a pueblo site and the largest and best-defined analysis 
                    for any El Paso phase site. The native plant species identified 
                    at Firecracker parallel wild food species reported for the 
                    Mescalero Apache of this region. </p>
                  <p class="text">This <a href="images/plants.html" target="_blank" class="text">chart</a> 
                    shows the relative frequency of different kinds of plants 
                    in the 128 flotation samples that were analyzed from Firecracker. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">One of the most significant findings is 
                    the widespread occurrence of both corn cobs and corn kernels 
                    in samples from many pueblo and pithouse contexts. This shows 
                    a heavy reliance upon corn and probably other cultigens. Sites 
                    from earlier periods in the region have yielded negligible 
                    amounts of corn and very low percentages of flotation samples 
                    with corn. Some have suggested that the reliance of El Paso 
                    phase peoples on corn may have contributed to the demise of 
                    their culture.</p><br>
