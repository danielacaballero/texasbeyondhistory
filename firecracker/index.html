            <p class="text">In the early fifteenth century, farmers in the Hueco 
              Bolson near modern day El Paso, Texas, established a small village 
              or hamlet probably near their corn and bean fields. They were part 
              of the Jornada Mogollon culture and lived during the latter part 
              of what is called the El Paso phase or Pueblo period. But instead 
              of building a pueblo, they first constructed the type of house used 
              by their ancestors: pithouses. The small pithouse village was probably 
              lived in only during certain seasons of the year when the farmers 
              needed to tend nearby crops.</p>
                  <p class="text">The investigations at Firecracker Pueblo produced 
                    the first definitive evidence that pithouse structures resulted 
                    from short-term or seasonal occupation by puebloan peoples. 
                    Earlier researchers thought that all pithouses dated to earlier 
                    periods. Pithouse rooms, such as the one from Firecracker 
                    that is shown on the right, have now been found at other sites 
                    in the region. Although smaller than most pueblo habitation 
                    rooms, Room 13 has many of the same characteristics: a plastered 
                    hearth, caliche-plastered floor, and post holes. After it 
                    was used for habitation, it was apparently turned into a storage 
                    room. It was then that the perishable roof and upper walls 
                    caught fire and the contents of the room burned. A layer of 
                    burned materials including charred shelled and cob corn, beans, 
                    and gourds was found directly on the floor.</p>
            <p class="text">Soon the pithouses were replaced by a more substantial 
              adobe pueblo that grew to 16 rooms or so, some of them habitation 
              rooms and others used for storage. The rooms in the pueblo were 
              larger than the pithouse rooms, but had many of the same features 
              including a small plastered hearth near each doorway. Outside the 
              pueblo archeologists found many pits and activity areas such as 
              small cooking hearths, trash dumps, large roasting pits, and borrow 
              pits dug to obtain adobe and caliche building materials.</p>
                  <p class="text">But the most enigmatic finds were dozens of 
                    cylindrical pits, some small and some large. These are now 
                    believed to be storage pits where surplus food&#151;probably 
                    corn and beans&#151;was stored during periods when people 
                    were not living at Firecracker. If this interpretation is 
                    correct, fifteenth century farmers were much more mobile than 
                    was previously thought. Perhaps this reflects the difficulty 
                    that farmers had during this period. </p>
            <p class="text">Firecracker pueblo was abandoned in the second half 
              of the fifteenth century and is, in fact, one of the latest Jornada 
              Mogollon pueblos known. All across the Southwest and northern Mexico, 
              the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were times of great change. 
              Centuries-old traditions apparently came to a fairly rapid end within 
              a few generations as large and small pueblos were abandoned. These 
              changes were probably caused by a variety of factors including overpopulation, 
              overspecialization in agriculture, and climatic shifts to drier 
              and less predictable conditions.</p>
            <p class="text">In this exhibit you can learn more about the Jornada 
              Mogollon and Firecracker Pueblo. The site was excavated over a 10-year 
              period by numerous volunteers including members of the El Paso Archeological 
              Society and the Texas Archeological Society, as well as students 
              at UT El Paso. Many people who noticed the excavations as they drove 
              by Highway 54 north out of El Paso joined the effort as well. The 
              many years of hard work at Firecracker Pueblo produced long lessons 
              and big surprises.</p>
