    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->Room 25, with Bob Smith 
      for scale, is another deep pithouse with stepped entry, a hearth and four 
      roof supports. It took over two years to excavate this structure and unravel 
      the sequence of events. The upper part of the room had been filled with 
      trash from the pueblo occupants, and the pueblo was eventually extended 
      over this room. The trash deposit was easy to recognize, but ended with 
      a layer of caliche. Across most of the site, caliche occurs as a sterile, 
      natural layer below most features or served as the bottom for pits and some 
      room floors. At first we thought that the caliche layer in Room 25 was natural 
      and quit digging in the area. However, the large and rectangular shape to 
      the trash deposit was puzzling because it did not resemble other situations 
      of trash disposal at the site. So, another one-meter square was dig and 
      luckily encountered one of the neatly plastered pithouse room corners. It 
      turns out that this deep pithouse had been intentionally filled with caliche.
