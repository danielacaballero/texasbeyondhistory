                  <p class="text">Firecracker Pueblo appeared to be a small and 
                    unremarkable pueblo when it was first recorded in 1975. Next 
                    to Highway 54 in northeast El Paso, Texas, 8 km south of the 
                    Texas-New Mexico border, the leveling of sand dunes had revealed 
                    the adobe walls of what was thought to be a pueblo of some 
                    6 to 10 rooms. Between 1975 and 1979, additional grading of 
                    the site area exposed more walls, dark soils, and a variety 
                    of ceramic and stone artifacts. Temporary fireworks stands 
                    placed on the site during this period gave the site its name. 
                    Vandals began digging in several rooms, and the area became 
                    part of an industrial park. Fearing greater damage or loss 
                    of the site, formal excavations to document the site were 
                    started in the summer of 1980. At the time, we had no idea&#151;or 
                    desire&#151;that the Firecracker investigations would last 
                    for ten years.</p>
                  <p class="text">Volunteers led by archeologist Thomas C. O'Laughlin 
                    provided the direction and work force for the project, and 
                    literally hundreds participated in the excavation on weekends, 
                    holidays, and, on occasion, for one or two weeks in the summer. 
                    The youngest volunteer was 4; the oldest over 80. Many were 
                    members of the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS), but 
                    the location of the site next to a major highway lured numerous 
                    passersby into lending assistance (see <a href="pubarch.html" class="text">Public 
                    Archeology</a>). Television and newspaper coverage also stimulated 
                    interest. Professors in a variety of disciplines from the 
                    University of Texas at El Paso spent time at the site, as 
                    did their students (sometimes for credit). In 1986, the Texas 
                    Archeological Society held its field school at the site and 
                    over 200 people participated in the eight-day event (see &quot;<a href="tas.html" class="text">Just 
                    Barely in Texas</a>&quot;).</p>
                  <p class="text">The field investigations of Firecracker Pueblo 
                    lasted 10 years in part because of the intermittent schedule 
                    of an all-volunteer operation, but mainly because the site 
                    proved larger and more complex than we first expected. As 
                    we learned more about it, we saw opportunities to address 
                    new questions and altered the strategy accordingly. Prior 
                    to the investigation of this site, there had been no systematic 
                    excavation of areas lying outside of pueblo rooms. In the 
                    Jornada region, pueblo sites had been treated as if the pueblos 
                    themselves were all that was important to study. At Firecracker, 
                    we wanted to know what lay beyond the adobe walls&#151;what 
                    did the whole site look like? Therefore, we conducted systematic 
                    and extensive excavations of extramural (outside-the-walls) 
                    areas and found numerous and varied features, superimposed 
                    structures, and considerable trash. Some findings were expected; 
                    others were intriguing. Perhaps the most important discovery 
                    was that of 17 pithouses from one or several shortterm occupations 
                    immediately prior to the construction of the pueblo.</p>

                  <h3>Sliding into Archeology</h3>
                  <p class="text"> Tom O'Laughlin, the archeologist who led the 
                    Firecracker investigations and the primary author of this 
                    exhibit, became interested in archeology in a most unusual 
                    way. As a child, he lived at White Sands Missile Range where 
                    his father served in the Army. He remembers being intrigued 
                    with scattered pieces of pottery and other strange objects 
                    he found in his backyard. These, he was told, were very old 
                    Indian artifacts. Then one day while playing baseball on a 
                    sandy lot behind the school, a teammate slid into third base 
                    a bit too enthusiastically. When the dust settled, bones were 
                    visible in the freshly ploughed sand&#151;human bones. O'Laughlin 
                    returned to the sandy lot the next day and watched with fascination 
                    as a tall lanky man carefully exposed what remained of the 
                    burial. </p>
                  <p class="text">As it turned out, the man was archeologist Larry 
                    Hammack, then on loan to the Army from the Laboratory of Anthropology 
                    at the Museum of New Mexico. He was there because the Commanding 
                    General of White Sands was keenly interested in archeology. 
                    With the Commander's encouragement, Hammack and off-duty military 
                    personnel excavated a small El Paso phase pueblo on the base. 
                    O'Laughlin visited the dig every chance he got, asking questions 
                    and learning about what was being found. Others took him on 
                    field trips and introduced him to rock art. He was hooked. 
                    O'Laughlin joined the El Paso Archaeological Society in 1960 
                    and has been a member ever since. </p>
                  <p class="text">After his family moved to Las Cruces, he started 
                    archeological projects on his own, recording sites in the 
                    area. While still in high school he began giving presentations 
                    and writing papers, efforts that earned him an award from 
                    the New Mexico Archaeological Society. The summer he graduated 
                    from high school he attended the University of New Mexico 
                    field school at Taos and became acquainted with professional 
                    archeologists who became his mentors and life-long friends. 
                    His path was set. </p>
                  <p class="text">In college he pursued biology and anthropology, 
                    earning several biology degrees from New Mexico State University 
                    and a Masters in Anthropology from the University of New Mexico. 
                    Throughout he worked on archeological projects every chance 
                    he got, first as a volunteer and then as a paid archeologist. 
                    Some of his early projects included Fremont sites in Utah 
                    through Jesse Jennings, the Anasazi Origins Project directed 
                    by Cynthia Irwin-Williams in central New Mexico, and excavations 
                    at Fort Fillmore directed by John Wilson of the Laboratory 
                    of Anthropology of the Museum of New Mexico. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today O'Laughlin is the Assistant Director of 
                    the Albuquerque Museum. He has been long associated with natural 
                    history and history museums. While running the Firecracker 
                    excavations, he served as chief curator at the El Paso Centennial 
                    Museum and Director of the Wilderness Park Museum. He has 
                    also done contract archeology, taught at UT El Paso, and co-directed 
                    the Jornada Anthropological Research Association. </p>
                  <p class="text">Throughout his career O'Laughlin has maintained 
                    a close relationship with avocational archeologists. He is 
                    a longtime member of not only the El Paso Archaeological Society 
                    but also TAS, the New Mexico Archaeological Society, and the 
                    Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society. Presently, 
                    he is a Trustee for the New Mexico Archaeological Society. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Firecracker Pueblo lies at the heart of O'Laughlin's 
                    geographical area of interest&#151;central to southern New 
                    Mexico and west Texas, with extensions into Mexico. Although 
                    a specialist in the pueblo period, he has worked on many other 
                    kinds of sites. For example, he worked with J. Charles Kelley 
                    at Alta Vista in Zacatecas, Mexico, a major ceremonial center 
                    of the Chalchihuites Culture about A.D. 500. Currently (2001), 
                    he is working with Mike Adler and Michael Bletzer of Southern 
                    Methodist University on the investigation of Piro pueblos 
                    near Socorro, New Mexico.</p>
