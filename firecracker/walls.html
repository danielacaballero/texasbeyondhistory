                  <p class="text">The systematic investigation of the extramural 
                    areas&#151;those that lay outside the walls of the pueblo&#151;was 
                    an essential part of the research effort at Firecracker Pueblo. 
                    This had not been attempted before at a pueblo site in the 
                    Jornada region. The approach was simple, and eventually just 
                    over 20% of the site area outside of structures was excavated. 
                    First, a checkerboard of one-meter squares was dug, each separated 
                    by three-meter gaps. Then, another one-meter square was excavated 
                    in the middle of the gap defined by every four excavated squares. 
                    The checkerboard excavations were expanded and sometimes connected 
                    to learn more about particular features and deposits. Finally, 
                    a series of backhoe trenches was run north-south across much 
                    of the site. These techniques enabled the definition of stratigraphy 
                    throughout the site, the recognition of patterned distributions 
                    of features and artifacts, and the recording of 243 outside 
                    features and one burial. </p> 
                  <p class="text">The outside features varied greatly in size, 
                    appearance, and function. Most were pits of one sort or another&#151;trash 
                    pits large and small; shallow pits containing small cooking 
                    hearths; small postholes sometimes found in patterns, sometimes 
                    isolated; curious cylindrical pits believed to be temporary 
                    food storage bins; large roasting pits containing adobe blocks 
                    that apparently functioned as substitute cooking stones; and 
                    even larger borrow pits where adobe-making and caliche-plaster 
                    materials were obtained. There were also trash deposits or 
                    middens, some of which accumulated on the ground surface, 
                    while other trash was dumped into pithouses and other depressions.</p>
                  <p class="text">Most outside features, trash middens, and the 
                    trash within pithouses can be attributed to the pueblo occupation. 
                    This was determined by a careful study of the distribution 
                    of certain items including matching sherds of the same vessels, 
                    fragments of ground-stone tools, and fragments of unusual 
                    types of stone. Over half of the pueblo room floors, nearly 
                    half of the outside features, and nearly all of the trash-filled 
                    pithouses had pieces of artifacts which could be matched within 
                    one another, strongly suggesting that they were used at the 
                    same time. In contrast, no matches were found between objects 
                    found on pithouse floors and those within exterior features.</p>
                  <p class="text">The outside features were not randomly distributed 
                    but were instead formed more or less concentric zones or arcs 
                    extending outward from the pueblo. The basic pattern is a 
                    clean area immediately around the pueblo, ringed by small 
                    cooking hearths and trash dumps and patterns of postholes 
                    suggesting temporary structures like shade remadas. Outside 
                    these were large roasting pits and borrow pits. These patterns 
                    are harder to discern at the western end of the pueblo where 
                    the addition of rooms apparently pushed back the area used 
                    for these features during the life of the pueblo.</p>
                  <p class="text">In more detail, the inner zone is the space 
                    next to the south side of the pueblo that is fairly clear 
                    of features and trash. At a distance of 4-8 meters (about 
                    13-26 feet) out from the pueblo and arcing towards the east 
                    and west ends of the pueblo, some trash and small hearths 
                    were found. These hearths appear as lenses of ash and charcoal 
                    or basin-shaped pits with ash and charcoal. Between 6 and 
                    15 meters (about 20-50 feet) from the pueblo, there is an 
                    arc where most of the features and trash deposits are concentrated. 
                    The features are varied and include small pits and postholes, 
                    small and medium-sized, irregularly shaped pits, and cylindrical 
                    pits. Trash and features are most dense immediately to the 
                    south of the core rooms of the pueblo. Finally, there is a 
                    perimeter defined by large borrow pits, roasting pits or ovens, 
                    and diminishing trash. The roasting pits or ovens are interesting 
                    for they are filled with ash, charcoal, and large fragments 
                    of burned adobe. There are no surface rocks in the site vicinity, 
                    and adobe was obviously being substituted for rock in these 
                    ovens. </p>
                  <p class="text">The addition of rooms to the pueblo had the 
                    effect of moving these arcs of features and trash outward 
                    and blurring the described pattern. This is particularly apparent 
                    for the western part of the site, while the highway has truncated 
                    the eastern area of features. There are few features and little 
                    trash on the northern side of the pueblo. The evident spatial 
                    arrangement of features and trash pits would suggest an intensive 
                    and perhaps lengthy occupation that demanded maintenance of 
                    space and separation of activities with conflicting requirements. 
                    Two pieces of information, however, could suggest an alternative 
                    scenario.</p>
                  <p class="text">First, nearly all of the ground stone associated 
                    with the pueblo occupation was found buried in outside pits. 
                    These are not worn and broken pieces of groundstone, but massive 
                    and little used metates and manos. These are assumed to represent 
                    items that were cached (hidden) as might be expected if Firecracker 
                    Pueblo was occupied intermittently or seasonally. Second, 
                    there are 47 pits with circular outlines, vertical sides, 
                    and flat bottoms cut into the natural caliche layer that underlies 
                    the site. These pits are not plastered, but some contained 
                    shaped fragments of adobe that may be the remnants of some 
                    sort of cover or seal. They range from .5 to 2 meters (1.5 
                    to 6.5 feet) in diameter and .4 to .6 meters (16-24 inches) 
                    in depth (the original depths were probably greater -- the 
                    site area had been deflated by wind erosion and partially 
                    graded by machinery). Most are layered with trash and sand 
                    deposits, and some are filled only with clean blow sand. </p>
                  <p class="text">These enigmatic cylindrical features have been 
                    called storage pits when found in Pithouse or Archaic period 
                    sites of the region and the Southwest. But exterior storage 
                    pits are not typical of situations where people depend on 
                    corn and live in pueblos year-round. Exterior storage pits 
                    are often associated with populations that are seasonally 
                    mobile. In this case, storage pits may have been used to conceal 
                    stored foodstuffs when the area was not occupied. If so, this 
                    is another indication that the site was not a permanent village, 
                    but was instead occupied intermittently, perhaps seasonally. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1980 when the work was begun at Firecracker 
                    Pueblo, an average of one burial had been recorded for every 
                    11 or 12 rooms excavated at El Paso phase pueblos elsewhere. 
                    These burials were also almost all adults. With the extensive 
                    and systematic testing of outside areas and the excavation 
                    of structures, only a single burial of an 18- to 22-year-old 
                    woman was found in an outside area at Firecracker Pueblo. 
                    There was no evidence for a cemetery, cremations, secondary 
                    burials, or children. Given the extensive excavations at Firecracker 
                    and what is known about other El Paso phase pueblo sites, 
                    the scarcity of burials is yet another clue that the people 
                    who lived at Firecracker were not living there year-round.</p>
