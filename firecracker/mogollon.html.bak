                  <p class="text">The western tip of Texas and adjacent areas 
                    of southern New Mexico and northern Mexico have a distinctive 
                    archeological tradition known as the Jornada Mogollon. The 
                    &quot;jornada&quot; comes from the Jornado del Muerto&#151;journey 
                    of death&#151;a reference to a desolate stretch of the Camino 
                    Real (King's highway) used by the Spanish on their way north 
                    from El Paso to Sante Fe. Just north of Las Cruces, the terrain 
                    forced travelers to swing far to the east of the Rio Grande 
                    through a waterless basin between mountain ranges. &quot;Mogollon&quot; 
                    refers to the archeological remains left by the later prehistoric 
                    peoples in much of southern New Mexico, east-central Arizona, 
                    northern Chihuahua, and far western Texas. </p> 
                  <p class="text">The Mogollon tradition is one of the &quot;big 
                    three&quot; cultures in the Southwest (the others are the 
                    Anasazi and Hohokam) and is the largest in geographical extent 
                    spanning some 400 miles east-west and as much as 500 miles 
                    north-south. Various Mogollon &quot;branches&quot; have been 
                    defined to describe the cultural variation across such an 
                    immense area including the Jornada Mogollon, the branch farthest 
                    to the east. Across the Mogollon region, many similar cultural 
                    patterns can be traced, although the timing and expression 
                    of these patterns varies from branch to branch.</p>
                  <p class="text">Perhaps the most fundamental shared pattern&#151;one 
                    that is paralleled in the Hohokam and Anasazi areas&#151;is 
                    the shift through time from hunting and gathering to agriculture 
                    and from highly mobile to increasingly sedentary lifeways. 
                    Early Mogollon peoples, between roughly A.D. 400-800, lived 
                    in small pithouse villages and hamlets. After A.D. 800 or 
                    so, pithouse villages were built on an increasingly larger 
                    and more elaborate scale as agriculture became more important. 
                    By A.D. 1150, Mogollon peoples began building masonry and 
                    adobe pueblos, similar to those of the Anasazi, with increasingly 
                    concentrated populations relying heavily on agriculture. But 
                    by A.D. 1400-1500, much of the Mogollon area was depopulated 
                    and Mogollon culture ceased to exist as a distinctive archeological 
                    expression. Most archeologists now believe that the Mogollon 
                    and Anasazi cultures were both ancestral to the Pueblo peoples 
                    first seen by Coronado in 1540.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Jornada Mogollon area saw many of the same 
                    cultural developments that were taking place elsewhere in 
                    the Mogollon area as well as the Anasazi area to the north. 
                    By about A.D. 400 (or earlier) pithouse villages were established 
                    by peoples making distinctive El Paso Brownware ceramics. 
                    They were experimenting with cultigens&#151;corn, beans, and 
                    squash&#151;but still lived on mainly wild plants and animals. 
                    Through time the villages became larger and more complex as 
                    reliance on agriculture increased and more permanent settlement 
                    was possible. Extensive trade networks were developed between 
                    different areas of the Southwest including the more sophisticated 
                    regional center of Paquim&eacute; (Casas Grandes) in northwestern 
                    Chihuahua. </p>
                  <p class="text">Around A.D. 1200, the first pueblos&#151; rectangular, 
                    multi-room living compounds made of coursed adobe brick&#151;appear 
                    in the Jornada area. Over the next 250 years, numerous pueblos 
                    were established, some lasting for several generations, others 
                    soon abandoned. Agriculture was now the mainstay of the economy 
                    and an ingenious variety of farming techniques was employed 
                    including dry land, runoff diversion, and in some cases, irrigation. 
                    In the Hueco Bolson where Firecracker Pueblo is located, there 
                    were few opportunities for anything but runoff diversion, 
                    a method best suited for farming the alluvial fans at the 
                    base of the mountains. But, because the area was very dry 
                    and subject to drought, the small farming communities lived 
                    a precarious existence. Several bad years in a row were probably 
                    enough to force the people to move to a better location.</p>
					
                  <div align="center"></div>
                        <p class="text">The Pueblo period, or El Paso phase (A.D. 1200-1450), 
                    in the Jornada Mogollon saw a great deal of interaction with 
                    other regions, especially the Casas Grandes culture to the 
                    south in Mexico, but also southwest New Mexico and southeastern 
                    Arizona, as well as the Anasazi area to the north. This is 
                    most easily seen and documented in the pottery types and shell 
                    ornaments. Trace-element studies have shown that certain types 
                    of pottery were moved long distances. Types such as Mimbres 
                    Black-on-white, Chupadero Black-on-white, Playas Red Incised, 
                    and El Paso Polychrome were all widely distributed across 
                    distances of 200 miles and more from their production centers. 
                    As the name suggests, El Paso Polychrome was produced locally 
                    in the Hueco Bolson, at Firecracker Pueblo and many other 
                    sites.</p>

                        <div class="caption">Partial El Paso Polychrome vessels

                  <p class="text">By the late fifteenth century, virtually all 
                    of the Jornada Mogollon pueblos had been abandoned, including 
                    Firecracker, and the regional population dropped precipitously. 
                    Archeologists debate the reasons why, but most likely it was 
                    a combination of factors including overpopulation, an overly 
                    specialized agricultural economy, and an unfavorable climatic 
                    shift to drier conditions and less predictable rainfall. We 
                    are not entirely sure what happened to the people. Some may 
                    have stayed in the area in small bands and family groups and 
                    shifted back to hunting and gathering. The Manso and Suma 
                    peoples encountered in the El Paso vicinity by the early Spanish 
                    could be descendants of Jornada Mogollon groups, but were 
                    said to be hunters and gatherers who did not grow corn or 
                    make pottery. Other Jornada Mogollon people probably moved 
                    north into the Salinas area of central New Mexico and became 
                    part of the pueblos at Gran Quivira and other localities visited 
                    by the Spanish. </p>
                  <p class="text">However it happened, most of the Jornada 
                    Mogollon area was abandoned before the Spanish arrived. It 
                    is not coincidence that the same thing occurred in other nearby 
                    regions such as the Casas Grandes area in northern Mexico 
                    and the Mimbres area in south-central New Mexico. This was 
                    a time of tumultuous change all across the American Southwest 
                    and Northern Mexico, one that archeologists are still trying 
                    to understand.</p><br>
