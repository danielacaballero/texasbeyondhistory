                  <p class="text">The 1986 TAS field school was billed as the 
                    "just-barely-in-Texas TAS field school," as it was within 
                    El Paso and only a few miles from borders with New Mexico 
                    and Mexico. In addition, the archeology was different from 
                    that experienced at most TAS field schools because it dealt 
                    with cultural remains tied to Southwestern traditions. Adobe-walled 
                    rooms, painted pottery, and turquoise jewelry were the draw 
                    of this field school, and participants in the field or in 
                    the lab were enjoined to learn about pueblo culture. </p>
                  <p class="text">Fieldwork centered on the site of Firecracker 
                    Pueblo. The investigation of this site had begun in 1980, 
                    and by the time of the TAS field school, much was known. A 
                    pueblo had been identified that consisted of no more than 
                    20 rooms including habitation rooms, storage rooms, and a 
                    large communal or ceremonial room. A number of somewhat small 
                    and isolated rooms had also been found, but their relationship 
                    to the pueblo was not clear. Outside activity areas had been 
                    investigated to a limited extent, and this revealed a variety 
                    of features and considerable trash. In general, this site 
                    appeared to be typical of the many hundreds of other small 
                    pueblos in the region. </p>
                  <p class="text">The TAS field school added considerably to the 
                    knowledge of the site and helped focus investigation in following 
                    years. During the field school, additional rooms of the pueblo 
                    were excavated, many isolated rooms and pithouses were identified 
                    and several excavated, and outside areas and features were 
                    delimited and examined. As a result of the field school, an 
                    occupation that predated the pueblo was recognized, architectural 
                    forms (pithouses) not previously noted for the pueblo period 
                    were documented, patterns of outside features and activities 
                    were being defined for the first time for a site of this period, 
                    and cultural materials and special samples were retrieved 
                    that helped make this site the most intensively and best documented 
                    pueblo site for the region.</p>
                  <p class="text"> In addition to the excavations at Firecracker 
                    Pueblo, participants assisted the Texas Parks and Wildlife 
                    Department (TPWD) with a survey of lands in the Franklin Mountains 
                    west of the pueblo and helped with the investigation of a 
                    mission in the Rio Grande Valley. The survey directed by Ron 
                    Ralph of TPWD focused on recording mining camps, caves and 
                    rock art sites that were known but poorly documented. Dr. 
                    Rex Gerald of the University of Texas at El Paso ran test 
                    excavations at the late seventeenth- to eighteenth-century 
                    site of Mission Socorro. This mission was for Piro Indians 
                    brought to El Paso from New Mexico at the time of the Pueblo 
                    Revolt. </p>
                  <p class="text">Other activities associated with the field school 
                    included tours of the rock art at Hueco Tanks State Park, 
                    a tour of the Old Mission Trail, visits to museums, and afternoon 
                    and evening lectures and discussions, as well as tasting the 
                    border life through shopping and dining in El Paso and Juarez. 
                    Craft activities, a visit to the Tonka toy factory, and basketball 
                    games made life more enjoyable for the young ones, and some 
                    adults. As with other field schools, guitars and voices straining 
                    for unison could occasionally be heard. E. Mott Davis, of 
                    course, closed the field school in his traditional way. </p>
                  <p class="text">The food was better than that at some field 
                    schools, courtesy of struggling new chefs made available through 
                    the Job Corps. The campground was convenient and worked very 
                    well&#151;it would have been perfect if it weren't for the 
                    constant hum of generators at the nearby electric plant. Carol 
                    Hedrick spearheaded arrangements for the field school. Camp 
                    boss was Gene Collins. Lab director was Jack Hedrick. Field 
                    supervisors were E. Mott Davis and Ann Fox. Just about everyone 
                    who attended had a role. It was a bit amazing to see nearly 
                    200 people assemble, live together, and disappear within 10 
                    days.leaving only footprints and a whole lot of memories.
