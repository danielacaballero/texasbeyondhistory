                  <p class="text">Excavations at Firecracker Pueblo began in July 
                    of 1980, and fieldwork was completed in December of 1990. 
                    The length of the project and the proximity of the site to 
                    a major highway provided many opportunities to promote archeology 
                    and engage the public with the rich history of the region. 
                    There were the usual newspaper and magazine articles and a 
                    variety of television and radio programs featuring new finds 
                    or activities. There were also numerous informal and formal 
                    presentations of the &quot;in-progress&quot; investigation 
                    to archeological and historical societies and other civic 
                    or social organizations in Texas and New Mexico and the annual 
                    meetings of TAS and the Archaeological Society of New Mexico. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The location of the site within a few feet of 
                    Highway 54 did create an interesting situation. Throughout 
                    the project, everyone from truck drivers to people on the 
                    way to Ruidoso to ski to whole families would stop and ask 
                    what we were doing. These were not just a few people but a 
                    constant flow of people that probably numbered in the thousands 
                    over the years. It gave us an opportunity to show off the 
                    site and talk about the past and the role of archeologists. 
                    It also brought many volunteers to the project. Some people 
                    quit what they were doing that day and pitched in on the spot 
                    with the work at hand. Others became regular volunteers for 
                    the excavation and later for the lab work. Some joined the 
                    El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) and a few even went 
                    back to college for credit or non-credit courses in anthropology 
                    and history. In many cases entire families became involved, 
                    including several instances of three generations of the same 
                    family working together at the site.</p>
                  <p class="text">Through the Department of Sociology and Anthropology 
                    at the University of Texas at El Paso, students were afforded 
                    the opportunity to earn credit for working at the site or 
                    through using materials from the site in analytical or laboratory 
                    courses. Also through the university and Insights, the local 
                    science museum, support was provided for a series, Art and 
                    Archaeology. This was a program for children 10 to 14 years 
                    in age that combined elements of art, archeology and Southwestern 
                    cultures and incorporated fieldwork at the site and classroom 
                    projects with artifacts from the site. As a separate project, 
                    Sunrise Publications produced in 1994 a children's book and 
                    companion video simply entitled <i>Firecracker Pueblo</i>. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">There have been exhibits of photographs and 
                    artifacts from Firecracker Pueblo in museums and libraries 
                    of El Paso, and a large mural of what the site may have looked 
                    like during its occupation is installed at the Institute of 
                    Texan Cultures in San Antonio. Finally, the 1986 TAS field 
                    school at Firecracker Pueblo was featured in a Texas Parks 
                    and Wildlife video called <i>The Rock Art of Texas</i>. All 
                    in all, Firecracker Pueblo found its way into a lot of things 
                    public.</p>
