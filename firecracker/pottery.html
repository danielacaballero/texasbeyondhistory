                  <p class="text">Pottery is the most common and often the most 
                    informative artifact category at Jornada Mogollon sites. Whole 
                    pots or even reconstructable ones are rare. Mostly what we 
                    find are thousands of sherds: pottery is fragile, and all 
                    it takes is one slip and a nice pot becomes a pile of sherds. 
                    But this works out nicely for archeologists&#151;the sherds 
                    can tell us what kind of pottery it is, where it is from, 
                    what kind of vessel it is, as well as something about disposal 
                    patterns. Most sherds wound up in trash heaps, but others 
                    were left where the pots were dropped. </p>
                  <p class="text">El Paso Polychrome makes up over 90% of the 
                    ceramic material from Firecracker Pueblo and is typical of 
                    the late El Paso phase. Jars outnumbered bowls by approximately 
                    four to one. Less common vessel forms are pitchers, ladles, 
                    and &quot;terraced-rim&quot; bowls. Whereas in earlier Jornada 
                    Mogollon sites the undecorated El Paso Brownware pottery is 
                    often the most common type, the only undecorated piece of 
                    local manufacture at Firecracker is a small pinch bowl (a 
                    bowl formed simply by inserting a thumb into a wad of clay 
                    and pinching the clay against the palm&#151;something a child 
                    might do). </p>
                  <p class="text">In addition to the locally produced wares, there 
                    are many sherds of tradewares including Chupadero Black-on-white, 
                    Gila Polychrome, and polychromes and other wares of the Casas 
                    Grandes culture. These types would not be unexpected for a 
                    site dating to the fifteenth century. However, there are sherds 
                    from other pottery types thought to have been made centuries 
                    earlier such as Mimbres Black-on-white. These sherds could 
                    have been picked up at abandoned sites nearby or perhaps represent 
                    heirloom pieces.</p>
                  <p class="text">Pottery is also helpful in examining distribution 
                    patterns within sites. One major question at Firecracker is 
                    the time difference between the pithouse and pueblo occupations. 
                    To help answer this question we looked to see if there were 
                    any differences in the pottery types and forms present in 
                    each area. An analysis of 1,037 rim sherds (which are more 
                    informative and varied than body sherds) of El Paso Polychrome 
                    found no significant differences between the rim attributes 
                    of the pithouse and pueblo occupations, suggesting that these 
                    are very nearly contemporaneous.</p>
                  <h3>Pottery Making</h3>
                  <p class="text">With so much pottery it is only to be expected 
                    that pottery making was a common activity at Jornada Mogollon 
                    sites. And ample evidence of this was found at Firecracker. 
                    The best evidence is the finding of pottery-making tools, 
                    small deposits of unfired potter's clay, and an unfired and 
                    unfinished pottery bowl. Unfired potter's clay from one of 
                    the pithouses was matched to a clay bed not far from the pueblo, 
                    suggesting that El Paso Polychrome was being made at Firecracker. 
                    Pottery-making tools were found lying on several floors of 
                    both pueblo and pithouse rooms; perhaps the potters intended 
                    to come back or maybe pottery tools were easy enough to find 
                    or make.</p>
                  <p class="text">Many kinds of pottery-making tools were recognized 
                    at Firecracker. Half-rounded and smoothed potsherds were probably 
                    used as shaping and smoothing tools. Round disks of pottery 
                    probably served as platforms or &quot;dishes&quot; upon which 
                    pots were built; the round bottom of the sherd helped shape 
                    the bottom of the new pot and it allowed the potter to rotate 
                    the pot as she worked on it. (She? Numerous ethnohistoric 
                    and ethnographic accounts in the Southwest show that pottery 
                    was ordinarily made by women.) Small smooth pebbles were probably 
                    used as polishing stones after the &quot;green&quot; pot was 
                    mostly dried, but before it was fired. A large sherd with 
                    a rounded notch was probably used as a rim &quot;template&quot; 
                    to help the potter shape and smooth the rim of flared-mouthed 
                    jars.</p>
                  <p class="text">The most interesting find of pottery-making 
                    tools was in one of the pithouses, Room 26. In one area of 
                    the floor of this room was a concentration that must have 
                    been left by a potter. An unfinished and unfired clay bowl 
                    shows work in progress. Several sherds form a paint palette 
                    where the paint was mixed and held to decorate El Paso Polychrome. 
                    We know this because some of the bright yellow limonite (iron 
                    oxide) was still there. There were also polishing pebbles 
                    in this cluster of things.</p>
                  <p class="text">Adding up this evidence, it appears that 
                    pottery making was a common activity at Firecracker Pueblo 
                    as it probably was at most Jornada Mogollon residential sites. 
                    Pottery was needed for storing drinking water, storing food, 
                    cooking, and food serving, among other uses. </p> <br>
