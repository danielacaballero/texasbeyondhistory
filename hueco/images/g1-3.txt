<p><b>Types and Condition of Pictures:</b> [Ed. Note: It is not clear whether Kirkland wrote the following about the images shown in Plate 116 or whether it was intended as a more general description of conditions of art of the site.] </p><br>
<p>There appears to be two distinct types of pictures: the one including the blanket-like designs and kachina masks, carefully done in paints almost as thin as dyes; the other very crudely done with thick coarse paints, sometimes resembling colored mud. Very likely other types are present and will come to light with more study. The pictures as a whole are in very good state of preservation. A few pictures have been damaged by smoke and a few others in exposed places have been damaged by rain or blowing sand. But in many well protected shelters the pictures are remarkably clear. Less than one percent of the designs were too dim to be easily copied. Although thousands of names and dates had been placed on the rocks about the tanks, hardly a single Indian design had been seriously damaged by vandals. Practically all damage observed resulted from age or exposure. Very little flaking of the rock was noticed. The condition of the pictures does not point to extreme age. </p><br>
<p>Site 4. These designs are high up the second level under a low ceiling that could only be reached by crawling of all-fours along a dangerous position. The red was clear and the blue quite bright. At this point a scale of 1.5" to 1' or larger was adapted for all mask drawings. </p><br>
<p>5-A and B. These designs are at the end of a long shelter very near the ground. They are very dim. </p><br>
<p>6-B. These pictures are painted on the walls of the dark hole in 6-D. Due to the uneven surfaces of the hole the relative positions of the pictures are not exactly accurate. </p><br> 
<p>6-D and 6-C. The designs in white are very clear having been protected from the weather. Those in blue and black are very dim. Note the obscene phallic design found only in the white paint at Hueco Tanks. </p>
