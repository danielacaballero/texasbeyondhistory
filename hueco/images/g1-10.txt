<p>13-A, B, C. These are on the back wall of a small open shelter on the second level, badly exposed to blowing sand. The designs are dim. </p><br>
<p>13-D, E, F. These are in a small shelter on the ground level which has been badly smoked. </p><br>
<p>13-D is very dim and had to be reconstructed to some extent. The bottom part had been smeared badly and the top part smoked black. </p><br>
<p>13-E, the left figure is very dim but the right figure is perfectly clear. </p><br>
<p>13-F, all of these designs are in bad condition. </p><br>
<p>13-E fits between the other section with only a foot or so omitted on each side. </p>
