<p>14-B and C. These are on the back wall of a high overhanging cliff just above the ground. This overhang was used as a shelter by the Indians. </p><br>

<p>14-B. This is unusual in color and very dim. </p><br>
 
<p>14-D. This is under a leaning boulder about 30 yards to the right of 14-B. </p><br>

<p>15-E. This is on the ceiling of a small shelter at the end of the levee at site 15. There were a few other designs in the shelter too dim to copy. </p><br>
<p>17-F. This interesting bird is in a high rock pocket just below 17-E. The head of the bird is almost destroyed. </p>
