<p>These designs are on the ceiling of a large cave containing one of the natural water tanks. The ranch house is only a few yards away. Part of the cave is used as a cow barn and the water tank furnishes drinking water for the ranch. Most of the pictures are still quite distinct. The small red squares above the black figure. in 18-A are masks drawn on a larger scale in 18-e, accession 2261-136. </p>
