<p>Site 27 is a large deep shelter at the extreme southern point of the south mountain. It is level with the ground and furnished the artists shelter on rainy nights. The ceiling is smoked black and the designs in white are very dim on the black surface. They can easily be reached while standing on the floor of the shelter. </p>
