<p>16-B and C. These designs are under two large boulders standing out in front of the cliff. </p><br>
<p>17-E. These are in a small rock pocket high up the cliff very difficult to reach. They were drawn by guess, some 8 feet away rather than risk a fall to the foot of the cliff about 40 feet below. </p><br>
<p>17-H, I, J, E. These faces are on the rock at various places below 17-E. </p><br>
<p>17-L,M, N are under boulders high up to the left 17-E. </p><br>
<p>17-0. This little design does not properly belong to site 17. It was found in a well-used shelter under a huge boulder in front of the hill about 300 yards west of site 17. No other designs were in the shelter. </p><br>

<p>15-A and B are under boulders a few yards north of 15-C. </p>
