<p>24-E is the principal design on the back wall of the main shelter at site 24. This shelter is two levels above and t o the right of site 23. It overlooks the whole valley to the west. A rectangular rock stands a few feet in front of the wall and about five feet high. The splashes of red were probably made by striking the wall with a large color soaked brush on the en d of a stick while standing on this rock. 24-F is the ceiling immediately above this wall and over the large rock. </p>
