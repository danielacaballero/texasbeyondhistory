<p>19-C These designs are under a large rock which forms a small shelter at the entrance to a small draw extending into the rock mass. They are very carefully drawn with thin paint. </p><br>

<p>20-D and E. These designs are on opposite walls of a tunnel-like shelter about 10 feet from the entrance. They are near the floor. 20-D is very dim. </p><br>

<p>20-F is on the same wall as 20-E but nearer the entrance. </p>
