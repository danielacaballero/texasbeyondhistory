<p>l-A. This group of pictures appears on a protected vertical rock wall overlooking the entrance to the main tank, and can easily be seen by everyone who visits the location. The top of the pictures are about 10 feet from the ground and must have required a ladder for their making. This group is perhaps the best example of a historical culture using white extensively, found at various sites at the tanks. Color: The white is quite thick and roughly applied. The yellow is also coarse. The black is so badly faded that it could hardly be detected in places. The red is the usual oxide of iron. Note the horses and other white influence. </p><br>
<p>l-D and 1-E. These designs appear on the back walls of two low shelters on the second level to the right of l-A. Two designs in yellow were careful painted with very thin color which looks like a stain on the rock. I thought, at first, that they had been stenciled. The face on l-E and the center design on 1-c were also carefully done with thin paint. </p>
