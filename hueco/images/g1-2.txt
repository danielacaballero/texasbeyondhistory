<p><b>Signs of Human Habitation: </b></p><br>
<p>In front of several water holes are extensive burnt rock middens and other evidence of open camping. Flint flakes and pot sherds are plentiful throughout the entire area but artifacts of all kinds are extremely scarce now. None of the shelters contain middens. Most of them have bare rock floors. Indian pictures are found on the back walls and ceiling of almost every shelter that has been inhabited. </p><br>
<p>Signatures of white visitors date back to 1849. Since that time thousands of names and dates have been carved, scratched or painted on the rocks about the tanks. The main water hole is pointed out with a sign reading, "Watter Hear". The lettering is similar to that in a name dated 1849 and gives the impression that the sign near the water hole is that old. The older dates, those before 1920, are found chiefly at the good water holes, or natural tanks; while many dates since 1920 are found at interesting picnicking grounds far away from natural water. Only on the north side of the north and east mountains are signatures and dates absent from the shelters. This is because the natural approach to the location is from the south where the best water supplies are found, and because of the difficult and round-about approach to the north side. </p><br>
<p>2-A. This mask drawing appeared to have been originally in blue and white, but the blue had faded to a blue-gray. It is located on a low ceiling about 3 feet high. </p><br>
<p>2-B is on an exposed wall above a high rock and is almost too dim to copy. </p><br> 
<p>2-C is high on a poorly protected wall which can only be reached from a high rock. </p>
