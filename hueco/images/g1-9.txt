<p>Site 10-B. This is on a shelf of rock difficult to reach just behind the red and green mask 10-C. </p><br>

<p>Site 10-A. These designs are under a small shelter high up a small canyon to the left of 10-B. There were small water holes in front of the shelter. </p><br>

<p>Site 11. These designs are low down on a wall in a large rock crevice. Near by is a very large shelter smoked so black that the design in it could not be accurately copied. </p><br>

<p>Site 12-B. The mask drawing is on the rock just below the pocket containing 12-A. </p><br>

<p>Site 12-C. These designs are low down to the right of l2-B; badly exposed and very dim. </p><br>

<p>Site 14-A. This is alone under a huge boulder about 50 yards to the left of 14-B. </p><br>
<p>Site 17-P. These designs are on the ceiling of a horizontal rock crack barely large enough to permit one to crawl into it. They are just to the left of 17-G. </p>
