<p>17-G. Is on the wall and ceiling of a large well used shelter at the base of the cliff at site 17. There is a tank of permanent water at this site which was used by early travelers. Hundreds of names appear on the smoked wall of this shelter. The pictures are damaged by rough use. The snake is accurately copied except the color has been strengthened and restored. </p><br> 

<p>17-D and C. These designs are under large rocks no more than 4 feet above the rock floor. They are quite dim but distinct in good light. </p><br>

<p>18-E. These small masks shown in detail were on 18-A just above the black figure. </p>
