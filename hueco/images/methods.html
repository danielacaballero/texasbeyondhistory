<h1>Methods and Observations </h1>
<p>Kirkland kept detailed records and maps of the art he was recording and also left the following notes about his methods: </p>
<h2>Notation of sites:</h2>
<p>Work began at the chief water hole between the North and South Mountains and proceeded from left to right along the base of the North Mountain. Pictures were found as a rule in groups of shelters around a water supply. A site number was given to each distinct group of shelters or to a single shelter where it stood alone. The letter following the site number indicates the position of the pictures at the site from left to right; (A) being the pictures at the extreme left. A more detailed description of the locations is given, where necessary, in the notes for individual sites and pictures. In order to save space on the plates it was necessary to place many of the copies slightly out of their correct order. But in general, the copies proceed from left to right as they were made, and can easily be located by the site number and the position letter if reference is made to the key map. Most of the shelters containing pictures are on the ground level. None were found above the second level. Most of the pictures were painted in position easily reached from the floor or tops of rocks without the aid of a ladder. However, some designs are ten feet above the ground and others appear in small shelters or pockets in the rocks, difficult to access. </p>
