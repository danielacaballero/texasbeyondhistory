<p>Site 22 is on the side of a large rock standing out in front of the main rock mass. The designs were very dim. </p><br>

<p>23-a and B are on the ceiling of the largest cave at Site 23. 23-D and E are on a large rock and the back wall respectively, low in the same cave. </p><br>

<p>23-F is in a small shelter below and to the right of the big cave at site 23. </p><br>

<p>24-A-1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are on the ceiling of a very small shelter on the level above Site 23. The shelter is too low to allow one to sit up in it comfortably. The designs are sharp but weak. </p><br>

<p>24-I is in the large shelter with 24-H. </p>
