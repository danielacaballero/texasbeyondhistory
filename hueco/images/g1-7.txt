<p>9-A and 9-B. These are in small pockets in the cliff about four feet from the ground. </p><br>

<p>9-C. These designs are on the ceiling of a small deep shelter under a very large boulder. The ceiling and walls of the shelter had been smoked black. The designs were not very clear. </p><br>

<p>9-D and 9-E. They are under two open shelters exposed to moisture and to flowing sand. The designs are very dim. </p><br>

<p>10-C. This design is unique because it is the only pictograph at Hueco Tanks containing green. It is on the ceiling of a small overhang about 9 feet above the ground and is in very good state of preservation. </p>
