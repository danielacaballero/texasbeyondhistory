<p>20-G is on the ceiling at the entrance to a deep tunnel like shelter. It is quite clear except on the right corner. </p><br>

<p>20-C is a large rock crack above and to the left of the main shelter. The designs in a blue gray paint are very dim. They are on the ceiling only about 3 feet above the bottom of the crevice. </p><br>

<p>20-L is just out side of a small shelter about 40 feet above and to right of the tunnel like shelter. The designs are exposed to the blowing rain and are so dim that they could hardly be copied. </p>
