<p>Site 6. This is the cave known locally as "Comanche Cave" containing the largest water tank at the location. The tank is about 40 feet back in the narrow cave and is almost completely covered by a huge flat rock. It is said never to have gone dry. The water is cold, clear, and sweet. On the walls of the cave are many names bearing dates of 1849, and later. Most of the pictures in the cave appear to be historic. One set of conspicuous pictures were not copied, although they look somewhat primitive, because they over painted some of the names. They pictured men wearing chaps with swords, riding horses, and were probably the work of white men. </p>
