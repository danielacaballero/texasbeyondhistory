<p>15-C. These snake designs are on the ceiling of a very large shelter at the point of the cliff. The ceiling is smoked and smeared with color but the original designs are destroyed. It appears that the snakes were never outlined here as they were in other shelters. </p><br>
<p>16-A. This design is on a low wall behind a large rock in a small unused shelter. It is so dim that it could only be copied with difficulty. </p><br>

<p>16-D. This is on the wall of a high shelter. It is painted with mud or clay. </p>
