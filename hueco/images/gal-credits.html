<p>The Forrest Kirkland Galleries section was developed from a web exhibit on the artist’s rock art paintings originally created for the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM) by Cary Steibel with the assistance of Sally Baulch and other TMM staff members. The original exhibit resided on the TMM website for several years before it was taken down in 2004 and made available to TARL. Forrest Kirkland’s original watercolors were also transferred to TARL. </p>
<p>The design and technology for this  presentation was originally created by TBH editorial assistant Erin Tyson and web designer Meg Kemp for Kirkland’s art of the Lower Pecos region, but has been modified and expanded by TBH web developer Heather Smith and Co-Editor Susan Dial  for Hueco Tanks. It features new scans of many of Kirkland’s original illustrations as well as other photographs and information. </p> 
<p>Most of the watercolor plates and Kirkland’s descriptions also appear in the 1967 book, The Rock Art of Texas Indians, reissued in 1996 and still in print. Readers familiar with the book will find that some of the plates that appear in black and white in the book can be found in color in this online exhibit. </p>
