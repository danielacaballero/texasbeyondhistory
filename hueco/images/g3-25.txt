<p>25-A and B are the main designs in a shallow poorly protected shelter. Most of the red color is still very bright and is probably not very old. </p><br>

<p>25-E is one of several very dim blanket designs under a small shelter near 25-A. Only these were judged clear enough to copy. </p><br>

<p>26-B is a deep cave high up the cliff at Site 26. </p>
