      <p class="text"><strong> Lesson Title</strong> : Drawing Our Lives:
Plains Indian Ledger Art Revisited
 </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Subject: </strong> Social Studies and Art</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level: </strong> 7th (can easily be adapted to 4th)</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Rationale or Purpose: </strong>This lesson illustrates how art can be used to chronicle important aspects of any given culture. </p>
       <p class="text"><strong> Introduction: </strong>Ledger art grew out of the Plains Indian custom of painting artistic images on buffalo hide robes and tipi covers. After western expansion forced Plains Indians onto U.S. government reservations, their traditional way of life began to pass into history. They preserved their culture, however, by drawing pictures of their past battles, heroic deeds, ceremonies, and everyday customs in ledger books. Today, ledger art is still a popular form of artistic expression for many American Indians. </p>

      <p class="text"><strong> Activity:</strong>      </p>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Review with students the elements of Plains Indian  culture by having them name elements of that culture aloud while you record  them on the board. (Examples may include dependence on buffalo for many of  their critical needs, such as food, skins for clothing; use of tipis for  shelter; etc.).</p>
      <p><strong>Step  2:</strong> Explain that before Plains Indians were forced onto  reservations by frontier expansion westward, they recorded elements of their  culture by drawing pictures of their  battles, heroic deeds, ceremonies, and everyday customs on their tipis and  buffalo robes. <br>
      Display images of <em>Kiowa  Tipi Covers</em>. Explain that with westward expansion, the U.S. government  tried to force Plains Indians onto reservations where they would no longer be  able to hunt buffalo.      </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Explain that students are going to view two primary source documents  related to the Plains Indians. Display the image of Satanta and his speech (given  at the Medicine  Lodge Treaty council in 1867) and  read aloud to students Satanta&rsquo;s account of being driven off his land by white Americans. Point out that once on reservations and unable to hunt buffalo any longer, Plains  Indians began recording aspects of their culture by drawing in ledger books  given to them by traders,  government agents, missionaries, and military officers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Display the webpage <em><a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/spotlights/ledgerart/ledger-art.html">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/spotlights/ledgerart/ledger-art.html</a></em>to  view examples of Plains Indian ledger drawings. Ask students the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Is any particular subject matter common to most of these drawings?</li>
  <li>What time period would you guess these drawings are from? Explain       your answer?</li>
  <li>What do you notice about the paper these pictures are drawn on and       the materials they&rsquo;re drawn with?</li>
  <li>Are the figures in these pictures drawn realistically? Explain.    </li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Point out that these Plains Indian artists had no formal artistic  training and many of their figures seem simplistic and out of proportion, almost  like stick figures. These artists had as their goal to record elements of their  culture before it changed forever as a result of being forced onto government  reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Display the ledger  drawing, &quot;<em>The Road to  Indian Market is Filled with Potholes</em>&rdquo; by Dolores Purdy Corcoran (2012).  Ask students if this drawing could have been created during the same time period  as the other drawings they viewed. Explain that it was obviously created much  later, as it contains trucks, which did not exist in the late 1800s when most early  ledger art was created. Ask students to volunteer explanations of what&rsquo;s going  on in this picture and what aspects of Indian culture are represented. Inform  them that today, many Indians sell their crafts at various Indian markets to  earn income. Point out that ledger art is a very popular form of Indian art  today and illustrates aspects of Indian culture both past and present.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Explain that students are going to  create a ledger drawing, but it won&rsquo;t include images of the Plains Indians.  Instead, they will illustrate part of <strong>their</strong> <strong>own</strong> culture that is important to them <strong>today</strong>. Give students the following  prompts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Imagine you are moving to a different  part of the world, or even a different planet, where everything will be new and  different. Your homes, schools, transportation, and technology will all be left  behind. What element(s) of your culture would you want to record in a drawing  to remember after you move?</li>
        <li>What is one important event in your  life you would like to portray in a drawing?</li>
        <li>Have students brainstorm aloud some  examples to answer these questions. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Distribute copies of the <em>Ledger Page</em> (or used paper documents)  and colored pencils to students. Explain that ledger art is always created on  paper that has been printed on and modern ledger art is sometimes drawn on newspapers,  concert tickets, etc. </p>
      <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Display the <em>Ledger  Art Project Grading Rubric</em> and  go over the assignment expectations with students. Suggest  students make a practice drawing before creating their final ledger drawing.  Reassure students that very little drawing ability is necessary for this  project - stick figures are just fine, but they should include as much detail  as possible. Instruct students to fill the page with their drawings and make  them very colorful.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> After completing their drawings, have  students write a paragraph explaining why they chose their ledger art subjects. </p>
  <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Collect drawings and explanatory  paragraphs. </p>
  <p><strong>Assessment: </strong>Use the<strong> </strong><em>Ledger Art Project  Grading </em>Rubric  to evaluate the ledger drawings and explanatory paragraphs </p>
  <p class="text"><strong>Modification: </strong> (for special learning needs) </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><u>Learning Disabled</u> - Have students       write only 2 sentences explaining their drawings.</li>
        <li><u>Gifted and       Talented</u> - Have students research the life and art of American Indian artist, Delores       Purdy Corcoran.<u> </u></li>
      </ul>
  <p><strong>Extension Activities: </strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
        <li>Have students       create a bulletin board display of their ledger art and essays. Have the       class observe the display carefully and discuss any themes that emerge in       it.</li>
        <li>Ask students to       compare ledger art to urban graffiti. How are the two mediums similar? How       are they different?</li>
        <li>Present the       lesson, <em>Whose Buffalo?</em> which       deals with Texas Plains Indians and their dependence on the buffalo. See       it at:<a href="../../redriver/images/rr-complete.pdf">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/redriver/images/rr-complete.pdf</a></li>
