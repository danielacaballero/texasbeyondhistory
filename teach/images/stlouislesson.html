<p class="text"> <strong>Lesson Title: </strong><br>Ft. St. Louis: A Do-It-Yourself History</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Subjects:</strong> Texas History and Geography, English Language Arts, Technology Education</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level: </strong> 7 (Can be adapted for grades 4-11) <br>
Teacher and students should have an understanding of some basic features of Microsoft Word (Save, Copy, Paste, Print, and the top menu bars) and be able to navigate the Internet.
</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Rationale:</strong>Students will work in cooperative groups to gather primary and secondary source materials from the Texas Beyond History website. They will then incorporate these materials into an illustrated history book about Fort St. Louis, the first French settlement in Texas.

<p class="text"><strong> Activity - Day 1 </strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Explain to students that one of  the Six Flags Over Texas is the Fleur-de-Lis, or French Flag, and that while  the early French settlement of Fort St. Louis was not ultimately successful, it  played a very important role in European exploration and settlement in Texas.</p>
      <p>Step 2: Advise students that they will  be researching the history of Fort St. Louis on the Internet and using the  research information they gather online to write books about Fort St. Louis.  Divide students into groups of 3 or 4. Distribute the Fort. St. Louis Grading  Criteria Sheet and go over it with students. Point out that in order to include  everything called for, students will have to divide up the various tasks  required among themselves. </p>
      <p>Step 3: In the computer lab or on  classroom computers, guide students to the Texas Beyond History (TBH) Fort St.  Louis website. Advise them that they may use any information on this site in  compiling their books, as long as they give credit to the appropriate authors.  They may cut and paste text, maps, pictures and diagrams and may print these to  help illustrate their books. </p>
      <p>Step 4: Distribute Fort St. Louis  Research Notes and instruct students that the information gathered for these notes  will be used in their book&rsquo;s Introduction. Have students complete their  research notes, using their textbooks and the TBH website to gather their  information.</p>
      <p><strong>Day 2 </strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Discuss the use of sources in  writing history. Describe primary and secondary sources (see vocabulary). Some  of the best information we have about Fort St. Louis can be found in the  journal (a primary source) of the French soldier and explorer, Henri Joutel.  Traveling to Texas from his native France, Joutel accompanied La Salle on every  step of their expedition to find the mouth of the Mississippi River in the New  World. After La Salle&rsquo;s murder by his own men, Joutel&nbsp; returned to France in 1688, taking his  journal with him. Explain to students that any primary source document found on  the TBH Fort St. Louis website is actually a source within a source, within a  source. As Henri Joutel&rsquo;s journal contains  accounts of events he actually witnessed, it is considered a <strong>primary source document</strong>. The book that  contains the translation of Henri Joutel&rsquo;s journal, <em>The La Salle  Expedition to Texas: The Journal of Henri Joutel, 1684-1687</em> (edited by historian William C. Foster), is a <strong>secondary source document</strong>,  because  it discusses information originally produced somewhere else after the  historical event took place. And that book is used  inside another <strong>secondary source document</strong> &ndash; the TBH website. (See <a href="../../stlouis/credits.html">Credits and  Sources</a> section of the Fort St. Louis exhibit). </p>
      <p>Point out that to earn a full 100  points on their books, students will have to use more than one primary source.  For help in citing bibliographic entries, see the following: <a href="http://www.mla.org/style_faq1" target="_blank">http://www.mla.org/style_faq1</a> </p>
      <p>Step 2: Explain that a great many  artifacts (see vocabulary) from Ft. St. Louis can tell us about life at the  settlement. Distribute the Fort St. Louis Artifact Analysis Sheets, one per  group. Explain that the information on the sheet will describe an artifact  students find on the TBH Fort St. Louis site. The completed sheet will be  included in their book.</p>
      <p>Step 3: Have students continue their  research. Remind them to periodically refer to their Grading Criteria Sheet to  keep track of the points they&rsquo;re accumulating.</p>
      <p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
      <p>Step 1: Have students complete their  research and assemble their books, checking their Grading Criteria Sheets to  make sure they have all necessary information. Student books can be as simple  as a stapled collection of all their papers, or a more elaborate handmade book.  For directions on making handmade books, see: <a href="http://www.dickblick.com/lessonplans/handmadebooks/" target="_blank">http://www.dickblick.com/lessonplans/handmadebooks/</a></p>
      <p><strong>Lesson  Closure: </strong>Ask  students the following question: &ldquo;After conducting your research, how do you  think Fort St. Louis affected future European exploration and settlement in  Texas?&rdquo; Have them explain their answers. Then point out that even though the  settlement and most of its inhabitants didn&rsquo;t survive, it&rsquo;s existence spurred  Spanish interest in settling Texas. Then ask how Texas might have been  different today if the French had been much more successful in Texas. Possible  answers include: more French spoken in Texas, more Texas French place names,  such as cities, rivers, counties, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Vocabulary:</strong><br>
          <u>Artifact</u> &ndash; anything created or altered by humans<br><br>
          <u>Primary sources</u> &ndash; documents or physical objects which  were written or created during the time under study. Some types of primary  sources include diaries, letters, official records, poetry, art and artifacts  (pottery, furniture, clothing, buildings, etc.)<br><br>
          <u>Secondary sources</u> &ndash; These are usually documents that  discuss information originally produced somewhere else after the historical  event has taken place. Secondary sources may have pictures, quotes, or graphics  of primary sources in them. Textbooks, histories, journals, magazine articles,  and websites are the most common secondary sources.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Modification: </strong>Give students more  time to complete their books.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Student  Product:</strong> Illustrated book about Fort St. Louis<br>
