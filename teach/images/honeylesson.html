  </ul>
      <p><strong> Activity: </strong></p>
      <p> Step 1: Introduce students to the Edwards Plateau region of Texas where
        the Honey Creek archeological site is located by displaying the Honey
        Creek Map Transparency. Point out that the Honey Creek site is in the
        Edwards Plateau region of Texas, an area of limestone hills, and many
        creeks. </p>
      <p> Step 2: Inform students that the Honey Creek site was visited intermittently
        by prehistoric nomadic hunting and gathering peoples from Late Paleoindian
        times (around 7,000 B.C., or 9,000 years ago) to historic times. Point
        out that these groups of Native Americans were not, for the most part,
        yet organized into the familiar tribes we know today, such as the Apache
        and Comanche.</p>
      <p> Step 3: Distribute the What&rsquo;s Cookin&rsquo; at Honey Creek? student
        handout. Read page 1 of it aloud with students.</p>
      <p> Step 4: Log onto the to the Texas Beyond History website at <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net">www.texasbeyondhistory.net</a></p>
      <p> Step 5: Click on Honey Creek on the interactive map.</p>
      <p>  Step 6: Have students complete page 2 of the handout, using the Texas
      Beyond History exhibit, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s for Dinner?&rsquo; at <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/dinner/index.html">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/dinner/index.html</a>.</p>
      <p><strong> Modification: </strong> Fill in 3 or 4 of the 7 sequenced steps
        on the student handout.</p>
      <p><strong> Student Product: </strong> Completed What&rsquo;s Cookin&rsquo; at
        Honey Creek? student handout</p>
      <p><strong> Closure: </strong> Ask students to list as many modern cooking
        methods as they can. Answers may include gas and electric stoves, microwaves,
        convection ovens, gas and charcoal grills, toasters, etc. Then ask them
        to predict how foods might be cooked 100 years from now. 1,000 years
        from now?</p>
      <p><strong> Assessment or evaluation: </strong> Have students read their
        sequencing answers aloud and check each other&rsquo;s work. The correct
        answers are in the following sequence: 5,4,9,6,2,10,1,7,3,8</p>
