<p class="text"> <strong>Lesson Title: </strong><br>
      After Slavery: Exercising the Rights of Citizenship in 19th-Century Texas </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Subjects:</strong> Texas History and Geography </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level: </strong> 7th (can be adapted for grades 4 – 8) </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Rationale:</strong> Students will explore a variety of county government
records to learn how Ransom Williams, an African American living in post-Civil
War Texas, began the transition to freedom by exercising the right to vote and
own property. Students will work with partners to analyze a 19th-century primary
source document, then create their own county government documents and
answer questions about Ransom Williams and the functions of county
government.</p>

       <p><strong>NOTE: Prior to beginning activity, teacher will:<br>
       </strong></p>
        <ul> <li>Familiarize students with all necessary technology tools and applications.</li>
        <li> Print out copies of: Analyzing A Written Primary Source Document form

       </p>
       <p><strong>Directions for the teacher</strong>: 
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
         <p>Step 1: Display the Web exhibit (<a href="../../ransom/index.html" target="_blank">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/ransom/index.html</a>) and briefly go over main titles and pictures with students.</p>
        <p> Explain that as they learn about the life of Ransom Williams, an African-American
         freedman living in post-Civil War Texas, they will discover how the functions of
         his county government helped him succeed as a citizen and property owner. </p>
         <p>Step 2: Display the 1860 Slave Schedule. This document illustrates how 
         enslaved African Americans were listed only by age, gender, and color on U.S.
         Census Rolls. Point to the names of the slave owners, and show that the names 
         of the slaves themselves were not given, only a number and description. After 
         emancipation, most former slaves had to establish a legal identity of their own. </p>
        <p> Step 3: Display the Travis County 1925 Property Plat Map. Explain that during slavery, African Americans themselves were 
         owned as property. After slavery, freedmen like Ransom Williams managed to 
         buy their own land. To prove ownership of his land, he registered his property 
         deed at his county courthouse. This plat is one county record of Ransom 
         Williams&rsquo; land ownership. </p>
        <p> Step 4: Display Ransom Williams&rsquo; Property Tax Record. Point out that this document recorded Williams' legal ownership of 
his land, horses, and wagon as well as his property&rsquo;s value. </p>
         <p>Step 5: Display the Texas Voter Registration Application (included and available 
         on your county website). Point out that all Texas 
         voters must register to vote and that in most Texas counties, the County Tax 
         Assessor-Collector is also the County Voter Registrar. Briefly go over the 
         application questions aloud with students. Ask why so much information is 
 required of voter registrants. </p>
        <p> Step 6: Display the Ransom Williams&rsquo; Voter Registration document on the 
         Interactive Whiteboard. Explain that as slaves, African Americans could not vote 
         or hold office. Becoming a registered voter gave Ransom Williams a legal identity 
         that he hadn&rsquo;t had as a slave. </p>
         <p>Step 7: Display a copy of the 1870s Mark &amp; Brand Record  (or distribute downloaded copies to students). Explain that Ransom 
         Williams owned mules and horses, and wanted to be able to prove that they were 
his. </p>
         <p>Step 8: Have students choose a partner to work with. Distribute copies of 
         Analyzing A Written Primary Source Document to students. Explain that a 
         primary source document is one that was created at the time under study, (e.g., 
         this document was created during the lifetime of Ransom Williams). Read the 
         questions aloud with students and have them complete the form with their 
         partners. </p>
        <p> Step 9: Students turn in completed Analyzing A Written Primary Source 
         Document forms to teacher. </p>
        <p> Step 10: Display Ransom Williams&rsquo; Horse Brand photo (included) and explain 
         that it was one of thousands of artifacts found on the Williams&rsquo; farmstead site. 
         Point out that this brand was most likely a discard, as it is backwards (the shank 
         was on the wrong side) and it doesn&rsquo;t display the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shown on his brand 
         application. The complete brand was registered at Williams&rsquo; county courthouse. </p>
         <p>Step 11: Ask students to create a working definition of the word &quot;ownership&quot;. Then 
         have them make a list of everything they, themselves, own. Ask them how they 
         can prove ownership of each of their belongings. Point out that proving 
         ownership of items can be difficult and in order to prove ownership of our 
         vehicles, homes, and properties, we must register them with the government and 
         pay taxes on them. </p>
         <p><strong>Day 2 </strong></p>
         <p>Step 1: Have students pair up again with their partners. </p>
         <p>Step 2: Distribute copies of the Ransom Williams: A Nineteenth-Century Travis 
         County Citizen form. Read the questions aloud with students. Have them use the 
         Internet to help them answer the form&rsquo;s questions and complete their brand 
         registration forms. </p>
        <p> Step 3. Have students attach their Ransom Williams: A Nineteenth Century 
         Travis County Citizen form to their downloaded and printed Mark and Brand 
         Record and turn them in to the teacher. </p>
         <p>Step 4: Ask students to volunteer examples of services that their county 
         provides. Possible correct answers may include: birth, marriage, and death 
         records; land deeds and deed transfers; property tax and foreclosure records; 
         livestock brand registrations; sheriff and sheriff deputies services; county court 
         and jury information; child and adult protective services; automobile title 
         transfers; etc. </p>
         <p>Step 5: Explain that in the 19th century, county government was the most useful 
         form of government to citizens because it directly influenced their everyday lives 
         and was usually the closest government office to them geographically. Today, 
         federal and state governments are important, too, but county governments 
         continue to serve many vital functions. 
         Modifications: For students with specific learning needs or IEPs, have step-by-step 
         instructions for the computer and all necessary applications available and 
         allow more time for completing forms, if necessary. </p>
