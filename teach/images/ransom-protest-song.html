<p class="text"> <strong>Lesson Title: </strong><br>
      Writing Contemporary Protest Songs</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Subjects:</strong> American History </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level:</strong> 8th- Can easily be adapted to other grade levels</p>
<p class="text"><strong> Rationale: </strong>Throughout American history, protest songs with value messages have been used  to form and change public opinion on social and political issues. This lesson  deals with the evolution of a 19th century song and describes the importance of  music as social commentary.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In this lesson,  students will work in small groups to examine a folk song and a protest song  that share the same melody but have different lyrics. Students will write their  own protest song lyrics to the tune of these two songs, based on a current  event they have researched. They will then perform and record their songs.</p>

<p class="text"><strong> Lesson Duration: </strong>Two 45 minute class periods or one 90 minute block</p>
<p class="text"><strong> Objectives: </strong>&nbsp;In this lesson students will research  a current event of social or political importance and write protest song lyrics  related to that event.</p>
<p><strong>Activity: Day 1</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Step1: </strong>Explain to students that  American music has always included protest songs, written in reaction to  situations or events that some musicians disapproved of and wanted to change.  These songs were written to influence public opinion, and in the 1960s a great  many protest songs became very popular. Explain that in this lesson students  will identify and research an issue they feel strongly about and want to  protest, and then write song lyrics to accompany their research information.</p>
         <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Explain to students that  in this lesson they will examine a song that has two different sets of lyrics  but the same melody and they will use this same melody for their protest songs.  Explain that before copyright laws existed, song melodies were often recycled  with new lyrics. This process, known as <em>contrafactum</em>,  occurs when the lyrics of a song are re-written as a different song (or  vice-versa). </p>
         <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Distribute the <em>Old Dan Tucker</em> &nbsp;lyricsand  read them aloud with students. Explain that this folk song was probably written  around 1820, became very popular, and was first published anonymously in 1843.  Since then, hundreds of different verses have been recorded and are still being  sung and recorded today. Discuss the lyrics to <em>Old Dan Tucker</em> by asking the following: Does this song have a social or  political message? If so, what is it? </p>
         <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Play the following <em>Old Dan Tucker</em> video clip, reminding  students that their protest song will use this same melody. After playing the  clip, ask students if <em>Old Dan Tucker</em> sounds like a protest song. Why or why not?</p>

         <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Distribute the  lyrics to <em>Get Off The Track!</em> Explain  that in the 1840s, a political movement called abolitionism called for an end  to slavery. New words for the song <em>Old  Dan Tucker</em> were written by Jesse  Hutchinson, who wanted to abolish slavery. This new song became known as <em>Get Off The Track!, </em>a protest song<em>. </em>Display the cover to the<em> Get Off The Track! </em>sheet music. </p>
         <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Have students view  an illustrated, online performance of <em>Get  Off The Track! </em>(2.53 minutes long) at:<br>
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfKsjeTvKLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfKsjeTvKLs</a></p>
         <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Discuss the lyrics  to <em>Get Off The Track! </em>by asking the  following questions:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>What does the song title mean, and how does it relate to the song  lyrics? </li>
           <li>Did this song&rsquo;s author have a social or political message? If so,  what is it? </li>
           <li>Do you agree or disagree with what he&rsquo;s saying? Why? </li>
           <li>How did this song make you feel? Did you feel that it was  expressing feelings that are similar to your own? </li>
           <li>Do you think this song is more of a protest song than <em>Old Dan Tucker</em>? Why or why not?</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Have students get  into groups of 2 or 3. Distribute the <em>Writing  Contemporary Protest Songs Graphic Organizer </em>(one per group) and read it  aloud with students. Remind students that the song <em>Get Off The Track!</em> took a stand on the social and political issue  of abolitionism. Instruct students that the new lyrics they write for this song  must also take a stand on a current social or political issue, and their lyrics  should try to persuade listeners to agree with their opinion.</p>
         <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Ask students to  brainstorm current issues they might want to protest in their songs. What  issues make them angry or dissatisfied? Write their responses down for all to  see. Some examples might be war, civil rights, environmentalism, economic  injustice, hunger and poverty, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Provide newspapers,  news magazines, and/or the Internet as resources with which students can choose  an event and fill out the graphic organizer.</p>
         <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Have students get in  their groups and fill out items 1-3 on their graphic organizers. When all are  done, collect graphic organizers and song lyrics for tomorrow&rsquo;s use.         </p>
         <p><strong>Activity: Day 2</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Have students get  back into their groups. Redistribute graphic organizers and song lyrics.</p>
         <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Review lesson  objectives.<strong></strong></p>
         <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Have students work with  their group members to write the lyrics to their protest songs. Suggest they  make at least one draft before they record their lyrics on their graphic  organizer.</p>
         <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Have students  perform and record their songs. If possible, share them with the class by  syncing them into a projector.</p>
         <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Discuss the  following with students:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Is music an effective medium for expressing social  and/or political ideas? Why or why not?</li>
           <li>What was difficult about writing song lyrics?</li>
           <li>What was  easy about it? </li>
           <li>Which  parts were harder to compose, the verses or the chorus? Why?</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Ask students to give examples of current protest songs that deal with  important social or political issues.</p>
         <p><strong>Modification for  special learning needs:</strong><br>
           <u>Learning Disabled</u><br>
  &bull; Help students highlight pertinent parts of their current event.<br>
  &bull; Require fewer lines of verse and chorus.<br>
  <u>Gifted and Talented</u><br>
  &bull; Have students research the origins of contrafactum and give other  historical examples of it.</p>
         <p><strong>Closure:</strong> Ask students what  would happen today if they tried to publish a song using their own lyrics but  someone else&rsquo;s music.</p>
         <p><strong>Assessment:</strong></p>
         <ul>
           <li>Completed graphic organizers with student-written song  lyrics.</li>
           <li>Recordings of student-written songs.</li>
         </ul>
<p><strong>Extension Activities</strong></p>
         <ul>
           <li>Have  students tear off the bottom of the graphic organizer where their protest message  is written and share their lyrics with other students. Have the other students  try to guess what the protest message is from reading the lyrics.         </li>
         </ul>
         <ul>
           <li>Ask students what section of the U.S. Constitution  allows us to write songs about whatever topic we choose. Answer: The Bill of  Rights, Amendment 1 - &ldquo;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment  of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom  of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,  and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&rdquo;<strong></strong></li>
