          <td valign="top"> <p class="text">The companion exhibit, <a href="../hank1/index.html" class="text">Hank's 
              House 1: Anatomy of a Burned Pithouse</a>, tells all about how the 
              house was found and investigated, what it contained, what it looked 
              like, when it was built and burned, and so on. In Hank's House 2 
              we turn to the bigger picture and the problem of trying to fit Hank's 
              house into what is known about the Plains villagers of the Texas 
              Panhandle. The story that follows&#151;<strong>A Puzzle Wrapped in a 
              Mystery</strong>&#151;gives insight into the thought processes of the 
              archeologists as they worked to unravel the story of Hank's house. 
              It also shows how perceptions can change as new and important data 
              come to light. </p>
            <p class="text">This exhibit departs from the usual <em>Texas Beyond 
              History </em>format. It is an interpretive essay that relies more 
              on words and ideas than images and we've chosen to keep it together 
              as a narrative. Author <strong>John R. Erickson</strong> is the 
              rancher and professional writer who found the site on the M-Cross 
              Ranch that he and wife Kris Erickson own in Roberts County. Doug 
              Boyd, the archeologist who directed the work at Hank's site has 
              this to say about Erickson:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text">The reader should know that John is the kind of 
                guy who doesn't do anything half way. So, when he got interested 
                in the archeology on his ranch, he jumped in with both feet. He 
                began reading everything he could get his hands on. The more he 
                read, the more questions he asked. Within a couple years he had 
                managed to wade through most of the important archeological literature 
                for the region, had engaged in discussions with many professional 
                and avocational archeologists in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, 
                and had obtained a good working knowledge of the prehistory of 
                the region. While Erickson says he is a &quot;greenhorn&quot; 
                when it comes to Panhandle archeology, he has a knack for cutting 
                to the chase and asking the most important questions. His nonacademic, 
                no-nonsense outsider's perspective, honed from many years as a 
                cowboy, rancher, writer, and Jack-of-all-trades is refreshing 
                and thought provoking. More than once he has asked a particularly 
                insightful question and made a whole room of seasoned archeologists 
                pause awkwardly as they stammered for some answer that wouldn't 
                sound ridiculous. More often than not, the answer was simply, 
                &quot;I don't know. I never thought about that before!&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text">As you read the below story, perhaps you will think 
              about things that you have never thought about before. Please remember 
              that the archeological investigation of Hank's site is a story unfolding. 
              Most archeological endeavors are, in fact, a series of ongoing learning 
              processes for which there is no real end. Perhaps the most important 
              thing that can be gained from years of studying Panhandle archeology 
              and prehistory is a great appreciation for its many complexities. 
              No matter how long you have studied, and how much you know, most 
              Panhandle archeologists eventually come to realize that we are all 
              merely greenhorns and have much to learn about the cultures who 
              called this place home.</p>
            <h2 align="center">A Puzzle Wrapped in a Mystery </h2>
            <p class="text">To appreciate the significance of Hank's house, we 
              begin with a brief review of Southern Plains archeology in general, 
              as our archeological team understood it at the time the excavation 
              began in November of 2000. This is important because, as we will 
              see, Hank's house exposed some gaps in the overall picture of archeology 
              in the Texas Panhandle. </p>
            <p class="text">To understand who might who might have lived at Hank's 
              house, we must look at three variables simultaneously: time, space, 
              and culture. Between about A.D. 1200 and 1450, the Canadian River 
              Valley of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma was inhabited 
              by several groups of Plains Village peoples. The Texas and Oklahoma 
              Panhandles were home to the <strong>Antelope Creek</strong> culture, 
              and their core area was centered around the section of the Canadian 
              River that is now Lake Meredith. In the northeastern corner of the 
              Texas Panhandle and covering large portions of Ochiltree and Lipscomb 
              counties, <strong>Buried City</strong> peoples lived along Wolf 
              Creek, a tributary to the Canadian River. A little further to the 
              west, in the northwestern corner of Oklahoma, archeologists recognize 
              the <strong>Zimms</strong> complex. Just south of that, the <strong>Turkey 
              Creek</strong> phase (formerly the western section of the Washita 
              River phase). Beyond this, scholars recognize many other similar 
              cultural manifestations in adjacent states, but only two are mentioned 
              here because they come into our story later. To the northwest is 
              the <strong>Apishapa</strong> phase (southeastern Colorado) and 
              farther to the north is the <strong>Upper Republican</strong> phase 
              (Kansas and Nebraska). Each of these names, which are usually called 
              &quot;phases&quot; or &quot;complexes&quot; by archeologists, is 
              thought to represent a distinct &quot;culture&quot; or group of 
              people. They all share many traits in common, but are distinguished 
              by differences in material culture, architecture, burial practices, 
              and even skeletal characteristics. </p>
            <p class="text">All of the groups mentioned above had common traits 
              that identified them as Southern Plains Villagers and distinguish 
              them from the Plains Woodland cultures that preceded them. They 
              made pottery and hunted bison with arrows tipped with side-notched 
              points. They relied to some extent on the gathering of wild plants, 
              but also cultivated corn and other crops in garden plots. And, most 
              important, they had evolved from the pattern of nomadic hunting 
              and gathering followed by their early ancestors and lived in small 
              hamlets and villages&#8212;thus the name &quot;Plains Villagers.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">The appearance of villages on the Southern Plains 
              introduced a new diagnostic element into Southern Plains archeology: 
              <strong>architecture</strong>. Where earlier cultural groups, the 
              Archaic and Woodland peoples, had sheltered themselves in ledge 
              caves and temporary pithouse dwellings that archeologist have difficultly 
              finding, the Plains Villagers built more substantial houses, the 
              ruins of which have, in many cases, survived into the twentieth 
              century to be excavated and studied by archeologists (and dug into 
              more haphazardly by treasure seekers). These houses came in different 
              sizes and shapes: small, large, circular, square, and rectangular; 
              some were single-room structures, while others contained multiple 
              rooms. Hence, the analysis of house design and structure is an important 
              component in the overall interpretation of the various Southern 
              Plains Village cultures, offering some clues as to how one group 
              might or might not be related to another.</p>
            <p class="text">Architecture is one of the things that remains most 
              distinctive of cultures all around the world today, and the history 
              of architecture is an exciting field of study. It is not at all 
              surprising that modern historical architects trace specific architectural 
              traits through time and across space in order to understand movements 
              of different groups and the influences they have had on others. 
              This same concept applies to the archeological remains of buildings 
              and structures, including those in the Texas Panhandle.</p>
            <p class="text">Although the Southern Plains Village groups shared 
              some common traits in their house architecture, the prehistoric 
              structures in the Texas Panhandle had two features that made them 
              unique. First, most of the houses contained walls and foundations 
              made of stone-vertical slabs in the Antelope Creek culture houses 
              near Amarillo, Texas, and round caliche rocks in the Buried City 
              complex southeast of Perryton, Texas. And second, all rectangular 
              prehistoric structures in the Panhandle had a central channel running 
              through the middle of the house, with raised &quot;benches&quot; 
              on either side and, usually, a raised &quot;altar&quot; at the rear. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">At the time we began the excavation on Hank's house, 
              Plains Village archeology in the Panhandle usually meant <strong>Antelope 
              Creek</strong>, whose extensive stone-slab ruins along the Canadian 
              River south of Amarillo had fascinated archeologists for almost 
              a century. With such a wealth of sites with shallowly buried houses 
              easily identified by the structural rocks poking above the surface 
              (and, coincidentally, very vulnerable to destruction by pot hunters 
              and oil field construction), it is hardly surprising that archeologists 
              concentrated their excavations on the stone ruins that occurred 
              in a four-county (Moore, Potter, Hutchinson, and Oldham) area around 
              the <a href="../../alibates/index.html" class="text">Alibates flint 
              quarries</a>, the heart of the Antelope Creek manifestation.</p>
            <p class="text">Studies of Antelope Creek sites proliferated, authored 
              by Ele and Jewel Baker, T.C. Holden, Floyd Studer, Lathel Duffield, 
              Alex Krieger, F. Earl Green, David Baerreis, Reid Bryson, Billy 
              Harrison, Jack T. Hughes, and others, and culminated in the publication 
              in 1986 of Christopher Lintz's monumental study <em>Architecture 
              and Community Variability Within the Antelope Creek Phase of the 
              Texas Panhandle</em>.</p>
            <p class="text">Work had also been done on the smaller cluster of 
              ruins at <a href="../buriedcity/index.html" class="text">Buried 
              City</a> in the northeastern Panhandle, and this was the location 
              of one of the earliest scientific excavations in Texas. In 1906, 
              Professor T. L. Eyerly and his students from the Canadian Academy, 
              of Canadian, Texas, became the first of many to dig there. But the 
              work at Buried City didn't compare in volume to the research devoted 
              to Antelope Creek sites. Even as late as the 1990s, when archeologists 
              made cultural maps of the Panhandle, they showed the circle of Antelope 
              Creek occupation covering the entire Panhandle, from New Mexico 
              on the west to Oklahoma on the east, while the Buried City complex 
              occupied a small balloon within the larger circle. Buried City was 
              recognized as representing something different, but exactly what 
              that was wasn't clear.</p>
            <p class="text"><a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/villagers/hank1/index.html" class="text">Hank's site</a> is located on a ranch in Roberts County, 
              fifty or sixty miles east of the heaviest concentration of Antelope 
              Creek village sites, but well within the circle of suspected Antelope 
              Creek occupation. Everything we knew about Panhandle archeology 
              convinced us that Hank's house would reveal ties to Antelope Creek 
              sites up the river. </p>
            <p class="text">Since our first radiocarbon date suggested an occupation 
              around 1100 A.D., and since the structure we uncovered was of picket-post 
              wall construction, not the stone-slab architecture of Antelope Creek, 
              our working hypothesis at this point suggested that: 1) the occupants 
              of Hank's house were ancestors of the Antelope Creek people; and 
              2) picket-post construction was an early manifestation of building 
              that later evolved into the stone-slab architecture of Antelope 
              Creek. </p>
            <h3> The Origins of Antelope Creek</h3>
            <p class="text">This drew us into the realm of the Great Unanswered 
              Question in Texas Panhandle archeology: <strong>Where did the Antelope 
              Creek people come from?</strong> Or, to put it another way, how and why 
              did they end up in the valley of the Canadian River sometime between 
              1200 and 1250 A.D. with a fully developed Plains Village culture-hunting 
              bison, growing corn, and building substantial stone houses and villages?</p>
            <p class="text">Archeologists have puzzled about this for nearly a 
              century, at least since Professor Eyerly excavated at the Buried 
              City in 1906. When Warren K. Moorehead made his trek across the 
              Panhandle in 1920, he recorded more than a hundred stone-ruin sites. 
              Moorehead and other investigators believed that the distinctive 
              stone masonry in the Panhandle pointed to a strong influence from 
              the Pueblos of the Southwest, and for years the ruins were attributed 
              to a group of people called the <strong>Pueblo Culture of the Texas 
              Panhandle</strong>. But once archeological excavations began in 
              earnest, investigators found more evidence of links to Plains Village 
              groups than to the Pueblos.</p>
            <p class="text">The debate about Antelope Creek origins has centered 
              on two questions: Did they evolve out of local Woodland groups? 
              Or, did Plains Village people migrate into the Panhandle from other 
              areas?</p>
            <p class="text">In 1962 Jack Hughes published the results of an investigation 
              he did at the <strong>Lake Creek</strong> site in Hutchinson County. 
              The Lake Creek site, he argued, provided evidence of a Woodland 
              group that was present in the Canadian River valley before the appearance 
              of Antelope Creek. Antelope Creek people, he said latter in a 1991 
              article, were rooted in Lake Creek and evolved out of an indigenous 
              Plains Woodland horizon, &quot;with cultural infusions from Mogollon, 
              Anasazi, and Upper Republican sources.&quot; </p>
            <p class="text">Robert Campbell, a scholar who did his doctoral research 
              on the Chaquaqua Plateau of southeastern Colorado, proposed a different 
              scenario in his 1976 book, <em>The Panhandle Aspect of the Chaquaqua 
              Plateau</em>. Campbell argued that around 1200 A.D., a Plains Village 
              group called <strong>Apishapa</strong> came under the spell of a 
              prolonged drought and migrated south and east into the Canadian 
              River valley, bringing with them their knowledge of stone masonry. 
              In the Texas Panhandle, they came in contact with local Woodland 
              groups (Hughes's Lake Creek folks) who had learned rectangular house-building 
              techniques from Custer or Washita River people from the east. Out 
              of this mingling of cultures and ideas, Campbell argued, came Antelope 
              Creek, and its &quot;Type I&quot; rectangular houses with walls 
              and foundations made of stone. (Type I is the designation Christopher 
              Lintz gave to the most common house style in Antelope Creek sites).</p>
            <p class="text">Campbell's model of Antelope Creek origins was elegant 
              in its simplicity and intuitively satisfying. Where did the stone 
              masonry come from? The Apishapa. Why did the Apishapa move into 
              the Panhandle? Drought. Where did the Type I rectangular house come 
              from? The Washita River people. Why did they come into the Panhandle? 
              They had hunted and foraged there for years, maybe centuries, and 
              some of them decided to stay. When the Type I house with post walls 
              met Apishapa stone masons in the central Panhandle, the classic 
              Type I rectangular houses with slab foundations appeared.</p>
            <p class="text">But two years after the publication of Campbell's 
              book, his migration theory drew a withering critique from a very 
              formidable opponent, Christopher Lintz. In a 1978 paper called &quot;Architecture 
              and Radiocarbon Dating of the Antelope Creek Focus: A Test of Campbell's 
              Model,&quot; Lintz attacked the Campbell model, arguing that a thorough 
              analysis of Antelope Creek radiocarbon dates did not support Campbell's 
              migration theory. He stated: &quot;Although this model fits well 
              with the phylogenic relationship proposed between Apishapa and Antelope 
              Creek foci, the chronological evidence supporting the architectural 
              changes in Antelope Creek has been selectively represented. Far 
              more chronological information could have been used to develop the 
              model.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">Although some observers have wondered about the reliability 
              of those carbon dates, many of which were made decades ago when 
              the science of carbon dating was in its infancy, Lintz's critique 
              cast a dark shadow over the Campbell model, and today one seldom 
              hears about it.</p>
            <p class="text">How, then, did Lintz explain the appearance and development 
              of Antelope Creek focus in the Panhandle? In his 1984 PhD dissertation 
              (published in 1986) he refuted theories that Antelope Creek derived 
              from migrations of Upper Republican, &quot;Southwestern groups,&quot; 
              &quot;late Gibson aspect Caddoans to the east,&quot; the Apishapa 
              to the northwest, Custer-Washita groups, or various combinations 
              of these.</p>
            <p class="text">Instead, he chose Jack Hughes's hypothesis that Antelope 
              Creek &quot;may have developed gradually out of Woodland under Basketmaker 
              influences to the west and Hopwellian and Gibson influences to the 
              east.&quot; Lintz called this: </p>
            <div class="timelinetext"> 
              <p>A persuasive argument based on (Hughes's) extensive familiarity 
                with the Texas panhandle archeology. ...The Lake Creek complex, 
                an indigenous Plains Woodland adaptation in the Texas Panhandle, 
                is regarded as a likely antecedent of the Antelope Creek phase&#133;Antelope 
                Creek thus reflects the introduction of new architectural ideas 
                around the same time that the local Woodland group was being transformed 
                into a Plains Village complex.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Picket-Post Architecture</h3>
            <p class="text">Lintz and Hughes, two of the most respected authorities 
              on Panhandle archeology, had come down on the side of an <strong>Indigenous 
              Development hypothesis</strong>: Antelope Creek grew out of Woodland 
              roots. But our team at Hank's site was having a problem fitting our 
              1100 A.D. picket-post structure into this scenario. It bothered 
              us that, more than forty years after Hughes had proposed his Lake 
              Creek complex, nobody had found any kind of structures in Lake Creek 
              sites. No one had found any firm evidence that explained how Woodland 
              people made the huge leap, presumably from simple pithouses (basically 
              holes in the ground covered with branches and animal skins) to the 
              elaborate architecture found in Antelope Creek villages. At the 
              time Hughes wrote his article on Lake Creek (1962), he believed 
              that the evidence would turn up in subsequent excavations, but that 
              has not happened.</p>
            <p class="text">Even though Robert Campbell's migration model had 
              been discredited and largely forgotten, we felt that it offered 
              a plausible answer to our biggest question


 - what was an 1100 A.D. 
              picket-post house doing in Roberts County, halfway between Antelope 
              Creek and Washita River habitation sites? Campbell's answer, which 
              our team dubbed the <strong>Oklahoma hypothesis</strong>, argued 
              that Custer-Washita River groups migrated westward up the Washita 
              and Canadian Rivers, established outposts in the Texas Panhandle, 
              merged with Apishapa stone masons, and blended into the complex 
              that became Antelope Creek.</p>
            <p class="text">What we uncovered at Hank's site was almost an exact 
              copy of the <strong>Type I </strong>structure Lintz had documented 
              at many Antelope Creek locations: rectangular, four interior support 
              posts, central hearth, an east-facing entryway, and a central channel 
              flanked by benches. The similarities were striking, but so were 
              the differences. Hank's house had no raised &quot;altar&quot; opposite 
              the entryway, but this feature is not always present in Type I Antelope 
              Creek houses. More important, there wasn't a single rock in the 
              foundation or walls of Hank's house. Stone-slab masonry was the 
              most conspicuous diagnostic element in Antelope Creek architecture, 
              yet the walls of our house had been constructed of vertical <strong>picket 
              posts</strong>, similar to what archeologists would call &quot;wattle 
              and daub.&quot; In wattle and daub architecture, vertical posts 
              are set into the ground and horizontal branches are lashed to them 
              to form a lattice framework. Grass or thatch is woven throughout 
              the lattice frame, and wet clay is applied to the interior and exterior. 
              When it dries, the clay binds and forms an adobe-like wall that 
              is very strong because it is bonded to strong wooden posts. A true 
              wattle and daub house is an above-ground structure, while Hank's 
              house was a semi-subterranean earth lodge-like a half dugout with 
            an earthen roof-that had picket-post walls.</p>
            <p class="text">Picket-post construction was rare in the Panhandle. 
              Some forty miles to the west of Hank's house, Billy Harrison and 
              the West Texas State University Anthropological Society had excavated 
              a picket-post house at the Jack Allen site. Another picket-post 
              structure had been documented at a site called Footprint, in the 
              heart of the Antelope Creek occupation zone. These two structures 
              had been known to archeologists for decades, but had always been 
              regarded as anomalies-variants of the standard stone-slab architectural 
              of Antelope Creek. (Note to readers: when archeologists find things 
              that don't fit their models, they call them anomalies or variants!)</p>
            <p class="text">But we had found another picket-post house at Hank's 
              Site. Could they all be &quot;variants?&quot; Architecturally, the 
              Jack Allen house is a dead ringer for Hank's house, and it is noteworthy 
              that Billy Harrison recognized that the lack of wall rocks was so 
              unusual. In an unpublished manuscript written in 1983, Harrison 
              stated that, &quot;This house and others like it may form a new 
              style of architecture for the Antelope Creek focus.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">The research team embarked on an extensive literature-search 
              on the subject of picket-post architecture. We searched the literature 
              from adjoining states, especially Oklahoma. Poring over the research 
              of Richard Drass, Peggy Flynn, Robert Bell, Robert Brooks, Jack 
              Hofman, Don Wycoff, and other Oklahoma scholars, we found numerous 
              references to picket-post houses that began at the hundredth meridian 
              (the Texas-Oklahoma state line) and extended all the way into the 
              heart of the state, most of them located on the Washita River and 
              its tributaries.</p>
            <p class="text">Some of the houses from Custer (southwestern Oklahoma) 
              and Paoli (south-central Oklahoma) phase sites were old enough to 
              be transitional-Woodland structures, while others, from the Turkey 
              Creek (southwestern Oklahoma) and Washita River (south-central Oklahoma) 
              phases, and the Zimms complex (northwestern Oklahoma), appeared 
              to be contemporaneous with Antelope Creek sites. In many cases, 
              the similarities to Hank's house were striking. Type I picket-post 
              structures at Currie 4, Patton A, Goodman I, Heerwald, Zimms 2, 
              and Hedding began to suggest a cultural affiliation between Hank's 
              house and the well-developed Plains Village cultures in western 
              and central Oklahoma.</p>
            <p class="text">A search of Upper Republican literature showed more 
              of the same. Although the Upper Republican houses in Kansas and 
              Nebraska are generally considered to &quot;earth lodges&quot; of 
              various forms and sizes, many of these houses were essentially Type 
              I picket-post structures very similar to Hank's house but generally 
              larger.</p>
            <p class="text">Our next objective was to take a closer look at excavations 
              and survey work that had been done in our own back yard, the eastern 
              Texas Panhandle, but which had never been reported in archeological 
              journals. To our surprise, we learned that Jack Hughes had excavated 
              a picket-post house in Gray County, Texas, in 1960, a scant forty 
              miles south of Hank's house. This site, known as <strong>Cantonment 
              Creek</strong>, produced a structure that closely resembled both 
              the Jack Allen house and the structure at Hank's site, and Hughes 
              had even described it in his notes as belonging to Washita River&#8212;i.e., 
              Oklahoma. Hughes didn't publish his Cantonment research, and our 
              team had never heard of it before.</p>
            <p class="text">We also took a closer look at the work Jack's son, 
              Dr. David Hughes, had done at the &quot;Courson Ruins&quot; within 
              the Buried City along Wolf Creek in Ochiltree County. As described 
              in detail in the <a href="../buriedcity/index.html" class="text">Buried 
              City</a> exhibit, the Wolf Creek ruins were best known for their 
              large houses with thick walls made of caliche stone cobbles and 
              adobe. Most of the structures in the Buried City complex dated between 
              1250 and 1450 A.D., and were thus contemporaneous with the structures 
              of Antelope Creek. But in 1985 David Hughes began a four-year excavation 
              of the complex, and we were interested that he found some evidence 
              of picket-post construction.</p>
            <div class="timelinetext"> 
              <p>At Courson A (41OC26), the main house was a small square house 
                with two central support posts flanking the firepit. The house 
                was identifiable because it had burned and the butts of the posts 
                were preserved. The structure is four meters on each side.... Walls 
                were made of shallowly set wood posts from 4 to 12 centimeters 
                in diameter placed up to 25 cm apart. Two main posts flanked the 
                hearth and were set about halfway between the hearth and the northwest 
                and southeast walls.... A radiocarbon date of.... A.D. 1210 (DIC-3281) 
                was obtained on charcoal from a nearby feature.</p>

                Projects: 1986, 1987, and 1988 Seasons,&quot; courtesy David Hughes).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Our research was suggesting that the appearance of 
              picket-post houses in the Texas Panhandle might be more than an 
              anomaly. We now had evidence of five picket-post structures in the 
              Panhandle: Cantonment Creek, Jack Allen, Footprint, Courson A, and 
              Hank's site. The Oklahoma Hypothesis was looking better all the 
              time-an orderly march of picket-post houses that began in central 
              Oklahoma and led all the way to Antelope Creek. If we could get 
              all the dates to line up, we might be able to make a case for a 
              steady migration of people and ideas from Oklahoma to Antelope Creek.</p>
            <h3>New Directions</h3>
            <p class="text">The interpretation of (radio)carbon dates is a tricky 
              science, even for professional archeologists who deal with them 
              all the time. Because a single date can sometimes be misleading 
              and since the early date on Hank's House was so important to our 
              overall interpretation and analysis, we decided to run some more 
              radiocarbon dates to double-check our original date. In archeological 
              jargon, we recognized that the original date of around A.D. 1100 
              might reflect the &quot;old wood problem&quot; in which the dated 
              sample of old tree wood does not reflect the cultural event being 
              dated (see <a href="../hank1/archeology.html#dating" class="text">dating 
              discussion</a> in Hank 1.) </p>
            <p class="text">The other two samples from Hank's house were carefully 
              selected to avoid this problem. The new samples&#8212;one from the 
              outer rings of a charred interior post and the other a corn fragment 
              removed from the floor of Hank's house&#8212;were submitted for 
              dating. The date on the post represents the time when the large 
              juniper tree was cut, which most likely occurred within a year or 
              two of the building of Hank's house. The corn was almost certainly 
              grown by the inhabitants, and the date on this sample reflects the 
              time the cob was harvested. These two dates came back virtually 
              identical. The results disputed the earlier finding and gave us 
              a later date of for the building and occupation of Hank's house, 
              at approximately A.D. 1300, give or take 50 years. The team agreed 
              that this was a reliable age estimate for when Hank's house was 
              built and occupied.</p>
            <p class="text">Suddenly we were faced with a different interpretation 
              of Hank's house based on the new dates. Before, we had assumed that 
              our structure pre-dated the stone structures at Antelope Creek, 
              and might represent a transitional stage of development between 
              Woodland and Plains Village architecture. Now, we found ourselves 
              staring at a scenario we had never considered: the people who built 
              Hank's House were mainstream Plains Villagers, yet didn't belong 
              to Antelope Creek, Buried City, or Custer-Washita River. It appeared 
              that they represented an independent manifestation of Plains Village 
              culture that flourished at the same time.</p>
            <p class="text">The Oklahoma hypothesis wasn't exactly dead, but the 
              new date on Hank's House had certainly altered the orderly progression 
              of dated picket-post structures we had been looking for. </p>
            <p class="text">In archeology, one tries to match new discoveries 
              with previously documented site information, in an attempt to posit 
              relationships and cultural patterns. These relationships can be 
              established through similarities in the artifact assemblages, pottery 
              types, dates of occupation, analysis of human skeletal remains, 
              and architecture. We had done a thorough search of the literature 
              from Antelope Creek, Buried City, Custer-Turkey Creek, and Paoli-Washita, 
              and had found similarities between all of them and Hank's site, 
              but also important differences. Hank's house didn't seem to fit 
              anything we found in the literature of the region.</p>
            <p class="text">But then we took a closer look at the literature itself 
              and realized that archeological research in our region had concentrated 
              on three areas of heavy site density: the four Texas counties centered 
              around Lake Meredith and the Alibates flint quarries (i.e., the 
              core area of Antelope Creek), along Wolf Creek in Ochiltree County 
              (Buried City), and the Custer-Turkey Creek and Paoli-Washita River 
              sites along the Washita River and its tributaries in western and 
              central Oklahoma. Hank's site occupied a &quot;dead zone&quot; where 
              archeologists had seldom ventured, and where few prehistoric sites 
              are documented and virtually none have been excavated. </p>
            <p class="text">The truth was, nobody really knew much about Plains 
              Village sites in Roberts, Hemphill, Lipscomb, Gray, or Collingsworth 
              Counties, and that huge expanse of country represented a major gap 
              in the archeological record. If you were wondering just how big 
              a gap this is, these five Texas Panhandle counties comprise an area 
              of 4,616 square miles, or almost three times larger than the state 
              of Rhode Island.</p>
            <h3>Filling the Gaps</h3>
            <p class="text">The one man who could have helped fill in those gaps 
              had recently died: Dr. Jack Hughes, the dean of Panhandle archeology. 
              As a professor of anthropology and geology at West Texas State University 
              from 1951 to 1985, Jack had passed along his love of archeology 
              to two generations of students, and nobody in the world knew more 
              about archeological sites in the Panhandle. When he wasn't teaching, 
              Jack had driven countless miles across the Panhandle, talking with 
              landowners and collectors, and recording obscure sites for the Panhandle-Plains 
              Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas. If anybody knew what kinds of 
              archeological sites existed in the &quot;dead zone&quot; of the 
              northeastern Panhandle, it would have been Jack Hughes.</p>
            <p class="text">Jack was gone, but he had left behind seven large 
              ring-binder notebooks that contained the meticulous field notes 
              he had recorded between 1952 and 1986. The notes had been indexed 
              and archived at the Panhandle-Plains Museum, and we were given an 
              opportunity to use them in our research. Sure enough, the notes 
              yielded information about many eastern Panhandle sites that Jack 
              had visited and surveyed, only a few of which had ever been excavated 
              and almost none that had ever been written up in the literature. 
              In many instances, his raw field notes provided us with the only 
              information in existence about little-known sites in the eastern 
              Panhandle. </p>
            <p class="text">Our study of the field notes turned up hints and fragments 
              that added to the larger picture we were trying to reconstruct. 
              In his exploration of sites in the eastern Panhandle, Hughes had 
              found surface evidence of Plains Village structures that did not 
              match the pattern of typical Antelope Creek architecture, meaning 
              they had no stone foundations or walls. These structures gave every 
              indication of being either pithouses, houses of picket-post construction, 
              or some combination of the two. In the architecture and pottery, 
              Hughes detected a cultural influence coming from the east or north, 
              or both.</p>
            <p class="text">He found this evidence, not in one or two locations, 
              but in many: in Roberts, Hemphill, Hutchinson, Lipscomb, Gray, and 
              Collingsworth Counties. The sites were on McClellan Creek, Salt 
              Fork of the Red River, Red Deer Creek, Palo Duro Creek, and Wolf 
              Creek. All these locations fell within our &quot;dead zone&quot; 
              in the eastern Panhandle.</p>
            <p class="text">Jack Hughes's field notes left a clear impression 
              that he was tracking a non-Antelope Creek influence on archeology 
              in the eastern Panhandle. Even though his Lake Creek article (1962) 
              had laid out his case for the indigenous development of Antelope 
              Creek people out of Woodland roots, Jack continued to look toward 
              Upper Republican and Washita River for influences on Panhandle archeology, 
              particularly in the eastern Panhandle.</p>
            <p class="text">In his 1968 doctoral dissertation (Prehistory of the 
              Caddoan-Speaking Tribes, Columbia University), Jack Hughes had argued 
              rather strongly that the &quot;Panhandle Aspect,&quot; as the Antelope 
              Creek focus was called at the time, was closely related to Upper 
              Republican groups. He spoke of Panhandle Aspect as &quot;a southern 
              relative of Upper Republican,&quot; &quot;their closest relatives,&quot; 
              and &quot;its southern twin.&quot; He also noted that &quot;in the 
              eastern Panhandle are sites which lack slab structures and have 
              both cord-paddled pottery like the Panhandle aspect and plain ware 
              like the Washita River, Custer, and Henrietta foci to the east.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">Jack Hughes was a man of such enormous curiosity that 
              he needed two or three lifetimes to organize and document his thoughts. 
              If he'd had another lifetime, one suspects that he would have proposed 
              a hypothesis similar to the one we were groping toward with Hank's 
              house: that there was much more to Panhandle archeology than Antelope 
              Creek.</p>
            <h3>Odessa Yates</h3>
            <p class="text">It happened that the Hank's site archeologists weren't 
              the only ones who were finding gaps in the archeological record. 
              Up on Clear Creek in the Oklahoma Panhandle, only sixty miles north 
              of Hank's Site, University of Oklahoma archeologist Scott Brosowske 
              was directing excavations at a site called Odessa Yates while we 
              were working on Hank's site. The Odessa Yates site produced artifacts 
              and carbon dates that suggested a typical Plains Village occupation. 
              These people lived in villages, made pottery, hunted bison with 
              side-notched points, and cultivated crops in the fertile Spur soils 
              along waterways. Brosowske expanded his survey beyond the initial 
              Odessa Yates location and found that the same people had occupied 
              village sites over a wide area on Clear Creek and Kiowa Creek, suggesting 
              a robust economy based on farming and trading.</p>
            <p><span class="text">Up to this point, we might be describing Antelope 
              Creek, Buried City, Washita River, or Upper Republican, but then 
              comes the clinker. The houses Brosowske was excavating at Odessa 
              Yates weren't the stone-slab structures of Antelope Creek, the caliche 
              boulder structures of Buried City, or the rectangular picket-post 
              houses of Washita River, Zimms, and Upper Republican. The Plains 
              Village people at Odessa Yates were living in small circular to 
              oval pithouses with two central roof support posts, and these structures showed evidence of vertical wall posts!</span> </p>
            <p class="text">Jack Hughes's field notes had clearly suggested that 
              pithouse and picket-post construction might be far more common in 
              the eastern Panhandle than anyone had ever dreamed. Our team had 
              documented five picket-post structures in the eastern Texas Panhandle, 
              and now Brosowske had found a group at Odessa Yates that lived in 
              circular pithouses in the Oklahoma Panhandle. </p>
            <p class="text">We were also interested in two other sites in Oklahoma: 
              the Lonker and Stamper sites. Located some forty miles northeast 
              of Odessa Yates, an excavated structure at the Lonker site revealed 
              the remnants of 13 vertical posts and no evidence of stone foundations, 
              and yielded a date very close to our Hank's house, A.D. 1257-1293. 
              In a 1994 article, Robert L. Brooks noted that &quot;the post mold 
              pattern for the structure&#133;resembles patterns occurring at Plains 
              Village sites farther east&quot; (Washita and Zimms) and that the 
              Lonker structure lacked &quot;the central channel common in Antelope 
              Creek houses.&quot; We found it particularly interesting that Brooks 
              was not able to assign the Lonker site to any of the known Plains 
              Village affiliations. Indeed, he noted that of 52 Plains Village 
              sites in Beaver and Texas Counties in the Oklahoma Panhandle, 30 
              &quot;represent sites of unknown Plains Village affiliation.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p class="text">In 2003, Christopher Lintz began publishing a series 
              of articles to reevaluate the Stamper site in Texas County of the 
              Oklahoma Panhandle. Excavations at this important Plains Village 
              site were done in 1933 and 1934 by Federal Emergency Relief Administration 
              archeologists C. Stewart Johnson and Fred Carder. Some information 
              was published on this work in 1950, but it was far from a full analysis 
              and the site data had not been looked at since. Lintz reexamined 
              the site data, and in 2003 he published the first three articles 
              of a four-part series on the Stamper site in  Oklahoma Archeology: 
              Journal of the Oklahoma Anthropological Society (Volume 51, Numbers 
              2, 3, and 4; the fourth article will appear in 2004). While many 
              pithouses were excavated and most had rock-lined wall foundations, 
              yet another house with vertical post walls had been dug by Fred 
              Carder in 1934. In the manuscript for part 4, Lintz presents new 
              evidence and interpretations, and describes Structure 14B as:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="text"><em>a large, rectangular room with a central channel 
                that is comprised of 22 features&#133;. The features making up this 
                structure consist of 17 postholes, of which 11 are along walls 
                and six are on the inside; a floor plastered with adobe; two lateral 
                walls forming the extended entrance; one entry step; and one of 
                the two adobe plaster walls lining a central channel. This structure 
                is the only building that is recorded by a map in Carder's field 
                journal. </em> </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text">All this evidence of non-stone architecture was coming 
              out of occupation zones that were clearly identified as Plains Village 
              and provided proof that pithouse and picket-post construction had 
              survived into the Plains Village period of 1250 to 1450 A.D. This 
              seemed a major departure from accepted models, and we were left 
              wondering, <strong>Who were these people?</strong></p>
            <p class="text">It appeared that in the eastern portions of the Texas 
              and Oklahoma Panhandles we were finding groups of Plains Village 
              people who followed lifeways similar to the major groups, but who 
              had developed their own unique cultural patterns. All of this new 
              data was coming from a region that would have been classified just 
              a few years ago, without much thought, as being within the Antelope 
              Creek culture area. This ill-defined area may have extended as far 
              south as the Red River in the Texas Panhandle, and as far north 
              as southwestern Kansas; westward to the fringes of the Antelope 
              Creek habitation zone in the central Texas Panhandle, and eastward 
              into the Washita River area of Oklahoma. It might include the quirky 
              little outcroppings of culture at Buried City, the Zimms complex, 
              Odessa Yates, Stamper, Lonker, and, perhaps, the people who built 
              picket-post houses at Jack Allen, Cantonment Creek, and Hank's site. 
              (However, the picket post house at Footprint, squarely in the middle 
              of Antelope Creek core area in the central Panhandle, still doesn't 
              make sense!)</p>
            <H3>Conclusion</H3
>
            <p class="text">Those of us who dabble in archeology yearn for simple 
              answers and tidy theories that will explain what we find in the 
              field. Our team at Hank's house has found neither, but rather far 
              more diversity and complexity than we ever expected. It has even 
              gotten to the point that we have dubbed the term &quot;typical West 
              Pasture&quot; to refer to anything we find that doesn't fit our 
              expectations or the widely accepted archeological models. Typical 
              West Pasture is now a seemingly endless stream of head-scratching 
              finds that provoke more questions than answers. The continuing work 
              we're doing at sites in West Pasture promises to muddle the picture 
              even more, at least for the short term. Getting back to our original 
              question of where the architectural influences came from, we haven't 
              proved &quot;The Oklahoma Hypothesis,&quot; but our research has 
              revealed a substantial eastern or northern influence in the archeology 
              of the eastern Texas Panhandle, an influence that Jack Hughes detected 
              forty years ago but which has been left for others to document.</p>
            <p class="text">Did the influence come from Washita River people to 
              the east, or from Upper Republican migrations from the north? Was 
              there any mingling with Apishapa stone masons from Colorado? Did 
              the people who built Hank's house have any role in the development 
              of the Antelope Creek villages in the central Panhandle? And, were 
              the villages in West Pasture peaceful, or were they too plagued 
              by warfare as so many of their neighbors were?</p>
            <p class="text">The mysteries we've exposed through our work at Hank's 
              site may never be resolved completely, but our best hope lies in 
              further excavation and analysis of sites in the eastern Texas Panhandle, 
              northwestern Oklahoma, and southwestern Kansas. Until that work 
              is done, we can make very few statements with confidence, but of 
              one thing we are sure: there is much more to Panhandle archeology 
              than Antelope Creek.</p>

                    a recessed area in the wall, and it is thought to have been 
                    a prominent location where a shrine was constructed or other 
                    significant items were kept. No altar was present in Hank&#8217;s 
                    house. Photo courtesy Chris Lintz.</div>

                    deep pit (the post holes and edge of the house are highlighted).

                    Structure B at the Two Sisters site in Texas County in the 
                    Oklahoma Panhandle. Excavated in 1972-1973, the site had several 
                    structures with foundations of vertical rocks. Structure B 
                    is unusual in that its floor plan is similar to that of a 
                    &#8220;Type 1&#8221; house, but it had no vertical rocks and 
                    no evidence of posts was found. This house had also burned, 
                    but no evidence of burned posts or postholes was found! Were 
                    the postholes simply missed or had the posts been removed? 
                    Because so few artifacts were found in the house, Oklahoma 
                    archeologist Marjorie Duncan thinks Structure B was intentionally 
                    burned. Sketch map adapted from Duncan's dissertation.</div>
