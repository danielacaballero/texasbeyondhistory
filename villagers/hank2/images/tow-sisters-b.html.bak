      house is Structure B at the Two Sisters site in Texas County in the Oklahoma 
      Panhandle. Excavated in 1972-1973, the site had several structures with 
      foundations of vertical rocks. Structure B is unusual in that its floor 
      plan is similar to that of a &#8220;Type 1&#8221; house, but it had no vertical 
      rocks and no evidence of posts was found. This house had also burned, but 
      no evidence of burned posts or postholes was found! Were the postholes simply 
      missed or had the posts been removed? Because so few artifacts were found 
      in the house, Oklahoma archeologist Marjorie Duncan thinks Structure B was 
      intentionally burned. Sketch map adapted from Duncan's dissertation. <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
