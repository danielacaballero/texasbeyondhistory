                            the turn of the century and is based on interviews of 
                            tribal elders and close examination of &quot;modern&quot; Hidatsa earth lodges. The Hidatsa speak a Siouan language 
                            and are closely related to the Crow Indians. They lived 
                            in the Northern Plains where winter conditions demanded 
                            a more substantial shelter than that needed in the Southern 
                            Plains. Still, the basic techniques were shared by many 
                            Plains groups speaking Siouan and Caddoan languages.</p>

                  <p class="text">During the excavations, we spent a lot of time 
                    pondering the question, &quot;How was Hank's house built?&quot; 
                    We were able to figure out some things while we were digging, 
                    like the pattern of the posts along the walls, but other facts 
                    remained elusive until long after the excavation was over. 
                    It was not until the analysis phase that many of the important 
                    details, such as what types of trees and grass used in construction, 
                    became known. When all of the archeological data are considered 
                    together, we can reconstruct the story of how Hank's house 
                    was built with a fair degree of accuracy. While we cannot 
                    be sure of the exact sequence of events, the overall picture 
                    of what had to be done to build such a house is clear. </p>
                  <p class="text">The story of building Hank's house, a sort of 
                    &quot;construction reconstruction,&quot; is based on four 
                    types of data: (1) the archeological details; (2) information 
                    learned from other archeological investigations of similar 
                    houses; (3) construction techniques learned by archeologists 
                    making full-sized or scale model reconstructions of ancient 
                    houses; and (4) ethnohistoric accounts of how other peoples 
                    built similar types of houses. </p>
                  <p class="text">One written account of how the Hidatsa Indians 
                    who lived in the Northern Plains (South Dakota area) built 
                    their houses was particularly informative. From 1906 to 1918, 
                    Gilbert L. Wilson observed how the Hidatsa constructed earth 
                    lodges at the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and he interviewed 
                    elders who remembered what life was like before the reservation. 
                    This information was published in 1934 in a study called &quot;The 
                    Hidatsa Earthlodge.&quot; Although the Hidatsa earth lodges 
                    were basically surface houses (with only a foot or so of fill 
                    removed) that were round and much larger than the pithouse 
                    at Hank's site, there are many similarities and Hank's house 
                    was undoubtedly built using many of the same techniques. Illustrations 
                    from Wilson's study accompany this section.</p>
                  <p class="text">The first step in building a pithouse like Hank's 
                    began long before the actual house construction. The juniper 
                    trees to be used in building the house were probably selected, 
                    cut down, and trimmed to form posts many months, perhaps a 
                    year or more, before the house was to be built so the posts 
                    would be cured (completely dried). To build a pithouse like 
                    Hank's, you would need to cut, trim, and cure the following 
                    posts:</p>

                    to start construction, many people were needed to help and 
                    someone had to be in charge of the entire operation. In modern 
                    terms, this person functioned as the general contractor to 
                    oversee all phases of the house building and direct the work. 
                    Among the Hidatsa, lodge building was a community effort, 
                    and a respected elder woman was put in charge. The family 
                    who would live in the lodge was expected to throw a feast 
                    for everyone when the house building was completed (the same 
                    practice was followed by the Caddo, the Wichita and other 
                    Caddoan groups). But before you could feast, you had to build 
                    the house. The steps in the construction process are outlined 
                    below:</p></td>

            <h3>(1) Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Select the house location.</li>
              <li>Gather all of the juniper posts that were previously dried and 
                cured at the construction site.</li>
              <li>Cut and gather hundreds of small branches, 0.5 to 1 inch diameter 
                and various lengths, for the roof.</li>
              <li>Cut and gather hundreds of bundles of yellow Indian grass for 
                use in the roof. </li>
              <li>Gather lots of rope&#8212;strips of buffalo hide, tree bark, 
                or twisted plant fibers&#8212;for use in lashing poles together.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>(2) Prepare Foundation and Construct Frame</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Dig a rectangular pit the size of the house about 3 feet deep, 
                piling the dirt around the edges.</li>
              <li>Dig the deep holes for the four central posts (the main roof 
                support posts).</li>
              <li>Set the four central posts into the holes and pack soil around 
                them until they are firmly planted.</li>
              <li>Set the framework of four horizontal stringer beams that rest 
                on top of the four central posts. (The Hidatsa considered the 
                four central posts and beam frame on top to be sacred.)</li>
              <li>Dig the post holes for all of the wall posts around the edges 
                of the pit.</li>
              <li>Set all of the wall posts firmly in place.</li>
              <li>Set the framework of horizontal stringers that form the top 
                of the walls.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>(3) Construct Roof</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Set roof rafters, each one extending from a wall stringer to 
                a central stringer. </li>
              <li>Construct a small framework to form a smoke hole at the top 
                of the roof.</li>
              <li>Set small branches (juniper, elm, and other woods) perpendicular 
                to the rafters to form a solid single layer.</li>
              <li>Add a layer of yellow Indian grass, 2 to 4 inches thick, by 
                lashing closely spaced bundles atop the small branches. The grass 
                runs perpendicular to the small branches and parallel to the rafters.</li>
              <li>Add layer of sod (topsoil layer held together by roots), probably 
                4 to 6 inches thick, on top of the bundled-grass layer.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>(4) Construct Entrance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Dig the ramped entryway.</li>
              <li>Dig and set vertical posts and horizontal stringers to form 
                the entryway frame.</li>
              <li>Set vertical slats to form entryway walls.</li>
              <li>Add clay plaster to the entrance ramp and entryway step.</li>
              <li>Add clay plaster to lower interior walls.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>(5) Finish Interior</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Dig out a few inches of soil from rectangular area to create 
                the central channel.</li>
              <li>Dig the central fire hearth and line it with moist clay.</li>
              <li>Add clay plaster along the edge of the channel to strengthen 
                the channel lip.</li>
              <li>Add clay plaster to the interior ceiling around the smoke hole 
                for fire safety.</li>
            </ul>
