      <h2>What is Flotation?</h2>
      <p> Flotation is a recovery technique that archeologists and specialists 
        use to separate out different types of materials from sediment or &quot;matrix&quot; 
        samples. Basically, the sediment is poured into a frothy liquid (usually 
        water) and some things float while others sink. The &quot;light fraction,&quot; 
        those things that are light enough to float (like charcoal and seeds), 
        is skimmed off the top and set aside. The &quot;heavy fraction,&quot; 
        the stuff that falls to the bottom of the liquid, is put through a series 
        of wire-mesh screens of different grades (fine, coarse, etc.) to sort 
        the heavy stuff (stones, bone, potsherds, etc.) into size fractions. The 
        various fractions (light fraction and several size fractions of the heavy 
        stuff) are sorted using tweezers, good lighting, magnification (sometimes 
        even under a microscope), and lots of patience. For most people, this 
        is mind-numbing work, but amid the bits and pieces, some very informative 
        things are found. </p>
      <p>Two categories in particular have proven very useful to archeologists: 
        macrobotanical remains and microfauna. Macrobotanical remains (and some 
        microscopic ones) are small particles of charred (and sometimes uncharred) 
        plants like seeds and pieces of wood that can usually be seen by the naked 
        eye. Specialists known as paleobotanists study these tiny plant bits and 
        compare the archeological samples with modern comparative samples they 
        have collected and prepared.<br>
