      Jones excavated Pits 1 and 2 located about 15 m away from Hank's house. 
      The arrow points to Pit 1, the more obvious in this photo. These two pits 
      were exposed in the creek cutbank and about half of each remained. Both 
      were classic &quot;bell-shaped&quot; storage pits, and excavation revealed 
      that Pit 1 was clean and probably still functioned as a storage pit when 
      it was last used. In contrast, after Pit 2 was last used as a storage pit, 
      it was backfilled with trash. These pits are probably associated with another 
      house that may still be buried nearby. Photo by Doug Boyd.<br>
