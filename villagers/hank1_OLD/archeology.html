                  <p class="text">The prospect of investigating Hank's house was 
                    exciting because its well-preserved remains offered an opportunity 
                    to learn a great deal about the architecture of a Plains Village 
                    pithouse. We wanted to &quot;salvage&quot; the information 
                    before the next big flood completed the erosional process 
                    and washed away the remaining half of the house. Such floods 
                    are highly unpredictable&#151;it might be 20 years or 24 hours 
                    before a real Panhandle gully washer stalled over the upper 
                    end of the West Pasture and remodeled the landscape, sending 
                    Hank's house tumbling down the streambed. So we decided to 
                    conduct a salvage excavation as soon as possible. But first 
                    we had to find a crew and solve some logistical problems, 
                    the heaviest of which (literally) was removing the thick mantle 
                    of up to two meters (seven feet) of sand covering the pithouse. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Finding a willing crew proved easy enough once 
                    Doug Wilkens and Doug Boyd spread the word of what we had found. The 
                    Panhandle has a small, but active group of experienced avocational 
                    archeologists, most of whom are members of the Panhandle Archeological 
                    Society and the Texas Archeological Society. We also persuaded 
                    several professional archeologists active in Southern Plains 
                    archeology to take time &quot;off&quot; and join us. Meanwhile, 
                    Erickson took care of the logistics including establishing 
                    a field camp at the site where we could store equipment and 
                    preparing an excavation platform along the creek cutbank.</p>
                  <p class="text">We returned to the M-Cross Ranch in late November, 
                    2000, with a sizable contingent of volunteers. Before most 
                    arrived, landowner John Erickson used his small bulldozer and Bobcat to remove 
                    the overburden (overlying sand), stopping a foot and a half 
                    (40-50 centimeters) or so above the pithouse layer. Over the 
                    next week, the volunteer crew put in 406 hours of labor as 
                    we exposed most of the remaining half of the pithouse and 
                    several of the associated features. We had hoped to finish 
                    the dig in one session, but couldn't quite do it. In mid-May, 
                    2001, we returned with a smaller crew for a three-day dig 
                    to wrap things up. The rest of this section explains what 
                    we found.</p>
                  <h3><a name="half"></a>Sliced in Half </h3>
                  <p class="text">Hank's site is formally known as 41RB109, being 
                    the 109th officially recorded site in Roberts County, Texas. 
                    The unnamed creek through the West Pasture had, in essence, 
                    given us the kind of view that archeologists often like to 
                    start with&#151;a long cross-section or slice through Hank's 
                    site. The map on the left shows the area we excavated and 
                    the archeological features we identified along this slice. 
                    Before discussing the prehistoric house proper, let's look 
                    at some of the other features we found outside the house. 
                    Some of these were very close to Hank's house and very likely 
                    &quot;functionally associated,&quot; meaning they were probably 
                    created and used by the occupants of the house. But others 
                    are farther away and were probably part of another household&#151;without 
                    additional excavation we can't really tell.</p>
                  <p class="text">Hank's house faces east, like many Plains Village 
                    houses, and has an extended entranceway (see house diagram 
                    on right). We excavated around the front of the house and 
                    found several noteworthy features. In front of Hank's house 
                    was a<strong> trash midden, </strong> a thin sheet-like layer of household 
                    trash &#8212;scattered bits of artifacts, such as flint flakes 
                    and pottery sherds, mixed with dark, charcoal-stained soil. 
                    Within the midden were three distinct groups of objects (archeologists 
                    call such groupings cultural features), all of which indicate 
                    that the area in front of the house&#151;a sort of &quot;front 
                    porch&quot;&#151;was used not only for discarding trash, but 
                    also served as a storage area and probably a work area. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Caliche Cobble Cluster:</strong> The first feature 
                    was a cluster of unmodified caliche rocks that were probably 
                    collected and piled with the intent of being used at a later 
                    time. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Mussel Shell Cluster:</strong> The second was 
                    a tightly packed cluster of six complete mussel shell valves 
                    that had been stacked, one inside the other. These, too, appeared 
                    to represent materials that were stockpiled for later use. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Grinding Stone Tool Cache:</strong> The third 
                    feature within the trash midden was a tool cache of eight 
                    rocks, seven of which were grinding tools. A &quot;cache&quot; 
                    is a group of objects that were intentionally stored, perhaps 
                    even hidden. A metate, a pestle, and five different sizes 
                    and types of manos were found in a tight cluster and appeared 
                    to have been stored in a small pit. These grinding implements 
                    made up a diversified tool kit useful for a variety of different 
                    functions. The eighth rock was a large chunk of very grainy 
                    and poorly consolidated conglomerate. The large rounded sand 
                    grains that comprise this rock look very similar to the grains 
                    seen in many of the potsherds found on the site. Pieces of 
                    this rock may have been crushed up and added as a tempering 
                    agent to the clay used for making pottery. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Storage Pits</strong>: On the edge (as we perceived 
                    it) of the sheet midden was the <strong>bell-shaped pit</strong> (Pit 
                    3) found just outside the entrance to Hank's house. We found 
                    two other bell-shaped pits 12 to 15 meters east of Hank's 
                    house. Like Hank's house, all three of these pit features 
                    had been sliced in half by erosion. The bell shape of the 
                    pits is typical of underground pits used by many different 
                    prehistoric and historic Indian groups across much of the 
                    Great Plains, and they were typically used by farming peoples 
                    for storing crops that were harvested in the fall for use 
                    later in the winter. The relatively narrow entrance at the 
                    top of the pit was necessary so that the opening could be 
                    easily covered by a large flat rock, a flat piece of wood, 
                    or perhaps a smoked buffalo hide cover held down by rocks 
                    and covered by dirt. The covered pit would have been hidden 
                    and protected from most varmints (at least until some lucky 
                    rat dug his way into it). </p>
                  <p class="text">Because <strong>Pit 3</strong> was located just past the 
                    entryway to Hank's house, it likely served as an underground 
                    storage bin for the people who lived in the house. The pit 
                    could have been used for many years but probably was abandoned 
                    when some food rotted inside it or burrowing rodents dug into 
                    it. Once the pit became useless for food storage, the people 
                    living in the house probably filled it with household trash, 
                    bits and pieces of which we found.</p>
                  <p class="text">Because Pits 1 and 2 were located some distance 
                    from Hank's house, they were probably not associated with 
                    Hank's house and may have been used by people who lived in 
                    another residential structure nearby. Like Pit 3, Pit 2 was 
                    filled with cultural debris (trash) and had been converted 
                    from a storage pit to a trash pit. In contrast, the fill inside 
                    Pit 1 contained no cultural debris, the sediment fill inside 
                    was very clean (there was no charcoal or ashy sediment), and 
                    the pit outline was well defined. This may indicate that the 
                    last function of the pit was for storage of perishable foods. 
                    An attempt was made to identify any organic remains that might 
                    have been stored in this pit, but none were preserved.</p>
                  <h3><a name="arch"></a>Architecture of Hank's House </h3>
                  <p class="text">In this section, we take a closer look at what 
                    we found in the pithouse and what we think it means. Excavation 
                    is a process of discovering evidence, but detailed and accurate 
                    records must be kept so that you can study and interpret that 
                    evidence after it is dug up. Each layer of fill in Hank's 
                    house was carefully excavated and all artifacts and features 
                    were plotted on excavation maps. Descriptions of the excavations 
                    and features were written, and hundreds of forms and maps 
                    were created. Thousands of photographs (black and white, color 
                    slides, and digital images) were taken to document every detail 
                    the archeologists saw. All of the artifacts were collected 
                    in bags marked with precise location information (provenience), 
                    and many charcoal and soil samples were taken. All of these 
                    steps are time consuming but important because what remained 
                    of Hank's house was destroyed in the act of excavating it. 
                    A site cannot be reconstructed to reveal the stories of life 
                    long ago unless such detailed records are kept and studied. 
                    The process is similar to how forensic scientists investigate 
                    a crime scene to learn exactly what happened.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the excavation, we separated the sediment 
                    inside the house into three stratigraphic layers called the 
                    upper fill zone, middle fill zone, and floor zone. The <strong>upper 
                    fill zone</strong> represents sediment and artifacts that were 
                    deposited inside the depression created after the house was 
                    abandoned and collapsed. The sediment was mainly eolian sands 
                    that were blown in by the wind, and the artifacts were probably 
                    thrown into the shallow depression by prehistoric people. 
                    We suspect that the depression filled in quickly, probably 
                    within a few years of when the house fell down.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>middle fill zone</strong> was marked by the 
                    appearance of charcoal staining and small fragments of burned 
                    clay daub, and these burned materials became larger and denser 
                    throughout this zone. Large intact pieces of charred wood 
                    and burned daub found in this zone clearly indicated the house 
                    had burned. These materials were especially abundant in the 
                    western portion of the house, where the burning was quite 
                    intensive, but sparse in the east side and southeastern corner. 
                    It soon became clear that the debris represented the materials 
                    from the roof of the house that had burned and collapsed. 
                    Some of the burned wood represented long segments of tree 
                    branches, while many of the burned daub fragments had parallel 
                    stick impressions indicating that wet clay had been pressed 
                    onto the inside of the roof. The burned daub was most abundant 
                    in the center of the house, indicating that lots of clay was 
                    used to line the smoke hole above the central fire pit. The 
                    people who lived in Hank's house must have been concerned 
                    about the possibility of sparks from the fire pit rising and 
                    igniting the roof.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>floor zone</strong> represents materials found 
                    in the last 4 to 6 inches above the floor of the house. This 
                    zone contained abundant charred wood and burned daub, mainly 
                    in the western area, and some artifacts. Where the burning 
                    was intensive, the floor itself was a thin layer of baked 
                    clay sediment, and the excavators could easily follow the 
                    floor. In this area, small hollow tubes of charred grass found 
                    lying directly on the floor had once been part of the roof. 
                    In the eastern part of the house where little or no evidence 
                    of burning was observed, the floor was difficult to follow. 
                    The unburned clay on the floor had gradually melted away (dissolved) 
                    as water percolated down through the sandy sediments over 
                    many hundreds of years. </p>
                  <p class="text">When the excavations ended, we had exposed exactly 
                    one half of the original pithouse and the house layout was 
                    obvious and familiar. Hank's house was similar in many ways 
                    to other pithouses found and excavated in the Texas Panhandle, 
                    but it also was unique in many respects. The burning of the 
                    structure preserved many important architectural details. 
                    Some are typical of prehistoric pithouses of the Antelope 
                    Creek and Buried City cultures, others are not. Each of the 
                    key architectural features of Hank's house is described below.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Clay-plastered Entryway:</strong> Hank's house 
                    had a nine-foot-long entryway that was plastered with clay. 
                    It began about three feet inside the east wall of the house 
                    and extended eastward six feet beyond the east wall. It was 
                    essentially a paved ramp that sloped from the original ground 
                    surface at its east end down into the house, and the walls 
                    of the entrance extended into the house at least two feet. 
                    The ramp bottomed out just inside the house, but rose sharply 
                    on its west end forming a hump or step that was several inches 
                    higher than the floor or the lower edge of the entry ramp. 
                    This was obviously a high-traffic area, and multiple layers 
                    of clay indicated that the step had been replastered several 
                    times. It also formed a depression in the entryway where the 
                    bottom of the ramp met the step. Fine, laminated layers of 
                    sediment in this depression suggest that it was a water trap 
                    that prevented water from running into the house during heavy 
                    rains.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>West Wall:</strong> The west wall of the house 
                    was the best-preserved architectural feature because it had 
                    been intensively burned. Along the west wall, eight wooden 
                    posts had been completely charred and clay wall plaster between 
                    them was burned and still in place. Below the floor level 
                    there were six post holes, round to oval in shape, found beneath 
                    charred posts. The two burned posts that did not have corresponding 
                    postholes were resting directly on the floor and had not been 
                    set into the ground. The posts ranged in size from 3 to 4 
                    inches (7 to 11 cm) in diameter, and from 8 to 16 inches (20 
                    to 40 cm) in depth below the floor. In cross-section, some 
                    charred posts were round and had been complete logs or branches, 
                    while others were arc-shaped (half branches) or thin slats 
                    that represent split branches. It is quite possible that wood 
                    was scarce enough that the builders split some branches to 
                    conserve their lumber. The west wall plaster and charred posts 
                    were preserved to a height of about 2 feet above the house 
                    floor. Most of the posts were burned down only to the floor 
                    level, where the fire probably stopped due to lack of oxygen, 
                    but a few posts were charred down below the floor level and 
                    deep into the postholes. Such burning is not common, but modern 
                    ranchers have seen wooden fence posts burn down deep into 
                    the ground in some cases. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>South wall:</strong> Eight post holes were found 
                    along the south wall, but only one remnant of a charred post. 
                    The post closest to the southwest corner of the house had 
                    been burned in place, but only a small portion of it was found 
                    above the floor level. It appears that the intensity of the 
                    fire was greatest in this corner, but the burned debris found 
                    on the floor diminished toward the east. Three large flat 
                    chunks of burned clay were found along the south wall near 
                    the southwest corner of the house. These appear to have been 
                    remnants of clay plaster from the wall, and two of the pieces 
                    appeared to be in place along the south wall. The post holes 
                    along the south wall ranged from 7.5 to 17 inches (9 cm to 
                    43 cm) deep below the floor level. Based on the diameters 
                    of these postholes, the posts were probably about the same 
                    sizes as those on the west wall&#8212;about 3 to 4 inches 
                    (7 to 11 cm) in diameter.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>East wall:</strong> The east wall was marked by 
                    five post holes but no charred posts were found. Remnants 
                    of wall plaster were found adjacent to and near the entryway 
                    step. The absence of burned posts and scarcity of burned wall 
                    plaster indicates that the fire was not very intense toward 
                    the front of the house. The east wall post holes ranged from 
                    7 to 12 inches (18 to 31 cm) deep below the floor level. These 
                    posts were probably about the same sizes as those along the 
                    west wall.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>SW Central Post:</strong> This was a very large 
                    post, set deeply in the ground. This post was very obvious 
                    to the excavators because a large chunk of a burned log, measuring 
                    nearly 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter, was preserved and stuck 
                    up several inches above the floor level. This large post had 
                    burned in place, but the burning stopped just below the floor 
                    level. When a deep test was excavated through the floor to 
                    reveal the profile, the post hole was 10 inches (25 cm) wide 
                    at the top and tapered to a point at a depth of about 24 inches 
                    (60 cm) below the floor level. The tip of the post had been 
                    charred before it was set into the ground.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>SE Central Post:</strong> We almost didn't find 
                    this posthole&#151;a fact that serves as a cautionary note 
                    to archeologists digging pithouses like Hank's. As we excavated 
                    Hank's house, it seemed to be following a pattern of interior 
                    features that was similar to that of other pithouses in the 
                    Antelope Creek area. Once the southwest central post was found, 
                    it seemed logical that there must be a corresponding southeast 
                    central post. But when we reached the floor level at this 
                    location, the expected burned post or a posthole wasn't there. 
                    Instead, it seemed to be a continuous floor surface. Some 
                    burned debris was across the floor in this area, and there 
                    were lots of rodent burrows, but there was still no hint of 
                    this post hole as we troweled through the floor. We joked 
                    that it was obvious the Indians must not have read an archeological 
                    report on how their house should have been built. </p>
                  <p class="text">Puzzled, we kept on digging below the floor 
                    with our trowels because we were convinced that there had 
                    to be a southeast central post to support the roof. It was 
                    not until we had dug a full 4 inches below what appeared to 
                    be an intact floor surface that the first hint of a post hole 
                    was seen. At this point, we found a circular stain that measured 
                    about 9 inches (23 cm) in diameter. We then dug a small pit 
                    down below the floor to create a profile and found that the 
                    posthole extended down 20 inches (50 cm) below the floor level. 
                    Like the southwest central post, the tip of the southeast 
                    central post had been charred before it was set into the posthole. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Central Firepit:</strong> In the very center of 
                    Hank's house was the firepit or central hearth. The hearth 
                    was created by digging a large, bowl-shaped pit and lining 
                    it with clay plaster. When viewed from above, the hearth appeared 
                    as a circular pit ringed by a ridge of clay that was about 
                    5 cm higher than the surrounding floor. The outside diameter 
                    of the clay ridge was 20 inches (50 cm), and its inside diameter, 
                    the mouth of the pit, was 18 inches (45 cm). When viewed in 
                    profile, the hearth had a deep bowl shape and tapered to a 
                    rounded bottom that measured about 11 inches (28 cm) in diameter. 
                    The pit was 11.5 inches (29 cm deep).</p>
                  <p class="text">Several layers of fill were evident in the firepit. 
                    The layer of burned debris across the floor of Hank's house 
                    extended down about 4 inches (10 cm) into the hearth pit. 
                    This represented roof fall material from when the house burned. 
                    Below that was a layer of brown clayey sand, 4 to 5.5 inches 
                    (10 to 14 cm) thick, that looked like wind-blown sand. On 
                    the very bottom was a 4- to 5-inch (10 to 13 cm) thick layer 
                    of gray ash, presumably from the last time the hearth was 
                    used. At the top of this ash layer, a single sherd of cordmarked 
                    pottery was found. </p>
                  <p class="text">The clay layers that lined the hearth were interesting. 
                    There was some hint of lamination, suggesting that several 
                    layers of clay might have been added at different times. There 
                    also was an outer layer of clay that was definitely added 
                    at a later time. Several inches of clay had been mounded up 
                    to reform the rim of the hearth, and this added layer extended 
                    about half way down inside the hearth before abruptly ending.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Central Channel:</strong> Hank's house had a distinctive 
                    depressed floor area in its center. If the house were complete, 
                    it would have formed a rectangle with a central roof support 
                    post at each corner. Often called a central channel, the rectangular 
                    area around the hearth was about 4 inches (10 cm) lower than 
                    the surrounding floor. Such depressed floor areas are common 
                    features in many Antelope Creek houses, but its precise function 
                    is not known. Archeologists have speculated that it may have 
                    helped with airflow around the central hearth, and it might 
                    have served as a water trap to keep most of the house dry 
                    if water seeped (or poured) inside during heavy rains. The 
                    central channel also served as the main kitchen and living 
                    room, around which people would do many different activities. 
                    The area around the channel would have been used for storage 
                    of belongings and sleeping areas.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Post Notch:</strong> An arc-shaped notch was found 
                    along the southern channel lip, about half way between the 
                    southwest and southeast central posts. This notch appears 
                    to have been added sometime after the house was initially 
                    built, presumably to accommodate the bottom of a vertical post. 
                    It may mean that the house was used for several years, at 
                    least long enough for the roof to begin sagging and require 
                    an additional support post.</p>
                  <h3><a name="art"></a>Artifacts </h3>
                  <p class="text">The artifacts recovered from Hank's site can 
                    be classified into six groups based on how they were associated 
                    with the house: </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Post-Occupation Fill:</strong> artifacts found 
                    in the upper levels of sediment inside the pithouse. These 
                    materials probably represent trash from occupations of other 
                    houses nearby that was thrown into the pithouse depression 
                    after Hank's house was abandoned.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>House Refuse:</strong> artifacts found in the 
                    sheet midden in front of the entrance to the house. These 
                    materials were probably used and discarded by people who lived 
                    in Hank's house.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>House Storage:</strong> artifacts associated with 
                    the three storage/cache features found in the midden area.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>House:</strong> artifacts found on or near the 
                    floor of Hank's house. These materials represent items used 
                    by the inhabitants of the house.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Pit 3:</strong> artifacts found inside Pit 3. 
                    These materials were probably used and discarded by people 
                    who lived in Hank's House.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Pit 2:</strong> artifacts found inside Pit 2. 
                    These materials were probably used and discarded by people 
                    who lived in a separate house nearby.</p>
                  <p class="text">Several of us involved in the dig along with 
                    some outside specialists are still studying the artifacts 
                    and samples from Hank's site. Proper analysis takes time and 
                    isn't considered complete until a final technical report is 
                    prepared. Since this is a volunteer effort, we work on it 
                    as we can and keep chipping away at it, bit by bit. Some of 
                    the artifacts in the house assemblage are important for understanding 
                    the people who lived in Hank's house and are mentioned here. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The house assemblage is really very small, and 
                    it was obvious which artifacts had been in the house when 
                    it burned. A few flakes of Alibates flint, some turtle bones, 
                    and some fragments of cordmarked pottery were found directly 
                    on the house floor. A Washita arrow point was found in a mass 
                    of burned debris along the west wall. It is also made of Alibates 
                    flint but is permanently discolored due to the intensive heating. 
                    Because its tip was broken off, it seems likely that someone 
                    had brought an arrow home to take off the broken point and 
                    lash on a new one. The broken point was probably discarded 
                    or lost in the house.</p>
                  <p class="text">One feature found on the floor of Hank's house 
                    is a cluster of artifacts found along the south wall. This 
                    group of artifacts consists of two bone tools, a mussel shell 
                    scraper, a rounded caliche pebble, a rounded silicate pebble, 
                    and a flake with a worn edge. All of these tools were found 
                    in a small pile, as if they had been intentionally laid there 
                    or perhaps inside a rawhide bag or small basket (which subsequently 
                    rotted). Although we can't say for sure what these artifacts 
                    represent, my working hypothesis is that they represent a 
                    &quot;potter's tool kit.&quot; Such tool kits were groups 
                    of implements that would have been used to make pottery. </p>
                  <p class="text">The pottery we've found at Hank's site doesn't 
                    match the thin <a href="../cordmarked/index.html" class="text">Borger 
                    cordmarked pottery</a> found in Antelope Creek sites. Most 
                    of it is relatively thick-walled and is tempered with chunks 
                    of scoria, a locally available volcanic rock. Scoria tempering 
                    has not been reported from most Plains Village sites, and 
                    was once regarded as a diagnostic trait of Woodland-period 
                    pottery. We're finding scoria-tempered pottery all over the 
                    West Pasture, and its presence in this area makes perfect 
                    sense because large chunks of scoria are found in the upland 
                    gravels along much of the Canadian River valley in the eastern 
                    Texas Panhandle. </p>
                  <p class="text">The local scoria is a dark red to black, porous-looking 
                    igneous rock full of little air pockets that form tiny holes 
                    along its edges. It is, in fact, a volcanic slag ejected out 
                    of a volcano during an eruption. The most important characteristics 
                    of the local scoria are that the weathered nodules are easy 
                    to crush up, and the tiny bits of rock have sharp angular 
                    edges and make excellent temper for binding clay together 
                    in pottery making.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the West Pasture sites, scoria-tempered cordmarked 
                    pottery is found in contexts that are definitely Plains Village, 
                    such as on the floor of Hank's house and in the trash-filled 
                    storage pit nearby. Jack Hughes reported finding it at a number 
                    of Plains Villager sites in the eastern Panhandle. David Hughes 
                    also noted scoria tempering in some of the ceramics at Buried 
                    City. Thus it appears to be a common pattern in the eastern 
                    Texas Panhandle and a continuation of a more widespread Woodland 
                    pattern. </p>
                  <H3><a name="special"></a>Special Samples </H3>
                  <p class="text">Besides the artifacts recovered from Hank's 
                    site, many samples of charred materials and sediment (from 
                    soil or fill layers) were collected. Sediment samples were 
                    processed using the flotation method to recover charred plant 
                    remains. All of these samples were then examined by Dr. Phil 
                    Dering, then with the Archeobotany Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M 
                    University (Dering now has his own independent lab in Comstock, 
                    Texas). Many of the charred samples were of wood or grass 
                    that was part of the house and are discussed below. Other 
                    charred samples from the floor of the house, the storage pits, 
                    or the trash midden in front of the house represent plant 
                    foods eaten by the people who lived there. Several charred 
                    fragments were identified as corn (<em>Zea may</em>) and indicate 
                    that the inhabitants were farmers. Corn has been found in 
                    the village sites of the Antelope Creek and Buried City peoples, 
                    but this is the first time corn has been found in a village 
                    in the eastern half of the Canadian River valley. Corn remains 
                    were found on the floor of Hank's house and in the trash-filled 
                    storage features (Pits 2 and 3). </p>
                  <p class="text">Besides the corn, lots of fragments of charred 
                    sunflowers seeds were found on the house floor and in the 
                    central hearth. Because the seeds were all very small, we 
                    know that these were from wild sunflowers rather than the 
                    larger domesticated varieties. Plum pits also were found, 
                    particularly in the trash midden area in front of Hank's house. 
                    It was difficult to determine whether they were unburned or 
                    burned, but a few appear to have been roasted lightly, with 
                    the pits having been broken open to get at the tiny seed inside.</p>
                  <p class="text">Another interesting find in Hank's house was 
                    a burned clay mud-dauber's nest. This nest was built by flying 
                    wasps, probably the black and yellow mud-dauber (<em>Sceliphron 
                    caementarium</em>). Using mud from the creeks, they create 
                    organ-pipe nests composed of multiple tube-shaped cells. The 
                    wasps lay an egg inside each cell, and they add a collection 
                    of tiny spiders, still living but paralyzed by venom. When 
                    the egg hatches, the wasp larvae feeds on the spiders until 
                    it matures and breaks out of the cell. Mud-daubers commonly 
                    build their nests in protected areas, such as underneath the 
                    overhanging eaves of houses or barns. Because mud-daubers 
                    have two generations of offspring a year&#151;one in the winter 
                    and one in the summer&#151;the nests found in prehistoric 
                    sites are not good indicators of the seasons when occupations 
                    occurred. The mud-dauber nest found at Hank's house has one 
                    sealed tube and one open tube, but it is not uncommon for 
                    larvae to never mature and emerge, and mud-dauber nests may 
                    survive intact for several years unless people remove them. 
                    These mud-daubers are not particularly aggressive, but people 
                    at Hank's site would have viewed them as pests because their 
                    stings are rather painful. Mud-dauber nests are very common 
                    in abandoned houses, and the burned nest found inside Hank's 
                    house would have come from the inside. Although it is not 
                    conclusive, this could be evidence that the house had been 
                    abandoned for at least a few months in the winter or summer 
                    before it burned. </p>
                  <h3><a name="dating"></a>Dating: When was Hank's House Built? 
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text">Three <strong>radiocarbon dates</strong> provide the best 
                    evidence of when Hank's house was built. The first date was 
                    obtained from a large chunk of charred wood taken during the 
                    initial site investigation. This sample represented wood from 
                    the roof of the house that burned and collapsed onto the floor, 
                    but we believe the date on this sample is too old because 
                    of the <strong>old wood problem</strong>. To illustrate the old wood 
                    problem, bear in mind that the radiocarbon dating method measures 
                    the time elapsed since an organism, a tree in this case, died 
                    rather than the time elapsed since the burning episode. This 
                    is because living organisms continue to &quot;cycle&quot; 
                    atmospheric carbon and accumulate tiny fractions of radioactive 
                    carbon-14 (C14). Once they die, the accumulated C14 slowly 
                    decays, or breaks down, from its radioactive form into nitrogen-N14. 
					By measuring the ratio of C14 to stable carbon isotopes C12 and C13, 
                    we can estimate the elapsed time since the organism died. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Since the first sample from Hank's was only 
                    a section of a burned branch, it may have been from the core 
                    of the branch rather than the outer rings. Since the interior 
                    core wood of a tree branch is dead while the outer rings are 
                    living, a date on core wood could be much older than the actual 
                    time the tree died. Unfortunately, there is often no way to 
                    evaluate this. It also is possible that the sample represents 
                    old wood that was used long after the tree had died. If a 
                    branch that had been dead for many years was used in the construction 
                    of the roof of the house, a radiocarbon date from it would 
                    be much older than the actual time when the house was built 
                    and used. Keep in mind that in circumstances where wood is 
                    scarce, like the Texas Panhandle, prehistoric peoples often 
                    reused the timbers of old houses to build new houses. Such 
                    recycled timbers protected inside a house could be tens or 
                    even hundreds of years old. It is not uncommon to encounter 
                    situations where a radiocarbon date representing the death 
                    of a tree is many years older than&#151;even a century or 
                    two before&#151;the actual event that an archeologist is trying 
                    to date.</p>
                  <p class="text">When we got back the first date in the fall 
                    of 2000, we had no reason to doubt it, but we knew from experience 
                    that it is risky to rely on a single radiocarbon date. <strong>Radiocarbon 
                    dating is a statistical estimation technique </strong>and any statistician 
                    knows that the larger your sample size, the more confident 
                    of the estimate you can be. In our case, &quot;large sample 
                    size&quot; meant getting more than one date, and that is exactly 
                    what we did. So two more dates were run; this time we were 
                    careful to minimize the risk of the old wood problem. </p>
                  <p class="text">The other dates are better indicators of the 
                    true age of Hank's house. <strong>The second date was from the 
                    outer rings of the large juniper post</strong> found in the house. 
                    While the 8-inch-diameter post is composed of many tree rings, 
                    only the outermost ring was living at the time the tree was 
                    cut. By selecting a sample of only the outer two or three 
                    rings, the radiocarbon date will represent the last two or 
                    three years of the tree's life. <strong>The third date was on charred 
                    corn cupule fragments</strong> recovered from the floor of Hank's 
                    house. Since corn plants only live for one year, the radiocarbon 
                    date on this sample represents the year the corn cob was harvested. 
                    It is likely that the corn cupule was burned when the discarded 
                    corn cob was used as fuel and trampled into the floor the 
                    same year that the plant was harvested. The corn fragment 
                    was trampled into the floor where it lay for about 700 years 
                    until archeologists dug it up.</p>

                          that form tiny holes along its edges. It is, in fact,

                          the 700-year-old nest found in Hank's house contained 
                          four cells, one of which is complete and still sealed. 
                          The nest survived because the mud was baked when the 
                          house burned. Photos by Doug Boyd.<br>

                          to a piece of cut lumber. In contrast, the back of the

                  <p class="text">When these two radiocarbon ages (numbers 2 and 
                    3 in above chart) are <strong>calibrated </strong>(a method of increasing 
                    accuracy by comparing individual dates with a well-dated chronology 
                    of individual tree rings), the resulting dates overlap. The 
                    cutting of the tree marks the construction of the house and 
                    the harvesting of the corn marks an activity that occurred 
                    while people were living in the house, probably no more than 
                    15 years after the house was built. These two dates are essentially 
                    contemporaneous (statistically speaking, they overlap at the 
                    1-sigma level) and may be averaged using a special statistical 
                    technique. This technique showed that there is a 95% probability 
                    that the construction and use of Hank's house occurred between 
                    A.D. 1276 to 1391. This places the occupation of Hank's house 
                    squarely within the Plains Village period in the Texas Panhandle, 
                    which is thought to date from A.D. 1200 to 1450. Unfortunately, 
                    a more precise estimate is not possible due to the accuracy 
                    limitations of radiocarbon dating. All things considered, 
                    <strong>we think it is likely that the house was used during the 
                    early 1300s</strong>. (We could improve the estimate with additional 
                    dates, but this is quite expensive&#151;radiocarbon dates 
                    on small samples cost about $600 each.)</p>
