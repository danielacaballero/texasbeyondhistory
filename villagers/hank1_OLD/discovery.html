            <p class="text">It all started with a horseback ride in the spring 
              of 2000. Rancher John Erickson was out tending cattle when he came 
              across an interesting find. By this time, Erickson knew much about 
              the prehistoric people who had lived in the area where his ranch 
              now stood. He had been bitten by the archeology bug and had trained 
              his keen eyes to search for flint chips, bone fragments, burned 
              caliche rocks, and other clues of long-forgotten peoples. On this 
              particular occasion while riding along a creek bottom, he noticed 
              some black stains buried in the edge of the cutbank. He instinctively 
              knew that it was probably charcoal, or burned wood, and that it 
              might be part of a prehistoric site. He stopped for a moment to 
              investigate. Convinced it was probably worth a closer look at some 
              later time, Erickson went on searching for his cattle but filed 
              away the location of this new find in his mind.</p>
            <p class="text">A few months later, the &quot;Two Dougs&quot; (Wilkens 
              and Boyd) visited the ranch and Erickson showed us some of the archeological 
              sites he had found. Prior to this trip, Wilkens and Erickson had 
              spent many days recording and investigating sites on the ranch, 
              and Boyd had visited on one other occasion. We knew that there were 
              lots of interesting archeological sites on the ranch, but all three 
              of us were surprised and excited by what we discovered on this particular 
              day&#151;July 16, 2000.</p>
            <p class="text">Erickson took us back to the creek where he had found 
              the charcoal. It looked interesting, so we began looking closer. 
              Creek cutbanks have a way of hiding buried things, so it took us 
              a few minutes to carefully trowel away the thin layer of rain-washed 
              soil that had already covered the charred patch Erickson had seen 
              before. Once we got a good look at the freshly exposed strata, the 
              extent of the find became obvious. A horizontal line of charcoal 
              could be traced for nearly 20 ft (about 6 meters) along the cutbank. 
              There were masses of burned branches and smaller twigs, along with 
              burned clay lumps (called daub) that had impressions of sticks in 
              them. In the center and just below the charcoal line was a bowl-shaped 
              depression outlined by thick, bright orange burned clay and filled 
              with gray ash and brown sand. The signs were unmistakable&#151;it 
              was the floor of a pithouse and a firepit buried by layers of sand 
              laid down by the stream. Because there was so much charcoal and 
              daub, we speculated that the upper portion of the house had burned, 
              and the wood and clay from the roof had collapsed onto the floor. 
              Because most prehistoric houses in this area have a firepit or hearth 
              right in the center, we realized the creek had sliced this house 
              exactly in two. </p>
            <p class="text">Such finds are fairly rare, even for archeologists&#151;in 
              just a few minutes we had exposed a prehistoric house sliced in 
              half as neatly as any archeological excavation could have done. 
              In our excitement, the questions flowed quickly: How old was this 
              house? Was it part of a village? What other surprises did the cutbank 
              hold? </p>
            <p class="text">We spent more time looking along the cutbank near 
              the house and found flint flakes and some sherds of cordmarked pottery. 
              The pottery told us that the house probably belonged to the Plains 
              Woodland or Plains Village peoples who inhabited this stretch of 
              the Canadian River valley between about A.D. 200 and 1450. Because 
              the sherds were fairly thick&#151;thicker than the typical late 
              Borger Cordmarked variety&#151;we suspected that it could be from 
              the Plains Woodland or early Plains Village periods.</p>
            <p class="text">The thrill of discovery continued as we three explorers 
              found a storage pit, exposed in the same cutbank about 50 feet (15 
              meters) away from the buried pithouse. The pit, dug into the ground 
              by prehistoric people, was a typical &quot;bell-shaped&quot; storage 
              pit like those used by many Southern Plains villagers. These pits 
              were circular on the top, and, like the Liberty Bell, expanded out 
              into a flat bottom. </p>
            <p class="text">The excitement wasn't over just yet. As we continued 
              our search farther away from the buried pithouse, we found more 
              evidence of prehistoric occupations. Flint flakes, bone fragments, 
              and pottery sherds were strewn along the cutbank of the meandering 
              stream channel as far as 650 feet (nearly 200 meters) to the west 
              of the buried house. More artifacts and dark stains in the ranch 
              road marked locations of other probable buried houses some 980 feet 
              (nearly 300 meters) to the south. Most of the intervening area had 
              a thick layer of sand dunes that completely covered the alluvial 
              terrace, but these finds indicated that buried cultural deposits 
              could be present over an area of 645,500 square feet (60,000 square 
              meters) or over 13 football fields or more!</p>
            <p class="text">We returned to Erickson's house for lunch and reported 
              the interesting finds to John's wife, Kris, and son, Mark. The whole 
              group of us then returned to the site and spent much of the afternoon 
              recording archeological details about the new site. As we carefully 
              excavated and bagged a small sample of charcoal from the burned 
              pithouse for radiocarbon dating, we speculated on the possible age 
              of the buried house. Later in the evening as the sun began to sink 
              below the canyon rim at the ranch house, everyone sat on the Erickson's 
              front porch to discuss the day's events. The significance of the 
              day's finds was beginning to sink in. </p>
            <p class="text">John's sharp eyes and inquisitive mind had led to 
              the discovery of a burned prehistoric pithouse, a relatively rare 
              occurrence. Even more important, the discovery included a whole 
              village site, apparently a large one, in an area where few such 
              sites were known. Only a tiny portion of the site was visible, but 
              it was clear that many other houses and other evidence of prehistoric 
              life remain buried there. Such discoveries do not happen every day. 
              Everything considered, July 16, 2000, was an exciting day for Panhandle 
              archeology. I suggested that this new site be called Hank's site 
              in honor of Hank the Cowdog. The name stuck, and from that point 
              on, everyone referred to the buried pithouse as Hank's house. </p>
