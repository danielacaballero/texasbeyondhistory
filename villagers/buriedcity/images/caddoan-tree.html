    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->This diagram shows the relationships 
      among the various Caddoan languages and indicates the order in which the 
      various language groups are thought to have split from one another. How 
      long ago the various splits occurred is  not well known. Linguistic estimates 
      suggest that, prior to about 3,500 years ago, the ancestors of all of the 
      groups were a single people who spoke an ancestral language that linguists 
      call Proto-Caddoan. About 3,500 years ago (1500 B.C.) the ancestors of the 
      Northern Caddoan groups split from the Caddo and the two languages began 
      to diversify. (Some archeologists think the initial split may have occurred 
      thousands of years earlier.) Sometime after the time of Christ, the Proto-Northern-Caddoan 
      speakers began splitting off, first the Wichita (about A.D. 500), then the 
      Kitsai, and finally the Pawnee. Still later (not long before Europeans arrived) 
      the Arikara split from the Pawnee, and the Pawnee split into two groups.<!-- #EndEditable --></td>
