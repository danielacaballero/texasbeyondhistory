                  <p><em>In Ochiltree County, Texas, on the south bank of Wolf 
                    Creek, is a group of stone ruins which has aroused the interest 
                    and curiosity of all who have visited them, and caused much 
                    speculation among those who have tried to formulate a theory 
                    to account for their existence. It is a firmly established 
                    opinion of many who live in the vicinity that the place where 
                    these ruins are was at one time the site of a prehistoric 
                    town. This opinion was deduced largely from the fact that 
                    the remains resemble to a marked degree the foundations of 
                    large buildings. &#133; The place has long been known as &quot;The

                    in the Southern Plains</strong>. Packed into a few short miles 
                    of narrow Wolf Creek valley are more than 100 known habitation 
                    sites with the remains of houses mainly built by Plains Villagers 
                    between about A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1400. It is very likely that

                    Wolf Creek and to the Plains Village culture that called this 
                    place home 700 years ago.</p>
                  <p class="text">Since the 1920s Buried City has been equated 
                    with one or another surrounding prehistoric cultures including 
                    the Pueblo &quot;Cliff Dwellers&quot; of the American Southwest, 
                    the Antelope Creek villagers of the Canadian River, and the 
                    Woodland &quot;Mound Builders&quot; of the Kansas City area 
                    and points further east. Today the facts, as we see them,  don't fit any of these notions. Instead, investigations 
                    over the past two decades have shown that Buried City was 
                    part of a distinct culture of its own, one of a growing number 
                    of variations on the Plains 
                    Village theme that archeologists now recognize. </p>
                  <p class="text">The people of the Buried City practiced horticulture, 
                    a form of low-intensity gardening that led to full-scale agriculture 
                    in other areas. They grew corn and probably squash, beans, 
                    and other crops. But they were also buffalo hunters and hunters 
                    of deer and other game. And they harvested wild fruits, seeds, 
                    flowers, and other plant foods. For more than three centuries, 
                    people lived, worked, planted, and harvested crops, hunted, 
                    and died along this small stretch of Wolf Creek in what is today 
                    the Texas Panhandle. </p>

                  <h3>Natural Setting </h3>
                  <p class="text">To understand a people, you need to understand 
                    the place where they lived, how they lived, and the limits 
                    the natural world imposed upon them. People who first encounter 
                    the High Plains of the northern Texas Panhandle today think 
                    of it in terms of a boundless expanse of grass, wheat, and 
                    cattle. Its most remarkable feature is that it is billiard-table 
                    flat: you can see the clump of trees miles before you get 
                    close to a modern farmstead. The other striking feature, literally, 
                    is the wind. The normal southwest (spring and summer) or northwest 
                    (fall and winter) breezes blow at 5 to 15 miles per hour day 
                    and night and then there are the windy days when it really 
                    howls. To natives of the Panhandle, the more remarkable moments 
                    are those rare days when the wind is NOT blowing. </p>
                  <p class="text">On paper, the annual rainfall of 16 to 20 inches 
                    makes the area seem ideal for grain agriculture, but much 
                    of that rainfall typically comes in only a half-dozen torrential 
                    thundershowers in the late spring. Because the area is dry 
                    most of the year, water is a constant concern. On the High 
                    Plains the scattered playa lakes (round, natural depressions 
                    that formed tens of thousands of years ago) hold some water 
                    from the spring rains through much of the summer, but in dry 
                    times access to water becomes a problem. The best water available 
                    comes from the Pliocene age <strong>Ogallala geological formation</strong> 
                    that forms the <strong>caprock</strong> of the Texas Panhandle. Depth 
                    from the modern surface to the water-bearing part of the Ogallala 
                    varies from less than 100 feet to over 200 feet. The major 
                    stream valleys have in many instances cut down into the Ogallala, 
                    providing access to freshwater springs along the margins of 
                    their valleys.</p>
                  <p class="text">Because of this geography and climate, few prehistoric 
                    peoples lived on the high plains. Rather, they lived along 
                    the streams that cut across the High Plains, streams like 
                    the Canadian River and Wolf Creek. These stream valleys provide 
                    access to spring water from the Ogallala, a much wider variety 
                    of plants and animals than the short-grass prairies of the 
                    High Plains provide, and shelter from the winds. Such places 
                    are truly oases on the plains. </p>

                  <p class="text">Because Wolf Creek flows west to east, its narrow, 
                    entrenched valley offers shelter from the prevailing southwest 
                    and north winds. In prehistory Wolf Creek was attractive to 
                    game of all sorts, the stream contained several varieties 
                    of fish and shellfish, and the banks supported dense woods. 
                    Although they are all but gone today, the narrow stream-side forests along Wolf Creek and other 
                    parallel drainages are the westernmost fingers of the Eastern Woodlands, 
                    narrow ribbons that stood in woody contrast to the grassy 
                    High Plains. </p>
                  <p class="text">People probably first visited this idyllic setting 
                    during Paleoindian times, although no definitive evidence 
                    of this is known. Scattered finds of Archaic artifacts show 
                    that people have been spending time along Wolf Creek since 
                    at least 6,000 years ago and there is evidence of at least 
                    intermittent occupation throughout the remaining prehistoric 
                    era. Archeological investigations have focused on the latest 
                    of these prehistoric occupants: the Plains villagers of about 
                    600-1000 years ago. These people lived along the banks of 
                    Wolf Creek on a year-round basis. They made several kinds 
                    of houses including dwellings with stick and post walls built 
                    on the unimproved ground surface, small houses built over 
                    or in small, shallow pits, and large houses with boulder wall 
                    bases and massive central supports. These latter houses are 
                    what have lured archeologists into the Wolf Creek valley for 
                    the past hundred years. Advances in remote sensing technology 
                    have begun to make it feasible to locate and explore the more 
                    ephemeral and less obvious houses, of which there are probably 
                    a great many. </p>
