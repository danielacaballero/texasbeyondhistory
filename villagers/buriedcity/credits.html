            <p class="text">The Buried City exhibit was written by <strong>Dr. 
              David T. Hughes</strong>, associate professor of anthropology at 
              Wichita State University, where he has taught since 1988. Hughes 
              has been directing field investigations and subsequent analysis 
              of Buried City since 1985. Son of Jack T. Hughes, David has been 
              involved in archeology since early childhood. He holds a Ph.D. from 
              the University of Oklahoma. He makes his home in Newton, Kansas 
              where he lives with wife Dr. Alicia Hughes-Jones, a fellow archeologist 
              who has served as David's confidant, editor, goad, colleague, office 
              manager, lab manager, co-project director, and sounding board. As 
              he puts it, &quot;Whatever I may have accomplished is at least as 
              much the result of her efforts as of my own.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">David got his first field experience excavating bison 
              kill sites under Billy Harrison in 1968, had his first technical 
              report published in 1974, and has been actively doing archeological 
              research for over 35 years. Hughes has published dozens of technical 
              reports and scholarly articles. He has worked with Earl Greene at 
              Ft. McKavett, Frank Weir for the Texas Department of Highways and 
              Transportation, Vance Haynes at the Lehner and Murray Springs sites, 
              Don Wyckoff at the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey, and scores of 
              people on contracts and summer employment in Alaska, North Dakota, 
              Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, and 
              beyond. In recent years his interests have broadened to include 
              ethnohistory and ethnography. He has directed ethnographic studies 
              in St. Louis and Pipestone, Minnesota as well as extensive ethnohistoric 
              studies for Pipestone National Monument and for the Scotts Bluff 
              and Agate Fossil Quarries National Monuments in Nebraska.</p>
            <p class="text">The investigations at the Buried City since 1985 were 
              funded largely by the <strong>Harold Courson family </strong>with 
              additional support from the field schools of the Texas Archeological 
              Society and Wichita State University, as well as small private contributions. 
              Institutional support in the form of personnel and facilities was 
              provided by the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, the Texas Historical 
              Commission Office of the State Archeologist, the University of Oklahoma, 
              and Wichita State University, among others. </p>
            <p class="text">The photographs used here were taken by David T. Hughes, 
              Madeline Jeffress, Steve Black, and Wallace Williams. Many photographs 
              were drawn from the Courson Archeological collection currently housed 
              at Wichita State University. Graphics and maps were prepared by 
              Hughes as part of past or planned publications on the Buried City. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The ideas and concepts presented here resulted from 
              observations made during the investigations and were refined, expanded 
              or, in some cases altered, as the result of conversations with other 
              archeologists such as Don Blakeslee, Todd Bevitt, Scott Brosowske, 
              Doug Boyd, Joan Few, Mott Davis, Tom Ellzey, Billy and Donna Harrison, 
              Jack Hughes, Ron Ralph, Harry Shafer, Susan Vehik, and Doug Wilkens, 
              and many others. </p>
            <p class="text">The list of crew members involved in the Buried City 
              research would fill several pages. We began with a crew of five 
              in 1985, expanded to about 15 in 1986, had 300 TAS members in 1987, 
              and by some reports, 400 in 1988. In 1990 WSU students involved 
              in the Temple excavation numbered about 40 all told. Alicia Hughes-Jones 
              was the lab and office manager, records concordance supervisor, 
              and co-director throughout. Danny Witt was a key local informant 
              and expediter as well as willing and informed worker in all phases 
              of the work. The Courson family has volunteered their time, talent, 
              and perspiration as well as fiscal support, ever willing to offer 
              advice, suggestions, and labor when needed. The efforts of all who 
              have helped on Buried City are greatly appreciated.</p>
