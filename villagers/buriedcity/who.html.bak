            <p class="text"><em>In this interpretive essay, David Hughes takes 
              a big-picture look at Buried City: who lived there and when, where, why and how? 
              Big-picture understandings of the human past are the hardest of 
              all to see with clarity, especially when expressed in typical, qualify-everything 
              academic writing. Here David takes a more personal and direct approach. 
              </em> </p>
            <p class="text">Archeology is many things. It is the study of the 
              past, the scientific study of the past, the science of the past, 
              and the humanities thread that weaves the social sciences, the hard 
              sciences, and the arts into a common fabric. All of these elements 
              are present in the archeological history of Wolf Creek, from the 
              early exploratory searches of Eyerly to the efforts by Moorehead 
              to find on the Plains the predecessors of the Pueblo Cliff-Dwelling 
              peoples. Fewkes' and Ellzey were looking for that most elusive of 
              things: information. My own investigations sought to find and understand 
              the Buried City of published and contemporary legend. The ongoing 
              work by the University of Oklahoma seeks new scientific data to 
              test hypotheses about suspected cultural connections across the 
              Southern Plains.</p>
            <p class="text">These are among the varieties of archeological practice, 
              past and present. Yet there is a common thread that ties them all 
              together. It is a thread spun from the human condition that weaves 
              perpetually through the minds of those drawn to the past by something 
              they have seen, heard, or thought about the people of the past. 
              The strands of the thread are as many as those whose lives it touches, 
              but its basic elements are known to every social studies teacher, 
              practicing archeologist, and museum receptionist. When people encounter 
              strange things from the past that they can see are human in origin, 
              most ask first: <strong>Who were they?</strong> The next questions are almost 
              as predictable: <strong>Where did they come from? When were they here?</strong> 
              <strong>Why did they leave? Where did they go?</strong> When we examine Buried 
              City's investigators and their motives from any time, we see that 
              these basic human questions also have driven the archeology along 
              Wolf Creek.</p>
            <p class="text">In this exhibit we have tried on several levels to 
              answer these questions. Although they are of few words, the questions 
              are not as simple as they may sound. Who were they? This question 
              can be meant narrowly or broadly. Archeologically, we cannot now 
              or ever know the names of the individuals who lived at Buried City, 
              one facet of &quot;who.&quot; Because the modern forms of the organized 
              Indian tribes seem to have taken shape only in the recent past, 
              we cannot even say what tribe or ethnicity these people would have 
              identified themselves with, another facet of &quot;who.&quot; Yet 
              we can tell a bit of the story about how they lived, what their 
              homes were like, and hints of some of their choices, entertainment, 
              adornment, diet, tools, and other things. We know that they had 
              their own ways of building houses and made their clay pots different 
              in subtle and great detail from those of their neighbors. We know 
              they were farmers, hunters, and gatherers, that they raised families 
              and had homes of some permanence. This is certainly all part of 
              the &quot;who&quot; question, but is at times quite unsatisfying. 
              <strong>Is that all there is that we can know?</strong></p>
            <p class="text">Each of us carries our past with us in this world, 
              and the same was true of the prehistoric people of Wolf Creek. We 
              don't know from whence they came with any certainty, but archeologists 
              have detected some suggestive patterns. Going well beyond  Wolf 
              Creek, and well before the Buried City in time, changes were afoot 
              on the Southern Plains more than a millennium before Julius Cesar 
              ruled Rome. About 3,500-4,000 years ago a long era of warm and dry 
              climatic conditions (sometimes called the Altithermal) came to an 
              end as the climate gradually shifted toward recognizably modern 
              conditions. With cooler temperatures and more rainfall, the grasslands 
              of the Great Plains flourished and bison herds expanded their numbers 
              and their range. People weren't far behind, moving westward into 
              the Plains from the Eastern Woodlands, eastward from the Rocky Mountains, 
              southward from the Edwards Plateau, and probably from other directions 
              as well, drawn by the buffalo and more moderate conditions. </p>
            <p class="text">A dramatic archeological deposit in Bonfire Shelter 
              near present-day Langtry, Texas, dating to about 800 B.C. (2800 
              years ago) shows unambiguous evidence of the result of the expansion 
              of grasslands, of bison, and of bison hunting in the Southern Plains. 
              There, as many as 800 buffalo were driven off a cliff by Late Archaic hunters in one or 
              several closely spaced episodes . By 2000 
              years ago, bison hunting had became a common way of life in the 
              Southern Plains and on the Llano Estacado. But then the climate 
              shifted back toward warmer/drier conditions and bison numbers once 
              again thinned. These changes were likely gradual, intermittent, 
              and cumulative in nature, rather than continuous and abrupt, although 
              it must have felt abrupt the year the bison herds did not return. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">By about 1500 years ago the peoples whose ancestors 
              had hunted the buffalo had adopted  a more sedentary foraging 
              and gathering life, supplemented by deer hunting (Plains Woodland 
              cultures). The different traditions they had brought with them to 
              the hunt and had acquired in centuries of chasing the bison were 
              the foundation for their new lifestyles. As they settled into the 
              wooded and well-watered valleys on the Plains, each community had 
              a unique blend of attitudes, ideas, and knowledge. Communication 
              among groups was reduced, simply because people were staying in 
              one place for longer and taking advantage of local resources. To 
              be sure there was still some exchange of materials and information 
              across the High Plains, but less than there was before and would 
              be again during the bison-rich eras. The people living in each small 
              valley followed their own traditions to which they added new 
              ideas and things like pottery making, horticulture, and building 
              durable structures. From this mix, the people of Buried City and 
              the many surrounding small-scale cultures developed and flourished. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">About 800 years ago (A.D. 1200) or so, climatic conditions 
              had once again improved and soon a lifestyle based on bison hunting 
              was again feasible. Plains groups were probably on the move exploring 
              new places, new ways, and now-new peoples they had once known in 
              legendary times. <strong>The presence of bison herds was fundamentally 
              important:</strong> across the world, intensive farming societies have 
              been allied historically with pastoral societies in a near symbiotic 
              relationship exchanging grain, labor, and manufactured goods for 
              hides, meat, and other animal products. There were no large domesticated 
              animals in North America, but bison hunting was the next best thing&#151;maybe 
              even better because they took care of themselves.</p>
            <p class="text">This was Buried City's heyday, a several-century period 
              during which bison herds regularly ranged the Texas Panhandle and 
              dry-land corn farming was successful more often than not in the 
              wooded and well-watered valleys. But this lifeway didn't last long 
              and probably no later than A.D. 1400, and certainly, by A.D. 1450, people 
              abandoned Wolf Creek. Over the next century they apparently returned 
              sporadically to hunt, revisit important places, and perhaps even 
              tried to resettle the valley. If so, the resettlement effort was 
              unsuccessful and Wolf Creek became just another stopping place for 
              the later Plains nomads groups that took over the Texas Panhandle 
              during the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>
            <p class="text">We don't know precisely why the Buried City people left, 
              but the classic reasons given for any precipitous abandonment of 
              a region include: drought, crop failures, war, floods, and other 
              more idiosyncratic reasons. One little-considered possibility is 
              that which we can see effecting under-industrialized towns across 
              northwest Mexico today: deforestation. Without firewood, homes cannot 
              be heated in the winter, food remains raw, and hides can't be smoked 
              for waterproofing. Without wood for walls and roof supports, no 
              new homes can be built, there isn't spare wood to build racks for 
              drying hides or to use as arbors to stave off the summer heat. I 
              think it likely that the Buried City people occupied a timbered oasis in 
              the semi-arid sea of grass 800 years ago and after only 8 or 10 
              generations, perhaps 250 years, the wood and other resources that 
              lured people here had been depleted. They had no choice but to move. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">We can also see some other interesting possibilities. 
              Elsewhere on this website is a discussion of the <a href="../../tejas/fundamentals/languages.html" class="text">history 
              of Caddoan-speaking peoples.</a> There the results of a dating technique 
              known as glottochronology (estimating tongue-time, if you will) 
              are summarized. If these estimates are right, the speakers of the 
              Northern Caddoan languages split off from the Southern Caddoans 
              (Caddo proper) at about 3,500 years ago: the very time during which 
              the Plains saw a revival of bison hunting that may have enticed 
              outsiders to move to the prairies. The onset of the Woodland period 
              (and coincidentally the end of the bison hunting for the time being) 
              at about 1500 years ago happens to be about the same time the Wichita 
              speakers split from the speakers of other Northern Caddoan languages 
              (Pawnee, Arikira, and Kitsai). </p>
            <p class="text">You can, perhaps, see where I am going with this. 
              I should pause to admit that my interest in such broad parallels 
              in culture and biology and in the history of the Caddoan language 
              family has a genetic link. My father, Jack T. Hughes, wrote his 
              dissertation on the <em>Prehistory of the Caddoan-speaking Tribe</em>s 
              (Columbia University, 1968) and tried to trace Caddoan peoples through 
              time and across space. But even he dared not draw historical connections 
              with such a broad brush for such a significant span of time (at 
              least not in print). Mindful that I am skating on thin, speculative 
              ice, I offer the following scenario of how the Buried City may have 
              come to be, where its people came from, why they left, and where 
              they are now. </p>
            <p class="text">At the end of the long drought or Altithermal, the 
              Great Plains regained its character as an inviting sea of grass, 
              and bison began returning in numbers unprecedented in living memory. 
              Hunters and foragers from the Plains margins, east, west, and south, 
              were quick to take advantage of the much-improved situation and 
              abandoned their root-baking pits, fish weirs, and deer nets to seek 
              their lives on the buffalo prairies, just as protohistoric Puebloan 
              peoples did annually. They began on the margins of the Plains where 
              they could find the basic necessities with which they were familiar 
              and moved farther and farther out on to the Plains. There they met 
              others whose ancestors had stayed on the Plains and still others 
              who came from the opposite direction. These born-again hunters probably 
              formed a multitude of different groups, sharing a common purpose 
              and direction: making a living off the bison. It does not seem unreasonable 
              to suggest that, in such circumstances, diverse groups would have 
              rapidly adopted the same material culture (types of tools and ways 
              of making things), as did the historic Plains nomads who came from 
              all directions to hunt the buffalo after A.D. 1700. </p>
            <p class="text">The chases of these Late Archaic hunters took them 
              up and down the Plains as far as the buffalo could go and, when 
              the buffalo again ran out, they settled to the well-watered stream 
              valleys and took up their remembered old ways of foraging and small-game 
              hunting in a new place with new game and new plants. They continued 
              this way, growing in place, to become the classic Plains margin 
              dwellers of Antelope Creek, the people who lived in Hank's house 
              north of the Canadian River, the Buried City people, and the people 
              of other archeological Plains Village cultures from south-central 
              Kansas west to Shattuck, Oklahoma, south across the Red River, and 
              then finally east to the north Texas area with the Henrietta complex. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">As they settled into their valleys, the Plains villagers 
              developed local customs based upon those they remembered from elder 
              times, those they had acquired from travelers and sojourners who 
              joined their group, and those they needed to survive in their particular 
              place. These ideas shared a common cultural root or what anthropologist 
              Julian Steward called a &quot;culture core,&quot; and so reflect 
              strong degrees of similarity, and yet differences are also abundant 
              because of isolation, local changes, and idiosyncrasies enhanced 
              into local cultural traditions. </p>
            <p class="text">Through time, our traveling people, Caddoan-speakers 
              I think, who had moved west from the Caddo Homeland in eastern Texas 
              and Oklahoma, began to grow and prosper in their new land. They 
              kept their communication with old friends and kin and so traded 
              ideas and materials up and down the margin of the High Plains. When 
              the buffalo returned, about 700-800 years ago, they took advantage 
              of the newly available food source and grew more prosperous and 
              numerous, they traded more, and they became inordinately fond of 
              corn, which they grew in their protected valleys. The ancestors 
              of Woodland gardeners were rapidly becoming true farmers and village 
              dwellers. No sooner had this process been well begun than it ended 
              all across the southern Plains. The abandonment of Buried City may 
              have anticipated other areas because of the exhaustion of wood and 
              other local resources, but that cannot explain the regional pattern. 
            </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>The people of Buried City and other Southern Plains 
              villages are the likely ancestors of the Northern Caddoan or Plains 
              Caddoan peoples</strong>: the Wichita, Pawnee, Arikara, Kitsai, and others 
              whose names are lost in time. Who were the people of Buried City? 
              Traces of them can be found in all of these modern peoples. Where 
              did they come from? They came from elsewhere (mainly to the east) 
              to arrive here. They followed the herds, their dreams, and, no doubt, 
              the rich stories of their elders to get here. Why did they leave? 
              I really wish I knew for sure. </p>
            <p class="text">But, then, isn't that part of what keeps us coming 
              back to the past? Trying to answer just one more question? </p>

                  ago the various splits occurred is not well known. Linguistic 
                  estimates suggest that, prior to about 3,500 years ago, the 
                  ancestors of all of the groups were a single people who spoke 
                  an ancestral language that linguists call Proto-Caddoan. About 
                  3,500 years ago (1500 B.C.) the ancestors of the Northern Caddoan 
                  groups split from the Caddo and the two languages began to diversify. 
                  (Some archeologists think the initial split may have occurred 
                  thousands of years earlier.) Sometime after the time of Christ, 
                  the Proto-Northern-Caddoan speakers began splitting off, first 
                  the Wichita (about A.D. 500), then the Kitsai, and finally the 
                  Pawnee. Still later (not long before Europeans arrived) the 
                Arikara split from the Pawnee, and the Pawnee split into two groups.</div></td>
