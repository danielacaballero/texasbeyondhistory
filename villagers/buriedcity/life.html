            <p class="text">The people of the Buried City were gardeners, hunters, 
              and foragers. We know they raised <strong>corn </strong>and we strongly suspect 
              they also grew other crops like beans, squash, and chili peppers, 
              although these don't preserve well archeologically. Crops were 
              probably planted in the low-lying swales between houses and along 
              the valley floor (floodplain). During especially wet years when 
              floodwater occasionally inundated the valley floor, simple diversion 
              dams (lines of stones and/or rows of bushes) across the swales would 
              have kept the fields wet enough for good crops. This strategy is 
              similar to the <strong>Ak-Chin dryland farming technique</strong> used in 
              northwest Mexico and southern Arizona by various groups including 
              the Pima and Tohono O'odham people (who are collectively known as 
              the Ak-Chin, from the O'odham word meaning &quot;place where the 
              wash loses itself in the sand or ground&quot;). During dry years 
              when the swale crops might not have been successful, those planted 
              in the valley floors would have had sufficient moisture to grow. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The abundant bison bone on the Buried City sites shows 
              that <strong>buffalo hunting was important</strong>. Buffalo provided meat 
              and many other useful products including hides and bones for tools. 
              We also find deer bones and antlers as tools so they were hunting 
              white-tail deer in the local area. (Antelope and deer bones are 
              quite similar and it is likely that antelope were also killed.) 
              In addition to large mammals, the bones of smaller critters are common 
              in the sites including those of cottontail, jackrabbit, turtles, 
              and frogs, as well as sunfish bones, drum fish teeth and abundant 
              freshwater mussels. </p>
            <p class="text">The vegetation in the area was diverse and the people 
              used western red-heart cedar as main support posts for the houses, 
              plum and winged elm wood for the wall posts, and lashed them all together 
              with willow withes, grape vines, and twigs of plum and elm. The 
              hearths contained charred wood from oak, elm, juniper, plum, cottonwood, 
              and other species of trees. One visitor suggested that the oak-charcoal 
              layers in the firepits may represent winter-time use, while the 
              cottonwood charcoal and ash probably represent summer fires, the 
              difference being whether you want a long-term fire to keep the house 
              warm all night or a quick fire just to heat a meal. </p>
            <p class="text">The primary gardening tool was a <strong>digging stick 
              with a bone tip </strong>made from a bison tibia (lower leg bone&#151;which 
              is thick and tough). Such tools had wooden handles inserted into 
              the end of the tibia (which had been cut or broken out) and may 
              have been used as hoes or as straight digging sticks/dibbles&#151;sort 
              of like a narrow-bladed trenching shovel. Bison scapulae (shoulder 
              blades) may also have been used to move loose dirt and for smoothing 
              plastered surfaces. No stone hoes or other digging tools have been 
              identified at Buried City sites. </p>

              native mussel shell may also have been used as pottery scraping

            <p class="text">Food was cooked and stored in locally made pottery 
              vessels. <strong>Buried City pottery</strong> was generally globular and about 
              8 to 12 inches in diameter, volleyball to basketball size, with 
              a constricted neck and a vertical rim. What sets Buried City pottery 
              apart from the similar-shaped pottery of the Antelope Creek area 
              (which is called Borger Cordmarked) is the abundant decoration of 
              the rims and the variety of surface finishes. About one-third of 
              the Buried City rim sherds include a variety of decorations like 
              fingernail impressions or gouging, impression of the rims with tools 
              like mussel shell, and thickening of the upper rim to form a collar. 
              We also see various incisions around the rim on the collar. In addition 
              to decorated rims, the pottery also includes cordmarked and smoothed 
              rims. Body sherds are most often cordmarked, but some seem to have been
              textured with some other kind of tool, and still others have been 
              carefully smoothed. This kind of decoration on rim sherds and variation 
              in surface finish is more often found on Central Plains Tradition 
              sites (in Kansas and further north) than it is in Southern Plains 
              village sites.</p>
            <p class="text"> <strong>Food</strong> was prepared in many ways including grinding, 
              and we find the remains of worn-out grinding slabs or metates in 
              all the sites as well as the hand stones or manos that were used 
              with them. </p>

            <p class="text"><strong>Tools </strong>for hunting, processing meat and hides, 
              and for other purposes were made of Alibates flint and other cherts 
              and jaspers. Despite the nearness of Buried City to the Alibates 
              Flint Quarries, there is little evidence of substantial access to 
              Alibates flint on Buried City sites. Brown jasper from western Kansas 
              makes up a measurable percentage of the tools, as does Tecovas jasper 
              from the southern Texas Panhandle. Additional evidence of limited 
              contact with the Alibates quarries is that almost all of the tools 
              find have been extensively re-worked, worn-out, and recycled prior 
              to discard and even the flint-knapping debris is extremely small 
              and almost any flake that could be held between two fingers shows 
              edge damage from use as a scraping or cutting tool. </p>
            <p class="text">The styles of stone tools are fairly typical for the 
              Southern Plains people of the 12th and 13th century. These include 
              various kinds of drills or perforators, diamond-shaped beveled knives 
              sometimes called Harahey knives, and side-notched, unnotched, and 
              side- and base-notched arrow points. For arrows to fly true and 
              arrive with enough impact to take down a bison or with enough accuracy for a 
              deer, they must be carefully worked. We see some evidence of the 
              care in arrow manufacture in the form of a bison rib shaft straightener 
              or shaft wrench and a grooved abrader for smoothing the shafts once 
              they were straightened </p>
            <p class="text">As rich as the material we have may seem, most of 
              the goods owned by the people of the Buried City didn't survive the 
              ravages of time. We know from the needles, awls, and other tools 
              that they probably had clothing, bags, boxes, and other materials 
              made of hides, probably had baskets, mats, and sandals of woven 
              goods, and many objects and tools of wood and other perishable remains 
              which don't normally preserve. </p>

                      Buried City house. All parts of a bison were found in this
