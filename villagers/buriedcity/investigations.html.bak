                  <p class="text">Anglo settlers had known of the archeological 
                    sites along Wolf Creek since the 1880s when the first land 
                    surveyors remarked on the stone-walled ruins while laying 
                    out land boundaries. As is often the case in small communities 
                    (and the Texas Panhandle at the beginning of the 20th century 
                    was a small community that extended over a large area), word 
                    of the unusual spread rapidly. At the time there was growing 
                    public interest in ancient ruins in the United States because 
                    of accounts of the exploration of spectacular architectural 
                    ruins like those in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico and Mesa Verde, 
                    Colorado, as well as the Hopewell burial mounds in the Ohio 
                    Valley. The ruins of masonry structures along Wolf Creek certainly 
                    qualified as unusual. </p>
                  <p class="text">By 1906, <strong>Floyd Studer</strong>, a student at Canadian 
                    Academy, a Baptist men's preparatory school in Canadian, Texas, 
                    had heard of the Buried City on Wolf Creek and began encouraging 
                    his natural history professor, <strong>T.L. Eyerly</strong>, to take 
                    the class there on a field trip. Eyerly did so in March, 1907. 
                    Time has left us meager record of Eyerly's work, but apparently 
                    he, Studer, and other students dug into one or more ruins 
                    over a period of a week or more. At the end of his investigations, 
                    Eyerly rejected the idea that the Buried City ruins represented 
                    occupation sites and concluded instead that they were burial 
                    mounds, perhaps like those of the Hopewellian culture of the 
                    Ohio Valley. <strong>Eyerly's initial work at the Buried City of 
                    the Panhandle is considered the first formal archeological 
                    investigation in Texas.</strong> Eyerly published a least four 
                    similar accounts of his work in various small journals between 
                    1907-1912 (<a href="images/eyerly-1912.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">download 
                    PDF file of 1912 article</a>).</p>
                  <p class="text">Learning of Eyerly's work, <strong>Jessie Walter 
                    Fewkes</strong> of the Bureau of American Ethnology at the Smithsonian 
                    Institution paid a brief visit to Buried City in 1914 or 1915. 
                    He apparently dug into at least one structure, finding a skeleton, 
                    but apparently did not find the site interesting in comparison 
                    to the more impressive ruins he was familiar with in the American 
                    Southwest.</p>
                  <p class="text">Young Floyd Studer's interest wasn't satisfied 
                    by Eyerly's brief investigation and his enthusiasm for archeology 
                    and Panhandle history continued to grow. Sometime around 1915,
                    Studer learned that the nationally famous archeologist <strong>Warren 
                    King Moorehead</strong> was considering undertaking exploration 
                    of the Arkansas River Valley. Studer began writing Moorehead 
                    in hope that he would include the Buried City and Canadian 
                    River sites in his investigations. </p>
                  <p class="text">Moorehead was then the curator of the Peabody 
                    Museum and director of the Department of Archaeology at Phillips 
                    Academy, a private preparatory school in Andover, Massachusetts. 
                    The museum was (and still is) devoted to the study of archeology 
                    and sponsored major expeditions to many parts of the country. 
                    Funding for expeditions depended on the support of wealthy 
                    New England patrons, such as Robert S. Peabody, who had founded 
                    the museum in 1901. By the early 1900s, Moorehead was a nationally 
                    known archeologist who had worked in many areas of the country. 
                    His two passions were archeological exploration and American 
                    Indians. As Douglas Byers put it in a 1939 eulogy, &quot;He 
                    worked tirelessly to ensure fair play to Indians in many parts 
                    of the country, and was their champion to the last.&quot; 
                    Among the best-known archeological cultures and sites that 
                    Moorehead investigated are the Fort Ancient culture of Ohio 
                    (where he grew up), the Hopewell mounds, the great site of 
                    Cahokia near St. Louis, and Etowah in Georgia.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1917 Moorehead hired Harvard-trained archeologist 
                    <strong>Fred Sterns</strong> to begin explorations along the Arkansas 
                    River drainage system. As a result of Studer's letters to 
                    Moorehead, Sterns visited the <strong>Handley Ranch</strong>, where 
                    the Buried City ruins stood, and carried out some further 
                    excavations. As with Eyerly, there is no surviving record 
                    of the extent, duration, or areas of Sterns' excavations. 
                    Moorehead and Sterns had a falling out in late 1917 over who 
                    had ownership rights to the artifacts and notes obtained during 
                    the investigations but the fate of those records is not known. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"> Moorehead then hired <strong>C. B. Franklin</strong> 
                    of Fort Smith, Arkansas to retrace Sterns' footsteps and do 
                    additional exploration in the Arkansas River. Franklin was 
                    untrained in archeology but observant and willing to travel 
                    by horse and buggy over rough terrain. As he noted on October 
                    9, 1919 he &quot;was advised by man just from there not to 
                    try and drive any further west as roads and country were too 
                    rough and there was too much sand for one horse outfit -- 
                    everyone seems surprised we got through this far.&quot; This 
                    belated advice came immediately after Franklin successfully 
                    spent some 11 days driving up to the Handley Ranch from Shattuck, 
                    Oklahoma, (7 miles east of the Texas state line) and returning. 
                    Franklin apparently did some additional work at the site (<a href="images/franklin-report.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">download 
                    PDF file of the original transcript of his field notes</a>). 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1920 Moorehead himself traveled to Wolf Creek 
                    to complete the work begun before the first World War. His 
                    investigations were hampered by a lack of available laborers 
                    and other problems, including a pending lawsuit against Sterns 
                    requesting that the field notes and collections he had gathered 
                    be submitted to Moorehead according to their contract. Moorehead's 
                    correspondence with Studer and Joseph Thoburn of Oklahoma 
                    indicates that the courts found in favor of Moorehead, but 
                    that Sterns planned to appeal the finding. No further information 
                    about the suit is known, but the courts may have kept the 
                    documents and artifacts pending Sterns' appeal. Because of 
                    these difficulties, Moorehead had to fund what would be his 
                    final season of work in the area by securing a mortgage on 
                    his own home. This allowed him to complete the work and placate 
                    his earlier sponsors. </p>
                  <p class="text">Moorehead compiled a crude map of the site and, 
                    despite not having much help, carried out additional excavations 
                    &quot;especially in Eyerly's &quot;'Temple,' or No. 10, which 
                    we called Gould ruin.&quot; Apparently he also felt obligated 
                    to backfill the excavations left open by previous investigators 
                    as he wrote:</p>

                  <p class="text">Although his Arkansas River Valley explorations 
                    were completed in 1921, Moorehead was soon distracted by work 
                    at several major mound sites including Cahokia and Etowah, 
                    and the results of his investigations of the Buried City languished 
                    until 1931 when his <em>Archeology of the Arkansas River Valley</em> 
                    was published. He remained at Phillips Academy until his retirement 
                    in 1938, shortly before his death. Moorehead is said to have 
                    been a sensitive and retiring person who took great umbrage 
                    at perceived (or actual) slights and professional criticisms. 
                    In an era of growing professionalization of the discipline 
                    of archeology, Warren King Moorehead was one of the last of 
                    the &quot;old school&quot; of 19th century, self-trained archeologists. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The friendly relations between Studer, also 
                    a largely self-taught archeologist, and Moorehead continued 
                    for many years after completion of these early investigations. 
                    Correspondence between them suggests that Moorehead may have 
                    played a significant role in encouraging Studer's participation 
                    in the founding of the <strong>Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum</strong>. 
                    Studer continued his interest in archeology through this new 
                    forum and was instrumental in arranging Works Progress Administration 
                    excavation of many archeological sites in the Texas Panhandle 
                    through the 1930s. </p>
                  <p class="text">The creation of <strong>Lake Fryer</strong> on Wolf Creek 
                    not far downstream from Buried City in 1938 undoubtedly destroyed 
                    many Plains Village houses. The area was not studied prior 
                    to its inundation.</p>
                  <p class="text">Following Moorehead's investigations, no archeological 
                    research was carried out along Wolf Creek until the mid-1960s 
                    when <strong>Tom Ellzey</strong>, who had been raised on Wolf Creek 
                    and was then a graduate student at the University of Texas, 
                    undertook to explore the Handley Ruin identified by Moorehead. 
                    Ellzey's investigations were conducted because of his interest 
                    in the area and increasing interest in anthropology and archeology 
                    as a profession. He also recorded several other sites in the 
                    immediate vicinity. No final report of Ellzey's investigations 
                    has ever been published. </p>
                  <p><span class="text"><strong>Sam Handley</strong> (who sometimes spelled 
                    his name Handly) had owned the Buried City since the early 
                    part of the nineteen-teens. During the past few decades of 
                    his life (1950s and 1960s), Handley opened his ranch on Wolf 
                    Creek to the public. For a small daily fee, local people could 
                    come picnic, fish, and hunt or dig for artifacts. As a result, 
                    virtually all of the house ruins obvious on the surface were 
                    dug into repeatedly and many artifacts were removed. </span></p>
                  <p><span class="text">In the early 1980s Perryton resident and 
                    oil man <strong>Harold Courson</strong> purchased the old Handley Ranch, 
                    including the Buried City and related archeological sites, 
                    from the estate of Sam Handley. One of the reasons Courson 
                    purchased the property was that he knew of its significance 
                    and the local awareness of its importance and, paraphrasing 
                    his own words, he wanted to give something back to the county 
                    that had given so much to him. Harold Courson and son <strong>L. Kirk 
                    Courson</strong> devised a development plan for the ranch's livestock, 
                    renovation of its historic structures, and archeological investigation.</span> 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1985, Kirk Courson called archeologist <strong>David Hughes</strong> (author of this exhibit) to inquire about salvaging two Buried 
                    City sites that were rapidly eroding into Wolf Creek on the 
                    newly acquired ranch. (Each of the major concentrations of 
                    ruins are now considered separate sites.) Hughes began investigation 
                    of sites, dubbed Courson A and Courson B, in the summer of 
                    1985 with a small professional crew supplemented by Perryton 
                    High School students. Because of the size of the effort and 
                    the potential remaining in Buried City studies, the Courson 
                    family invited Hughes back in 1986 and a more comprehensive 
                    investigation was begun to complete the work at Courson B and 
                    expose the house at Kit Courson, a third locality. </p>
                  <p class="text">Because of public interest and the archeological 
                    potential discovered in these heavily disturbed sites, the 
                    Courson family and Hughes invited the <strong>Texas Archeological 
                    Society </strong>(TAS) to hold their field school at the Buried City 
                    in 1987 and 1988. Hundreds of volunteers from all over Texas 
                    and many surrounding states came to the Wolf Creek Valley 
                    to help secure information about this unique archeological 
                    area. TAS investigations completed the work at Courson A, 
                    Courson B, the Kit Courson Site, two additional localities, 
                    Courson C and Courson D, and began new explorations of &quot;Eyerly's 
                    Temple,&quot; the structure Moorehead called the Gould Ruin. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The final major field season Hughes directed 
                    was in the summer of 1990 when <strong>Wichita State University</strong>                    held a 3-month field school to complete preliminary evaluation 
                    of the unusual Eyerly's Temple in the original Buried City 
                    site area. </p>
                  <p class="text">Analysis of these findings and preparation of 
                    the reports is continuing under the direction of Hughes at 
                    Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas. When all analysis 
                    is completed, all collections and photographs will be returned 
                    to the Courson family who plans to make the information available 
                    through a public museum and interpretation in the area. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 2000, a new round of investigations at Buried 
                    City began under the direction of <strong>Scott Brosowske</strong>, 
                    a Ph.D. student at the University of Oklahoma. Brosowske was 
                    invited by the Courson family to carry out geophysical survey 
                    work along Wolf Creek to search for buried structural remains. 
                    A consulting firm, Archaeophysics LLC, carried out the survey 
                    using several different sensing devices including a soil resistance 
                    meter, a gradiometer, and a ground penetrating radar. Each of these devices detects anomalies 
                    (irregularities) in the soil such as those caused by the excavation 
                    of pits, fired surfaces, and buried rock alignments. Among 
                    the numerous anomalies were many the team thought were likely 
                    the signatures of cultural patterns, such as trash pits and 
                    pithouses. </p>
                  <p class="text">The following year (2001), Brosowske, aided 
                    by avocational archeologists, began to &quot;ground truth&quot; 
                    the geophysical data, meaning they began to sink test pits 
                    in and around the anomalies they felt were most promising. 
                    The initial results were very encouraging, but the need  for more extensive excavation was 
                    obvious. So in the summer of 
                    2003, Brosowske and fellow University of Oklahoma archeologist 
                    <strong>Susan C. Vehik</strong> returned to the area with an archeological 
                    field school aided again by volunteer archeologists. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Oklahoma team excavated two areas and in 
                    both cases came down on deeply buried pithouses that look 
                    very different from the stone-based houses built on the surface 
                    that are considered typical of Buried City. The analysis is 
                    just beginning, but the artifact assemblage seems to be very 
                    similar to that found in the stone-based houses. In other words, 
                    Plains Villagers were also living in pithouses. It is not 
                    yet known whether, as Brosowske suspects, some of the pithouses 
                    date a century or two earlier than the stone-based houses. 
                    But what is obvious is that the history of the Buried City 
                    settlement is much more complex and interesting than has been 
                    known for almost a century. </p>
