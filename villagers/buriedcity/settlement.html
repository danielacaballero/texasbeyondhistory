                  <p class="text">Buried City proper is part of a dense settlement 
                    zone along Wolf Creek that spans the space from the upstream 
                    exposure of the Ogallala formation to the place where the 
                    valley widens out, and springs from the Ogallala vanish into 
                    the deep sands of the valley floor. This is a distance of 
                    somewhat less than five miles along a valley that is less 
                    than one mile wide. The stone-based structures are distributed 
                    along the high terraces of this valley every 80 to 150 meters 
                    (87 to 163 yards) and are clustered in possible village arrangements. 
                    These village arrangements are called &quot;groups&quot; here, 
                    like the Buried City/Handley Ruins group, the Moorehead group, 
                    the Courson group, and the Kit Courson group. The nearest 
                    modern comparison would be to a rural subdivision with single 
                    family homes on 5 or 10 acre tracts. </p>
                  <p class="text">Buried City houses are not multiple-apartment 
                    dwellings intended to house a score or more of individuals 
                    as did the pueblos of the Southwest. They are not the very 
                    large earth lodges the Pawnee used to house large extended 
                    families. But they are substantial houses &#8212;  and large enough for 
                    small extended families of up to 20 people and spanning perhaps as many as three 
                    generations. The Kit Courson 
                    house measured about 8-x-10 meters (26-x-33 feet) with an interior floor 
                    space of about 63 square meters or 665 square feet (not counting 
                    the small alcove). This seems mighty small for 15 to 20 people 
                    by today's standards, but is consistent with what is known 
                    of village life in native America. </p>
                  <p class="text">No houses have been found on the floodplain 
                    or first terrace of Wolf Creek. All are located on more elevated 
                    terraces, probably for several obvious reasons. First and 
                    foremost is the need to avoid or lessen the hazard of the 
                    periodic flash floods that Texas Panhandle creeks and rivers 
                    are notorious for. It doesn't rain very often, but when it 
                    does it often comes down quickly and heavily. By locating 
                    the houses above but near the floodplain, Buried City dwellers 
                    would have been able to keep a close eye on horticultural 
                    fields as well as on the overall valley. Being below the caprock, 
                    the house locations would have had some natural shelter from 
                    winds and weather. A final pragmatic consideration might have 
                    been a desire to get above the &quot;bug zone.&quot; In wet 
                    times, the valley bottom along the creek would have been marshy 
                    and a good habitat for mosquitoes and gnats. </p>
                  <p class="text">In all, <strong>this short 5-mile stretch of the 
                    Wolf Creek Valley may have had 100 or more of the large prehistoric 
                    houses characteristic of the Buried City</strong>. There are other 
                    kinds of houses that did not have the stone foundations, 
                    such as pithouses, that are not included in this assessment 
                    of the settlement pattern. Some of these may date before the 
                    main Buried City settlement or they may be contemporaneous 
                    and represent a part of the settlement pattern that is not 
                    yet understood. The ongoing work by the University of Oklahoma 
                    promises to shed light on this problem.</p>
