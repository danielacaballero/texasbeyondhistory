                  <p class="text">In this section, we take a look at the characteristic 
                    Buried City architecture, particularly the large stone-based 
                    houses which have attracted attention for at least a century. 
                    Buried City architecture differs significantly from that known 
                    at other Plains Villager sites in the Texas Panhandle and 
                    adjacent areas. Until the Courson family sponsored a new series 
                    of excavations in 1985, archeologists had assumed that the 
                    Buried City houses were much like those of the better-studied 
                    Antelope Creek focus along the Canadian River. Our work showed 
                    that this assumption was only partially true. There are many 
                    houses and many different kinds of houses at the Buried City 
                    locality. They range from small scooped-out pithouses 2 to 
                    3 meters (6.5-10 feet) in diameter, to the recently discovered 
                    deep, circular pithouses, to surface houses with post walls 
                    and poorly prepared floors, to large, carefully planned, stone-based 
                    houses that are the hallmark of the Buried City complex. And 
                    then there is the misnamed &quot;temple.&quot;</p>
                  <p>
                  <h3>Construction and Layout of a Typical Buried City House</h3>
                  <p class="text">Based on the four large houses excavated in 
                    the 1980s, the typical Buried City house had a square to rectangular 
                    outline and measured about 7-9 meters (about 23-30 feet) on each side. The houses 
                    appear to have been constructed by the <strong>jacal technique</strong>, 
                    that is the walls were formed of closely spaced upright pickets, 
                    woven together with thin sticks/vines and then plastered over. 
                    But <strong>the walls are unusual in that they were double-pen 
                    walls</strong> with two parallel rows of pickets, which were anchored 
                    by caliche boulders and slabs, earth-filled, and plastered 
                    with mud. The roofs were most likely capped with a thick layer 
                    of grass thatch. The result was a sturdy, well-insulated house 
                    that provided protection from winter cold and summer heat 
                    (and possibly from raiders as well). </p>
                  <p class="text">House construction began with the excavation 
                    of a contiguous wall trench about 2-feet thick that outlined 
                    a rectangular area about 8 meters (26 feet) on a side. Small-diameter 
                    posts (pickets) were then set against both sides of the wall 
                    trench so as to form parallel rows about 2 feet apart. Next, 
                    the trench was backfilled to the level of the original soil 
                    and then capped with small to large caliche boulders and slabs 
                    of caliche placed between the rows of pickets. The boulders 
                    formed the lower core of the wall and acted to stabilize (anchor) 
                    the walls and keep the two sets of pickets from collapsing 
                    toward each other. Next the pickets were interwoven with flexible 
                    sticks (probably of plum, native grapevine, and willow) that 
                    ran along walls, essentially forming a pair of wickerwork 
                    fences about 20 inches (50 centimeters) apart. When these 
                    wall forms were finished, the prehistoric builders began excavations inside the house. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The bench areas along the north and west sides 
                    of the house were dug down a scant 10 centimeters (4 inches) 
                    below the original ground surface along the walls, and sloping 
                    deeper toward the center, eventually reaching a depth of about 
                    18 to 23 centimeters (7-9.5 inches). Between the benches, 
                    a deeper central channel was dug as much as 50 centimeters 
                    (almost 20 inches) below the original ground surface. The 
                    inner edges of the benches were vertical and 20 to 28 centimeters 
                    (8.3-11 inches) high. The edges of the north and south benches 
                    were carefully plastered with caliche mud to form smoothly 
                    rounded edges, but lacked the raised lips that occur along 
                    the edges of the benches in many Antelope Creek Phase houses. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">If the earth dug from the interior of the house 
                    had been used to fill the double-pen picket walls, as seems 
                    likely, the amount of fill would have been enough to create 
                    an earth-filled wall about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) above the 
                    original ground surface. Inside the house four large posts 
                    about one foot in diameter and possibly six to eight feet 
                    tall were set into the channel against the benches to provide 
                    roof support. The roof support posts were probably topped 
                    by horizontal braces. Roof-support stringers would have run 
                    from the braces to the tops of the walls. The result would 
                    have been a square, flat-topped roof in the center of the house 
                    surrounded by a sloping roof. </p>
                  <p class="text">Little real evidence survived of what the roof 
                    may have been made of, but we have hints of two possibilities. 
                    The first is that the roof was a grass-thatch roof with white 
                    caliche plaster around a smoke-hole in the center, directly 
                    above the central fireplace. Chunks of burned plaster were 
                    found on the floor of several houses. Alternatively, the roof 
                    may have been covered by a layer of earth, possibly cut sod 
                    blocks. Only minimal evidence of burned earth was observed 
                    in the house ruins, leading us to suspect the roofs were made 
                    of grass.</p>

                  <h3>Life in the Kit Courson House </h3>
                  <p class="text">The Kit Courson house is the most thoroughly 
                    investigated Buried City house. A detailed model of the house 
                    was built by Danny Witt based on archeological documentation 
                    and comparative data from historic earth lodges in the Northern 
                    Plains. Although the Buried City houses may have had grass-thatch 
                    roofs instead of being earth-covered and differed from Plains 
                    earth lodges in other important details, the basic layout 
                    and roof-framing may have been similar. Putting it all together&#151;documented 
                    details and supposition&#8212;we offer a sketch of life in the 
                    Kit Courson house (drawing on details from other Buried City 
                    houses as well).</p>
                  <p class="text">The villagers would have entered the house from the east via an <strong>extended 
                    entryway</strong> (slightly sloping down into the house), possibly 
                    a crawl-way that was lined with posts and covered like the 
                    house roof. The narrow entranceway minimized the amount of 
                    snow and cold air that entered the house. Near the entrance, 
                    but outside the house was a smaller, perhaps <strong>semi-attached 
                    room</strong> on the southeast corner that had apparently been 
                    added after the main house was built. This added room may 
                    have served special purposes such as that of a menstrual room 
                    or perhaps a mother-in-law's room. The houses of several Plains 
                    Indian groups are known to have had such features.</p>
                  <p class="text">Between the entryway and the attached room was 
                    a <strong>food processing and work area</strong> where in good weather 
                    people would have performed routine tasks like food preparation, 
                    tool maintenance and repair, and other daily functions. (In this 
                    area, archeologists found many deer-antler tool handles and flint-knapping 
                    tools, a deer-jaw sickle for cutting grass, grinding stones, 
                    and large fragments of pottery.) Weather permitting, most daily 
                    activities and work probably took place outside the house. 
                    When the north wind was blowing, outside work likely was done on the 
                    leeward (protected) side of the structure or in sheltered nooks like that 
                    created by the room addition and the entryway wall. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Entering the house, you would have stepped 
                    over a small <strong>raised sill</strong> at the bottom of the entranceway. 
                    When inside the house, proper, you would have been standing 
                    in the <strong>central channel</strong>, the lowest floor level. The 
                    sill you stepped over may have served two purposes; it probably 
                    keep water from seeping into the room from the entranceway 
                    and it would have been a stop for an entryway <strong>flap 
                    door</strong>, probably made of bison hide. Such a flap door would 
                    have been needed in the winter to trap cold air and keep it 
                    from entering the room. Interestingly, just inside several 
                    houses in the southeast corner of central channel, we have 
                    found several smooth rounded stones, sometimes fragments of 
                    grinding stones. Jack Hughes thought these served as weights 
                    for the entryway flap door. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the center of the central channel (which 
                    is also the center of the house) was a <strong>fireplace</strong> or 
                    hearth confined within a raised ring of plaster. Smoke from 
                    fires would have exited through a hole in the roof that was 
                    probably lined with plaster to guard against an accidental 
                    fire (a grass-thatched roof would have been highly flammable). 
                    Not surprisingly, numerous charcoal flecks are found in the 
                    center of the houses surrounding the fireplace, often embedded 
                    into the plaster. Other cooking-related detritus found in 
                    this area includes many small (&frac12;-inch diameter or so) 
                    fragments of pottery and small scraps of bone or mussel shell. 
                    In the center of the channel, south of the firepit in one 
                    house, we found a mid-portion of a buffalo rib lying against 
                    the bench margin. The rib was worn in such a way as to suggest 
                    it may have been used as a pot stirrer in food preparation. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Surrounding the central channel area are wide, 
                    low, elevated platforms or <strong>benches</strong> occupying the north 
                    and south thirds of the room and a narrower rear bench occupying 
                    the western one-third. At the intersection of all these thirds 
                    are the four massive posts, buried as much as 60 to 75 cm 
                    below the lowest surface of the living floor. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the front section of the house, the <strong>south 
                    bench</strong> and adjacent channel area was apparently an interior 
                    work area. At several other Buried City houses, we have found 
                    flint-knapping debris, broken grinding stones, and heavy compaction 
                    and wear on the floor. Most of the debris is in the central 
                    channel, although evidence of flint knapping occurs on the 
                    bench itself. In the Kit Courson house we found the sharp 
                    end of a flint knife embedded in the floor&#151;it looked 
                    like someone had plunged a knife into the floor and then snapped 
                    it off, leaving the broken end just below the plaster surface 
                    of the floor in this area. In the central channel adjacent 
                    was a large quantity of knapping debris from the same kind 
                    and color of chert. </p>
                  <p class="text">The front part of the <strong>north bench</strong> was 
                    consistently cleaner than the south bench but also had some 
                    minor knapping and bone debris (small fragments &frac12; to 
                    2 inches long, possibly from meal leftovers or bone tool manufacture). 
                    On the surface of the front-north bench areas we found fragments 
                    of charred food items, in one instance a small pit, possibly 
                    a storage pit, and occasional bits of pottery and tips of 
                    bone awls. </p>
                  <p class="text">In contrast to the front bench sections, the 
                    <strong>central bench </strong>sections on either side of the hearth 
                    near the center of the house are normally clean and artifact-free. 
                    In the houses where plaster is preserved, it is heavily worn 
                    in the central bench sections, suggesting much traffic. This 
                    is probably where people sat while cooking and eating and 
                    through which they passed when heading to the rear bench corners. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>rear benches</strong>, sometimes had greasy 
                    or burned areas about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter. 
                    This could be where small warming fires (or perhaps hot stones) 
                    were placed or perhaps the rotted remnants of a buffalo robe pile? 
                    This pattern was very obvious at the Courson B House. In general, 
                    the rear north and south benches (<strong>corner sections</strong>) 
                    of Buried City houses have never produced any artifacts on 
                    the plastered floor, and the plaster is normally well maintained 
                    with little or no wear. These corner sections are separated 
                    from the <strong>central rear bench</strong> by a shallow <strong>U-shaped 
                    channel </strong>that runs along the north and south margins of 
                    the rear bench and slopes from near the floor surface at the 
                    west end down to the level of the central channel abutting 
                    the main support post at that point. At the Courson B house 
                    we found unusually complete deer metapodial (ankle bone) awls, or weaving 
                    tools, in the channel that separates the rear bench from the 
                    north and south benches. It is not known whether these channels 
                    served a mundane function, such as  ventilation 
                    channels leading to small holes in the outside wall (possible 
                    indication of such was found in one house.) Alternatively, 
                    they could be dividers that set aside the central rear bench 
                    area as sacred space, where ritual paraphernalia was kept. 
                    The pattern designating the central west/rear section of houses 
                    as sacred space (often used for altars) was widespread among 
                    Plains Village groups. </p>
                  <h3>Architectural Variation </h3>
                  <p class="text">So far we've described only a single 
                    kind of house at Wolf Creek. These are the large, stone-based 
                    houses of about 64 square meters (689 square feet) enclosing 
                    a large single room that can be divided into several discrete 
                    areas based on apparent structural features (benches, channels, 
                    posts, etc.). Such houses are found in isolated locations, 
                    well separated from one another, and were probably built adjacent 
                    to one or more garden plots. These are the houses that most 
                    observers have noted and dug into, mainly because they are 
                    large and obvious. They appear to date in the middle to late 
                    14th century A.D. and are limited to a few miles along Wolf 
                    Creek, primarily on the south side of the creek. </p>
                  <p class="text">Other styles of structures have been identified 
                    during our studies and by the ongoing work by the University 
                    of Oklahoma. <strong>Four different house styles have been identified 
                    so far</strong>: single-post-wall structures, pit-houses or houses 
                    in pits, large single-room stone foundation houses, and one 
                    extremely large, multi-roomed, stone-based house. Design variation 
                    in the houses in a community is accepted as the norm 
                    today, yet archeologists seem to assume that, in the past, 
                    people made all their buildings in the same way in each area. 
                    Much of the variation we see along Wolf Creek may be simply 
                    the range of <strong>seasonal variation within a single community</strong>. 
                    Some structures may have been relatively light and porous 
                    for use in mild weather while others (the larger stone-based 
                    houses) were durable and resistant for use during inclement 
                    weather. The use of summer arbors and more substantial houses 
                    for winter is well documented by archeology and ethnohistory 
                    throughout the Southeastern U.S. It is, however, also possible 
                    that some of the variation seen along Wolf Creek may have 
                    developed over time; as more houses are excavated and dated, 
                    this idea can be evaluated. Regardless of what the source 
                    of the architectural variation may be, the differences are 
                    quite real. </p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>Courson A house</strong> shows the first variation 
                    in architectural style. It is a small house with walls made 
                    of a single row of posts, a central firepit, and two central 
                    support posts. The floor is irregular and lacks clear-cut 
                    evidence of plastering or smoothing. The entryway was probably 
                    to the southeast, although there was no obvious entranceway. 
                    Work areas associated with the house may have surrounded it, 
                    with a prominent work area west of the house, probably even 
                    then on or near the bluff overlooking Wolf Creek. This house 
                    was probably used in the mid to late 1200s. The finding of 
                    small pieces of stick-impressed daub suggests that the house's 
                    walls may have been constructed of wattle and daub: vertical 
                    posts set in the ground, then woven with thin limbs, vines, 
                    and other pliable substances, and then the whole thing plastered 
                    with a layer of mud. There were no rocks in the base of the 
                    walls. </p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>Courson B site</strong> contained a large 
                    typical Buried City house with stone-base walls that were underlain 
                    by two pits that had features reminiscent of pithouses. There 
                    were no obvious postholes associated with them, but their 
                    shallow basin form (about 2.5 meters in diameter) and 
                    a hearth in one, suggest they may have been small pithouses. Radiocarbon 
                    dates suggest the pithouses were in use during the early 1200s, 
                    slightly earlier than the overlying, large, stone-based house at Courson 
                    B. Both possible pithouses had been filled with trash and 
                    then after the passage of some time, the large stone-based 
                    house at Courson B was built over them. </p>
                  <p class="text">A third house style was also documented at Courson B,  a small square structure with no central channel, no 
                    formalized entry, and only a single line of postholes associated 
                    with a foundation of single rocks. No datable features (firepits, charred posts, etc.) 
                    were found in association with this structure, so we only know 
                    that it dates after the large stone-based house and pre-dates 
                    the terminal event at the site: a mass burial covered by a 
                    rock cairn burial. </p>
                  <h3>Eyerly's &quot;Temple&quot; </h3>
                  <p class="text">The most unusual and atypical &quot;house&quot; 
                    at the Buried City is the one Eyerly called the &quot;Temple&quot; 
                    and Moorehead labeled <strong>Gould Ruin</strong>. While it doesn't 
                    seem to have been a temple in any meaningful sense, Eyerly's 
                    Temple is almost three times the size of any other prehistoric 
                    structure along Wolf Creek. </p>
                  <p class="text">The basic dimensions of Eyerly's Temple have 
                    been known since the late 19th century: The long-axis of the 
                    structure is oriented 30&deg; east of north and extends for 
                    about 22 meters (72 feet). It was some 7-8 meters (23 to 26 
                    feet) wide (reports vary and some details were obscured or destroyed 
                    by repeated digging). Observations and opinions of the building 
                    varied, depending upon the observer and his prejudices. Eyerly 
                    suggested the structure was a burial mound. Moorehead defined 
                    it as a multiple-room structure with a central burial chamber. 
                    Our work in 1988-1990 confirmed neither of these, but produced 
                    a third alternative still and left us with far more questions 
                    than it did answers. </p>
                  <p class="text">Our work at Eyerly's Temple was limited largely 
                    to exploring the past archeological and less formal digs 
                    in the site and only secondarily allowed us an opportunity 
                    to investigate the prehistoric site and its contents. By clearing 
                    the disturbed matrix from previous excavations, tidying up 
                    the results, and doing some limited and partial exploration of the 
                    features previous workers didn't identify or explore, we hoped 
                    to gain insights into the structure while limiting our own 
                    damage. This limited objective was intentional since we will 
                    probably never see another Buried City building quite like 
                    Eyerly's Temple. </p>
                  <p class="text">In practice, our intended approach was difficult 
                    to accomplish because, even when records of past work existed, 
                    they didn't seem to accurately reflect the situation on the 
                    ground. T. L. Eyerly mentions only that his crew dug into this structure 
                    a little. Correspondence from Warren Moorehead to Fred Sterns suggests 
                    that Sterns spent some time excavating at the Temple but, 
                    without Sterns's notes and photographs, we do not know where 
                    he worked, how much he dug, or what he recovered. Franklin 
                    mentioned doing &quot;some work&quot; there, but didn't provide 
                    any maps or photographs showing exactly what he did. </p>
                  <p class="text">With Moorehead's work in 1920 we are on somewhat 
                    firmer ground, as he published sketches of his work in 1920 
                    and there are some photographs. Moorehead noted that he paid 
                    Sam Handley to backfill the excavations at the end of the 
                    season. During the 1990 season, we began to encounter bits 
                    of barbed wire intertwined with the rocks of the Temple and 
                    other puzzling occurances. Fortunately, a long-time local 
                    resident informed us that Handley did not backfill Moorehead's 
                    trenches, but had instead left them open for years so that 
                    the locals could see what they looked like. Handley used strands 
                    of barbed wire to keep the rocks from collapsing into the 
                    open trenches and, according to the informant, from time-to-time 
                    restacked the rocks after they had collapsed. </p>
                  <p class="text">Finally, there are some errors in the published 
                    record. Moorehead notes four openings or doorways in the west 
                    wall and five in the east wall and refers the reader to his 
                    Figures 32 and 34 for evidence. Close examination of these 
                    photographs shows them to be the same wall viewed from slightly 
                    different perspectives. Fortunately, we were able to secure 
                    a copy of Moorehead's original field notes from the Peabody 
                    Museum in Andover, Massachusetts and these plus other sources 
                    provided a somewhat better guide his work. </p>
                  <p class="text">The south wall of the Temple may have been destroyed 
                    before Moorehead arrived&#8212;he does not show firm rock alignments 
                    marking its position. Second, he notes at one point that near 
                    the south end &quot;of this [central to the ruin] trench we 
                    found a fragmentary bunched burial, down 20 inches&#8212;no skull 
                    and no large bones.&quot; His field notes discuss at length 
                    his difficulty in finding qualified labor and eventual decision 
                    to use a Fresno scraper and mule team (predecessor to the 
                    modern road grader) to excavate the trenches. This might explain 
                    the partial bundle burial containing only a upper torso and 
                    skull that we found in a similar location. Moorehead's expedient 
                    use of mechanical (or mule-powered!) excavation may have limited 
                    what he could observe in his excavations.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the 1988 and 1990 work, we found sufficient 
                    features to suggest that Moorehead's (and everyone else's) 
                    work did not finally reach the primary occupation floor of 
                    Eyerly's Temple except where the walls were trenched through 
                    the house floor. We were able to identify postmolds, storage 
                    and cache pits, firepits, and some other features from the 
                    prehistoric construction as well as numerous features from 
                    known and unknown historic excavators. </p>
                  <p class="text">The walls of the house appear to have been lined 
                    with posts set about 25 to 40 cm (10-15 inches) inside the 
                    stone facing of the wall. In the geometric center of the structure 
                    was a very large firepit almost 75 centimeters (30 inches) 
                    in diameter and about the same in depth. Flanking this firepit 
                    were six large postmolds that probably represent the primary 
                    roof support posts of the structure. In the center of the 
                    southern half of the house was a cylindrical firepit of about 
                    30 to 50 centimeters (12-20 inches) in diameter that was bracketed 
                    on the east and west by two postmolds 10 to 15 centimeters 
                    (4-6 inches) in diameter. Scattered throughout the building 
                    were the cylindrical trash or cache pits about a meter in 
                    diameter, which seem so characteristic of the Buried City. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Moorehead reported several openings in the east 
                    and west walls of the structure, but because of the extreme 
                    disturbance of the stone walls since Moorehead's work, we 
                    could neither confirm nor deny his observation. What openings 
                    we did find seemed to extend irregularly beyond the structure 
                    as though they represent &quot;pothole&quot; or informal excavation 
                    pits more than architectural elements. Along the east wall 
                    are three areas that might represent possible architectural 
                    openings. These seem to be aligned with the two confirmed 
                    firepits and possibly a third that Moorehead found. </p>
                  <p><span class="text"><strong>Eyerly's Temple represents the most 
                    unusual structure in the Buried City</strong>. Consider, however, 
                    that it seems to contain 3 fireplaces, 3 sets of center posts, 
                    and is roughly 3 times the size of the &quot;typical&quot; 
                    stone-based house. Perhaps the Temple was a large tripartite 
                    house, holding 2 or 3 families under a single roof with informal 
                    or light partition walls dividing the space into three units: 
                    north, central, and south. Since the central unit has a substantially 
                    larger hearth than the north or south, then perhaps it served 
                    as a community room for two related, extended families or lineages 
                    occupying the north and south areas. If complete excavation 
                    of the structure is ever undertaken, this hypothesis would 
                    certainly be worthy of exploration. </span></p>
                  <p class="text">Eyerly's Temple, like most Buried City structures, 
                    probably had a complicated history of use that we will never 
                    be able to fully sort out because of how it has been treated 
                    in historic times. The overlapping hearths show there were 
                    at least two occupational periods. But Eyerly surely thought 
                    it was a burial mound because he found burials in the upper, 
                    mounded part as it appeared in 1906. The mounded earth probably 
                    represents the decayed earth-filled upper walls and possibly 
                    the earth-covered roof of the &quot;big house.&quot; Thus, 
                    the burials Eyerly dug into were probably interred long after 
                    the big house had fallen into ruin, perhaps even centuries 
                    later by unrelated Native American peoples. </p>

                          The small depressed area where the tape measure is (see 
                          enlarged view) could be a food preparation area. In 
                          the upper left corner of the photo is a buffalo rib 
                          thought to have been used as a pot stirrer (see separate 
                          photo). Photo by David Hughes.</div>
