            <p class="text">Pottery making is one of the hallmarks of early village 
              life around the world, a technological development that allowed 
              the creation of cooking and storage containers out of mere mud and 
              fire. In the course of human history, ceramic technology&#151;the 
              use of heat to transform clay into an almost infinitely variable 
              material&#151;was a critically important achievement that led to 
              metallurgy, concrete, and, more recently, silicon chips. But the 
              adoption of ceramic technology began with a more modest step in 
              most areas of the world&#151;making simple earthenware pottery. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The basic process of making earthenware pottery was 
              much the same for people all across the world, but each group had 
              its own style and learned to use the clays and materials near at 
              hand. In this exhibit we focus on the particular raw materials, 
              techniques, and vessel forms typical of the Antelope Creek peoples 
              and their neighbors in and near the Texas Panhandle over 500 years 
              ago.</p>
            <h3><a name="borger"></a>Borger Cordmarked Pottery</h3>
            <p class="text">Around 900 years ago (A.D. 1100) the Plains villagers 
              who lived along the Canadian River in the Texas Panhandle developed 
              a distinctive style of earthenware pottery that archeologists today 
              call <strong>Borger Cordmarked</strong>. The pottery style is named for the town 
              of Borger, which overlooks the Canadian River valley in Hutchinson 
              County, an area where many Antelope Creek villages once stood. The 
              exterior surface of a cordmarked pot has hundreds of parallel indentations&#151;cord 
              impressions&#151;left by the use of a cord-wrapped paddle in concert 
              with an anvil stone. During pottery making, the small, rounded anvil 
              stone was held on the inside of a pottery vessel while the force 
              of the paddle on the outside compacted and shaped the clay wall 
              in between. This technique allowed the villagers to create globular 
              (shaped like a globe) cooking pots or jars about 1-foot high with 
              thin strong walls such as those shown here. These were ordinary 
              utilitarian vessels&#151;fire-proof cooking containers used to boil 
              and stew a variety of foods&#151;not fine wares intended for ritual 
              or trade.</p>
            <p class="text">Borger Cordmarked-style pottery is best known from 
              a 100-mile stretch of the Canadian River and its tributaries in 
              what is today the north-central part of the Texas Panhandle. It 
              was made between about A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1450 by the peoples known 
              to archeologists as the Antelope Creek culture. Very similar pottery 
              was also made by related Plains Village peoples living in southeastern 
              Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and the Oklahoma Panhandle. Their 
              pottery was a localized variety that was part of a widespread tradition 
              of making cordmarked earthenware shared by many of the villagers 
              of the southern and central Great Plains and their predecessors. 
              The earliest examples of cordmarked pottery in the region date to 
              the early centuries A.D. during the Plains Woodland period (ca. 
              A.D. 200-1100). Some of the latest examples come from historic Pawnee 
              sites along the Republican and Loop Rivers in Kansas and Nebraska 
              dating to the 1700s. </p>
            <p class="text">In North America, the technique of making cordmarked 
              pottery appears to have originated in the eastern U.S. prior to 
              1000 B.C. In the central part of the country, the cordmarked pottery 
              tradition occurs in the upper Midwest around 500 B.C. By the early 
              centuries A.D. pottery-making cultures were spreading westward up 
              the wooded lower valleys of the eastward-flowing tributaries of 
              the mighty Mississippi in what is today Missouri, eastern Kansas, 
              and eastern Oklahoma. From there, the Woodland peoples and their 
              cordmarked pottery tradition spread to the west and northwest up 
              the rivers and onto the Great Plains, including much of the Texas 
              Panhandle. During this period Plains Woodland peoples were experimenting 
              with agriculture and more settled life. The more sedentary lifestyle 
              allowed people to experiment with new technologies such as pottery 
              making. </p>
            <p class="text">The Woodland period cordmarked vessels were very large&#151;up 
              to 2 1/2-feet high&#151;and had thick walls and conical shapes (with 
              pointed bottoms like an inverted cone). These seem to have been 
              used primarily as storage containers and were quite serviceable; 
              however, they were prone to break and too heavy to haul very far. 
              Compared to storing food in underground storage pits, ceramic pots 
              must have been a big improvement.</p>
            <p class="text">The form of cordmarked pots evolved through time, 
              and by the Plains Village period (ca. A.D. 1100-1450) potters had 
              learned to make much better pottery that had strong, thin walls 
              and pleasingly round shapes. Functionally, the emphasis had changed 
              from storage to cooking vessels. The rounded thin-walled form with 
              a partially constricted opening provided a good trade-off between 
              volume and weight. Round-based pottery could be placed directly 
              on wood or dung fires and, if necessary, easily steadied with three 
              small stones. </p>
            <p class="text">Village potters experimented with different rim designs&#151;straight 
              rims, flared rims, and collared (thickened) rims&#151;and sometimes 
              added decorations such as incised lines and fingernail impressions 
              around the rim and neck. Localized variations across the southern 
              and central Plains show that different groups were developing their 
              own unique styles. For example, the Buried City villagers who lived 
              along Wolf Creek in what is today the northeast corner of the Texas 
              Panhandle often smoothed over the cordmarks and liked to decorate 
              their pots with incised lines, impressions, and punctations. They 
              also liked to use crushed scoria (red porous volcanic stone) and 
              sometimes bone for temper.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Why cordmarking?</strong> The paddle and anvil method 
              allows the potter to create strong, thin-walled vessels. Wrapping 
              the paddles with fiber cords prevents bone or wooden paddles from 
              sticking to the wet clay, the primary virtue of the technique from 
              a potter's perspective. The cordmarks created small, parallel ridges 
              that were oriented vertically and ran from the top of the vessel 
              through the midsection. The cordmarks on the lower body and base 
              overlap. The tiny ridges may have helped strengthen the characteristically 
              thin vessel walls&#151;often as thin as 2-4 mm (1/16 to 1/8 inch). 
              But the cordmarked surface was advantageous for two other reasons&#151;handling 
              and heating. </p>
            <p class="text">The rough surface of a cordmarked vessel provided 
              a good grip for what otherwise might have been a slippery vessel, 
              especially when buffalo bones were boiled to extract grease. This 
              messy process created black-sooted and stained cooking vessels&#151;the 
              Borger Cordmarked pottery found by archeologists is almost always 
              darker in color than the freshly made replicas shown in this section. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Cordmarking also creates more surface area and thus 
              allows more effective transfer of heat (energy) from a cooking fire 
              to the contents of the pot compared to a vessel with a smooth exterior. 
            </p>
            <h3><a name="learning"></a>Learning to Make Cordmarked Pottery </h3>
            <p class="text">About twenty years ago Panhandle native <strong>Alvin Lynn</strong> 
              set out to learn how Borger Cordmarked pottery was made from start 
              to finish. By doing so he hoped to gain insight into the lives of 
              the Antelope Creek villagers who once made this pottery. So he embarked 
              on his own program of &quot;experimental archeology&quot;&#151;replicating 
              the ancient technology using materials and tools that would have 
              been readily available. Below is a step-by-step guide to making 
              cordmarked pottery as developed by Lynn. But before we start, let's 
              meet the man.</p>
            <p class="text">Alvin Lynn was raised on a ranch and farm near Matador, 
              Texas, in the southeastern part of the Panhandle in the broken country 
              of the Rolling Plains. Early on he became fascinated with the land, 
              its rocks and its people, past and present. In college, he majored 
              in geology and history at West Texas State University at Canyon 
              and took classes from Dr. Jack Hughes. After college, he married 
              and became a high school science teacher in Dumas, Texas.</p>
            <p class="text">A wedding gift of black polished pottery from Santa 
              Clara Pueblo in north-central New Mexico inspired Alvin Lynn to 
              learn how to make pottery. He spent 10 years developing his skill 
              as a potter, studying with famed Santa Clara potters Barbara Naranjo 
              and Madelene Tafoya. Pottery making, he learned, was experimental 
              by nature and required a great deal of practice and experience to 
              perfect. Gradually he became an accomplished potter, making Southwestern-style 
              pottery which he gave to friends and sometimes sold. </p>
            <p class="text">Lynn became interested in learning how to replicate 
              Borger Cordmarked after he joined the Panhandle Archeological Society 
              and began volunteering on weekend archeological digs led by Hughes. 
              Pottery sherds were a common find, but no one seemed to know much 
              about how cordmarked pottery was made. So Lynn began carefully studying 
              pottery samples from Antelope Creek sites looking for clues. He 
              showed several partial Borger Cordmarked vessels to his teachers 
              at Santa Clara and they made several helpful suggestions as to how 
              he might proceed. The rest has been trial and error. </p>
            <p class="text">Over the last 20 years, Alvin Lynn has made dozens 
              of cordmarked pots and put on many pottery-making demonstrations 
              at museums, public schools, and archeological field schools. His 
              replicas are used by researchers and museums to help bring to life 
              the art and craft of pottery making. His work has been featured 
              in newspapers, magazines and TV shows.</p>

              and experience. The process begins with the gathering and preparation 
              of the raw materials and, for beginning potters, making a good set 
              of pottery-making tools. Material and tools in hand, the potter 
              carefully forms the vessel while the clay is wet and then allows 
              it to dry thoroughly. A week or so later, the pot is fired. If the 
              steps are followed properly and all goes well, the result is a well-fired 
              earthenware pot suitable for cooking and/or storage. </p>

            <p class="text">Borger Cordmarked, like virtually all earthenware 
              pottery, is made with three main ingredients&#151;clay, temper, 
              and water. </p>
            <p class="text">The Texas Panhandle is blessed with at least four 
              different geological formations that contain pure clay deposits 
              suitable for pottery making. Other secondary clay sources can be 
              found along the Canadian and its tributaries, but these clays are 
              often impure and more difficult to use. From oldest to youngest, 
              the main sources include the red clay of the Permian Redbeds, the 
              yellow to red clays of the Tecovas and Trujillo Triassic-age formations, 
              the brown to bluff clays of the Ogallala Pliocene-age formations, 
              and the dark gray and blue clays from the shallow playas dating 
              to the Pliocene and Pleistocene. All but the playa clays are exposed 
              in the canyon walls of the Canadian Breaks. While good pottery can 
              be made from all four sources, each clay has its own peculiar properties 
              and must be prepared somewhat differently. For instance, the Permian 
              red clay contains lots of salt and gypsum, minerals that often cause 
              pottery to explode or break apart during firing. Removing the mineral 
              inclusions is a tedious and time-consuming process. The younger 
              clays are easier to use and require less preparation.</p>
            <p class="text">For all the clays, the most dependable preparation 
              method is to dry the clay thoroughly and then pulverize it and carefully 
              search for rootlets, pebbles, and other impurities. Sometimes these 
              impurities are removed by screening or filtering after the clay 
              is rehydrated by adding water and allowed to sit overnight. Moist 
              clay is &quot;plastic&quot;&#151;easily shaped into almost any form, 
              but this plasticity comes at a cost. Pure clay may be too flexible 
              to hold its shape and it shrinks and cracks as it dries. Therefore, 
              &quot;temper&quot;&#151;nonplastic material such as sand, volcanic 
              ash, crushed rock, crushed pottery (grog), bone or shell&#151;is 
              often added. Without temper, clay forms flat platelets that tend 
              to trap and hold water; temper particles disrupt the clay platelets 
              and allow the walls of the vessel to dry more completely. Different 
              types of clay and different types of temper must be mixed at various 
              ratios to obtain a workable pottery clay. Typically the amount of 
              clay varies from 50-70% and the amount of temper from 30-50%. In 
              Borger Cordmarked pottery, micaceous sand and crushed quartzite 
              are the two most common tempers. </p>

            <p class="text">A potter, just like any craft specialist, needs a 
              good set of tools. The tools needed to make cordmarked pottery include 
              containers for gathering, carrying, and mixing the raw materials; 
              crushing tools for pulverizing clay and temper; and shaping tools 
              for working the wet clay. The shaping tools&#151;cord-wrapped paddles, 
              anvils, scrapers, and polishing stones&#151;were probably prized 
              possessions handed down from mother to daughter. </p>
            <p class="text">We don't know for certain that the prehistoric potters 
              during the village period were female, but this was very likely 
              the case based on early historic accounts from the Southwest and 
              the Plains. Men's and women's roles are dictated by custom in most 
              traditional societies. As Barbara Naranjo from Santa Clara Pueblo 
              teased: &quot;Men don't like to get their hands dirty.&quot; This 
              attitude has changed in recent decades as pottery making has become 
              a successful commercial venture for many Indian groups in the American 
              Southwest.</p>

            <p class="text">Careful examination of potsherds and partial vessels 
              found by archeologists at Plains Village period sites reveals many 
              clues as to how cordmarked pottery was made. Other clues come from 
              ethnographic accounts and plain old trial and error. While there 
              is more than one way to achieve similar results and many minor variations, 
              the process of cordmarked pottery making is now well understood.</p>
            <p class="text">Manufacture begins by forming the base of the pot 
              and letting it begin to dry. As it dries the base of the pot becomes 
              strong enough to hold the weight of added clay. The body of the 
              pot is formed by gradually adding rope-like clay coils one at a 
              time. These are shaped by hand and then welded into place with a 
              cord-wrapped paddle and anvil. Gradually smaller coils are added 
              until the &quot;neck&quot; is created, followed by a rim. Once the 
              rim is trimmed, the vessel is ready for decoration, if desired. 
              The completed &quot;greenware&quot; pot is allowed to dry for several 
              days or a week before it can be fired.</p>
            <p class="text">One step that is not shown below is using a mussel 
              shell scraper on the interior of the vessel to thin the walls. This 
              is done after paddling has mashed the coils together. Scraping removes 
              or obscures most of the anvil marks and results in thinner, more 
              even walls. Archeological examples of pottery with obvious anvil 
              marks show that scraping was not always done by prehistoric potters.</p>

                    final size and shape of the finished pot.</div>
