            <br><p class="text">Anyone who has ever lived in the Texas Panhandle knows 
              that the weather there can be harsh &#133; even downright nasty. 
              Springtime is plagued by constant winds, sometimes blowing 40 to 
              50 miles per hour, and severe thunderstorms spawning tornados and 
              hail. This is followed by a hot summer that may have day after day 
              of temperatures more than 100 degrees Farenheit. The fall is generally 
              mild, but winter can be especially bad. During a severe winter storm, 
              temperatures can drop below 0 degrees for days on end, and snow 
              accumulations of 8 to 10 inches can blow into drifts that are several 
              feet thick. The Panhandle town of Tulia shares the record for coldest 
              temperature ever recorded in Texas; a bone-chilling 23 degrees below 
              zero! No matter how you look at it, the typical weather in the Texas 
              Panhandle and throughout the Great Plains is volatile and unpredictable. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Prehistoric peoples who lived in the Southern Plains 
              faced these same conditions without many of the modern conveniences 
              we enjoy. We have mass-manufactured clothing and houses insulated 
              with space-age materials, along with central heating and cooling 
              provided by electricity or natural gas. Prehistoric peoples adapted 
              to the severe weather conditions by making use of the natural resources 
              and the &quot;primitive&quot; technology that they had. To cope 
              with the worst winter weather, for example, their choice of clothing, 
              where they would live, and the type of house they lived in were 
              each important. The choices they made could mean the difference 
              between life and death. </p>
            <p class="text">Prehistoric people on the Great Plains made warm clothes 
              out of the hides of animals they hunted, and buffalo hides made 
              especially warm winter robes and blankets. Their winter villages, 
              in deeply entrenched stream valleys that were better protected than 
              the flat plains, had good water, lots of wood for fuel in the fireplace, 
              and an abundance of plant and animal foods. Perhaps the most important 
              choice that prehistoric people made to cope with the cold winters 
              was the type of house they built. </p>
            <p class="text">Many animals on the plains, such as prairie dogs, 
              survive by burrowing into the ground. Many prehistoric peoples across 
              the Southern Plains, especially those who were farmers, did the 
              same thing and built houses that were dug into the ground. When 
              archeologists find and dig these dwellings, we call them <strong>pithouses</strong>. 
              The name is especially appropriate because the first stage of building 
              such a house was, quite literally, to dig a pit. A frame made of 
              wood logs and branches would be built, and then the earth dug out 
              of the pit was often used to make the roof. Another variation on 
              this theme was the <strong>earth lodge</strong>, which was dug only slightly 
              into the ground but built up to form an earthen dome.</p>
            <p class="text">Pithouses and earth lodges were very well suited for 
              the plains environment. These types of dwellings take advantage 
              of the natural insulation provided by the earth. Early pioneers 
              in the Texas Panhandle built dugouts that were very similar to prehistoric 
              pithouses. Even today, some residents of the Panhandle build underground 
              homes because they are energy efficient and protect people from 
              severe weather better than any above-ground dwelling. </p>
            <p class="text">This exhibit tells the story about one particular 
              prehistoric pithouse&#151;affectionately named <strong>Hank's house</strong>&#151;that 
              was found in Roberts County of the Texas Panhandle, about 160 miles 
              northeast of Amarillo. The site is on the M-Cross Ranch, owned by 
              rancher and writer John R. Erickson and his wife Kris. John has 
              written many books, but is famous for his more than 40 books in 
              the <em><strong>Hank the Cowdog</strong></em><strong> </strong>series. After discovering 
              a buried pithouse eroding out of the cutbank of an arroyo in July, 
              2000, John invited a group of archeologists to help him excavate 
              the ruins of this prehistoric dwelling in 2000 and 2001. They found 
              that this particular pithouse had burned and that its architectural 
              details were beautifully preserved. </p>
            <p class="text">This exhibit answers a series of questions relating 
              to Hank's house including: <em>How was Hank's house found and excavated? 
              What did it look like? How was the house built? When was the house 
              constructed and how long was it used? Why did the house burn? </em></p>
            <p class="text">The bigger question of Who were the people who lived 
              at Hank's house? is addressed in a companion exhibit <a href="../hank2/index.html" class="text">Hank's 
              House 2: A Puzzle Wrapped in a Mystery</a>.</p>
