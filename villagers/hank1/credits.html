            <p class="text">This exhibit was written by <strong>Douglas K. Boyd</strong>. 
              Doug was raised in the small town of Tulia in the Texas Panhandle. 
              He attended West Texas State University and took classes from Jack 
              Hughes and later earned his Masters degree at Texas A&amp;M. Since 
              1990 he has been a consulting archeologist for the Austin-based 
              firm Prewitt and Associates, Inc., where Boyd is now Vice President. 
              While his career has taken him all across Texas and beyond, the 
              prehistory of the Texas Panhandle remains his passion. </p>
            <p class="text">Special thanks go to <strong>John </strong>and<strong> 
              Kris Erickson</strong>, gracious hosts who allowed a bunch of archeologists 
              to spend time on their ranch and begin studying the many archeological 
              resources there. Although the work on their ranch has largely been 
              a volunteer effort, the Ericksons have financed many of the special 
              studies, including radiocarbon dates, provided food and lodging 
              for the archeologists, donated supplies, and assisted with travel 
              expenses.</p>
            <p class="text">TASN steward <strong>L. Douglas Wilkens</strong>, 
              of Perryton, Texas, worked long and hard on the Hank's site project. 
              Without his efforts, none of the work reported here could have been 
              accomplished. The company Doug works for, BP, provided him with 
              personal development funds that were put toward the logistical arrangements 
              for the field investigations at Hank's site.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Brett Cruse</strong>, Panhandle regional archeologist 
              for the Texas Historical Commission, provided assistance throughout 
              the planning, fieldwork, and analysis phases. His and the THC's 
              support of the archeological investigations in the West Pasture 
              are always welcome.</p>
            <p class="text">The following individuals volunteered their time for 
              the Hank's site excavations: Wes and Cindy Anderson, Doug Boyd, 
              Lance Brussard, Brett Cruse, John and Kris Erickson, Mark Erickson, 
              Mike Gilger, Mitch and Reba Jones, Alvin Lynn, Mark Mann, Teddy 
              Lou Stickney, Doug Wilkens, and Reggie Wiseman.</p>
            <p class="text">A grant from the Texas Archeological Society's Donors 
              Fund provided monies used for the macrobotanical studies by Dr. 
              Phil Dering of Texas A&amp;M University. A grant from the Friends 
              of the Texas Historical Commission's Curtis D.Tunnell Memorial Grant 
              Fund provided monies used to support the artifact cataloguing and 
              analyses, as well as to help with expenses related to producing 
              this web exhibit. </p>
            <p class="text">Finally, a personal note from Doug Boyd on the passing 
              of two prominent people in Panhandle archeology&#151;<strong>Reba 
              Jones</strong> and <strong>Jack Hughes</strong>. A long-time avocational 
              archeologist from Amarillo, Reba volunteered at the Hank's site 
              excavations with her husband, Mitch. This was just one of the many 
              times Reba donated her time and experience to an archeological endeavor. 
              The days she spent at Hank's site in November of 2000 were among 
              her last in the field, as she became ill soon afterwards. Reba passed 
              away in June of 2002, but her many contributions to Panhandle archeology 
              will long be remembered.</p>
            <p class="text">Jack &quot;dean of Panhandle archeology&quot; Hughes 
              died on May 13, 2001. Our team learned about his death while we 
              were finishing up the excavations at Hank's site. We talked about 
              Jack that night, and his many contributions to Panhandle archeology. 
              His archeological journey included almost half a century of work 
              in the region, and he had influenced many students and professional 
              and avocational archeologists along the way&#151;us included. Jack 
              was always a realist when it came to archeology, and I think he 
              would be the first to admit that all of us who have dabbled in Panhandle 
              archeology over the years are still a bunch of greenhorns with much 
              to learn!</p>

              <br> A <a href=https://www.ttupress.org/9781682831229/porch-talk/ target="_blank">book</a> aimed at school chilren was written by TBH Plains Village exhibit contributers John Erickson (author of the Hank the Cowdog book series) and archeologist Doug Boyd. When John Erickson saved up and purchased a tract of Panhandle property near Perryton, it set off a chain of discovery. Who lived in Texas over a thousand years ago? In <em>Porch Talk</em>, John Erickson and his archaeologist friend Doug Boyd investigate this question while explaining the art and science of archaeology for middle school readers. The book also features some other real life Texas archeologists. Teachers will be interested in an associated Educator's Guide that has eight social studies lesson plans available! Find the book and free Educator's Guide at <a href=https://www.ttupress.org/9781682831229/porch-talk/ target="_blank">Texas Tech University Press</a> and the guide plus accompanying instructional videos through <a href=https://www.plainsarch.org/education target="_blank">Plains Archeological Research</a>.</p>
