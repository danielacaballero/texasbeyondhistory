            <p class="text">The M-Cross Ranch is located about 25 miles southeast 
              of Perryton, Texas, and just north of the Canadian River valley. 
              The northern portion of the ranch is on the flat, treeless expanse 
              of grassland known as the High Plains, but most of the ranch extends 
              down into the <strong>Canadian Breaks</strong>, a rugged landscape formed 
              by erosion. Over many hundreds of thousands of years, as the Canadian 
              River gradually cut its way through the layers of earth and rock, 
              it washed away untold billions of tons of sediment. The process 
              exposed the Ogallala formation and created numerous steep-walled 
              canyons. The Ogallala formation consists of various layers of gravels 
              and sands but is capped by a thick layer of hard caliche that forms 
              the <strong>caprock</strong> edge of the High Plains. Because this caliche 
              layer is more resistant to erosion than the underlying layers, it 
              also forms the rim of the canyons in the Canadian Breaks.</p>
            <p class="text">The geology of the area helps explain the natural 
              resources there. The <strong>Ogallala formation </strong>is buried under most 
              of the High Plains, from Texas up into Canada, and it is one of 
              the most important freshwater aquifers in the United States. An 
              aquifer is simply an underground pool of water trapped in the sediment. 
              As rainwater soaks down through the soil and through cracks in the 
              rocks, it begins to collect within certain layers deep underground. 
              These aquifer layers may contain billions of gallons of water. In 
              the twentieth century, technology allowed humans to pump water from 
              the <strong>Ogallala aquifer </strong>all across the High Plains, first with 
              windmills and later with modern gas or electric-powered pumps. Prehistoric 
              people couldn't dig deep wells to pump the water, but they didn't 
              have to because the water flows out naturally in many places, called 
              springs. Freshwater springs occur in deep canyons where erosion 
              has exposed much of the Ogalalla formation and the waters trapped 
              in the aquifer simply flow out of the porous lower layers. </p>
            <p class="text">The Texas Panhandle climate is called &quot;semi-arid,&quot; 
              meaning that it is pretty darn dry. The average precipitation on 
              the High Plains is about 18 inches a year, but the distribution 
              of rainfall is quite variable and unpredictable in any given year 
              and between years. Drought conditions&#151;periods when the amount 
              of rainfall is much less than average &#151;are common and may last 
              for a few months or several years. Water is a very important resource 
              for people who live there today, and this was true throughout prehistory. 
              Because of the many springs emerging in the canyons of the Canadian 
              River Breaks, this region was literally an oasis in an otherwise 
              near-desert environment. The springs and spring-fed creeks provided 
              abundant water in the canyons, and the water supported a wide range 
              of plant life. The abundant water and plant life, in turn, attracted 
              a diverse range of animals. Locations where abundant water, plants, 
              and animals were present have always attracted people, and the Canadian 
              River Breaks were no exception. Archeologists have found good evidence 
              that people have been visiting the breaks for at least 13,500 years. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The list of plants and animals available to prehistoric 
              peoples in the Canadian River Breaks is too long to present here, 
              but several important sources of food warrant mention. Certainly 
              people hunted, killed, and ate many types of birds, reptiles, fish, 
              mussels, amphibians, and small mammals (such as rabbits, rodents, 
              and prairie dogs), but the three largest mammals&#151;buffalo, deer, 
              and antelope&#151;were the most important sources of meat and also 
              of hides. The buffalo was especially important because one animal 
              could provide many hundreds of pounds of meat. The list of wild 
              plant foods that were probably used is even more extensive. Some 
              of the more important plant foods were mesquite beans, fruits and 
              pads of prickly pear and other cacti, leaves and seeds of various 
              grasses and forbs (such as sunflower, chenopodium, and amaranth), 
              grapes and plums, yucca roots and flower petals, shin oak acorns, 
              and hackberry seeds. Relatively speaking, the Canadian River Breaks 
              was rich in resources. The late Jack T. Hughes (former professor 
              of anthropology at West Texas State University) used to say that 
              the canyonlands of the Texas Panhandle were a grocery store of resources 
              if you knew how to shop there. </p>
            <p class="text">Hank's site is located about five miles north of the 
              Canadian River, tucked away in a beautiful canyon near the head 
              of a spring-fed tributary. John Erickson calls this canyon the &quot;West 
              Pasture,&quot; and the main spring along this canyon is called Indian 
              Springs. This spring still flows today, but it is only a trickle 
              compared to what it would have been in prehistoric times long before 
              modern gas-powered engines were used to pump water out of the Ogallala 
              aquifer in the twentieth century. Prehistoric people were drawn 
              to the West Pasture valley because of the abundant fresh water and 
              the plants and animals available there.</p>
            <p class="text">Several archeologists have been working with <strong>John 
              Erickson</strong> to learn more about the archeological sites on 
              the M-Cross ranch. <strong>Doug Wilkens</strong>, a resident of Perryton, 
              Texas and a Panhandle regional steward with the Texas Historical 
              Commission's Texas Archeological Stewardship Network (TASN), began 
              doing archeological studies on the ranch in the early 1990s. The 
              TASN is a network of dedicated volunteer archeologists who work 
              with people in their own area to promote protection, preservation, 
              and documentation of archeological sites and information. Wilkens 
              is extremely knowledgeable in the archeology of his region and an 
              important advocate for why scientific archeology is far more meaningful 
              than simply collecting artifacts. Over a period of several years, 
              Wilkens and Erickson surveyed many parts of the ranch, recorded 
              dozens of sites including many large and important village sites 
              in the West Pasture, and conducted test excavations at some of the 
              sites. Wilkens and Erickson also enticed two other individuals to 
              become involved with the archeological research on the M-Cross. 
              One is <strong>Brett Cruse</strong>, an archeologist with the Texas Historical 
              Commission who directs the TASN program for the Texas Panhandle 
              region. The other is me, <strong>Doug Boyd</strong>, a vice president with 
              a cultural resources contracting firm in Austin, Texas. The one 
              thing that the four of us have in common is we all were born and 
              raised in the Texas Panhandle and have a deep appreciation for all 
              the people who lived there before us.</p>
