            <br><p class="text">Why did Hank's house burn? Burned houses are common 
              in many prehistoric sites of many different cultures, and they are 
              very common among some Southwestern and Plains groups. There are 
              many different reasons why a house might burn, such as: </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Accidental burning by natural causes</strong>&#151;a 
              wildfire spreads and sets a house on fire; </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Accidental burning by people</strong>&#151;a spark from 
              the fireplace ignites the roof, or an outdoor cooking fire gets 
              out of hand;</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Intentional burning by inhabitants</strong>&#151;an 
              abandoned lodge becomes old and dangerous and is intentionally torched;</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Intentional ritual burning by inhabitants</strong>&#151;the 
              lodge is burned as part of a mortuary ritual when someone who lived 
              in the house died;</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Intentional burning by others</strong>&#151;enemies 
              attack the village and set fire to the houses.</p>
            <p class="text"> Archeologists have seen evidence of all of these 
              causes at different sites in the Southwest and Great Plains, and 
              there are often clues as to why a house burned. An attack by an 
              enemy group, for example, may be a likely explanation for burned 
              houses if bodies are found within the house or if there is good 
              evidence that violence played a role at that particular time and 
              place. In other cases, archeologists have speculated about the cause 
              of house burning based on the artifacts found inside. A house full 
              of useful tools and complete pots could have been burned accidentally 
              with peoples' possessions left in them. Alternatively, some houses 
              are relatively clean, with few or no artifacts found in them. Such 
              houses appear to have been abandoned before being burned.</p>
            <p class="text">The Upper Republican culture in southern Nebraska 
              is one example where houses may have been burned intentionally on 
              a regular basis. Like the Plains villagers who lived in the Texas 
              Panhandle, these people were buffalo-hunting farmers who built earth 
              lodges. This culture is contemporaneous with some of the Plains 
              Village period in the Texas Panhandle, and some of their houses 
              were similar to Hank's house in layout, but they were usually a 
              little larger. The frequency of burned lodges in some of the Upper 
              Republican sites is so high that archeologist Donna Roper of Kansas 
              State University suggests that these people were deliberately burning 
              old and dilapidated houses.</p>
            <p class="text">It seems likely that Hank's house is another case 
              of burning an abandoned house, and the burning may have been intentional. 
              Several lines of evidence come into play for interpreting this. 
              First, if the house burned accidentally, then many of the peoples' 
              belongings might have been left inside and burned with the house. 
              There were few artifacts found directly on the house floor, and 
              most were unusable flakes or potsherds that were trampled into the 
              floor. The small cache of tools found along the south wall represents 
              relatively unimportant, or at least easily replaceable, items.</p>
            <p class="text">If Hank's house was burned intentionally after it 
              was abandoned, another important question comes to mind. <strong>How 
              long was the house used?</strong> Archeologists and anthropologists have 
              spent lots of time studying the &quot;longevity&quot; of various 
              types of houses among cultures around the world. They are always 
              interested in knowing how long a particular kind of house will last 
              and remain habitable after it is built. The biggest factors in determining 
              the longevity of simple houses are: (1) the location and setting 
              of the house; (2) the type of foundation used; (3) the nature of 
              the soil/substrate; and (4) the materials used in constructing the 
              walls and roof. Both pithouses and earth lodges required regular 
              maintenance to keep them in tip-top shape, and a well-maintained 
              house would certainly have lasted longer than one that was neglected. 
              At Hank's house, all of the juniper roof support and wall posts 
              were set directly into the ground and would have been subjected 
              to slow deterioration due to wetting/drying and insects. If Hank's 
              house were an earth lodge with a heavy earthen roof, one can easily 
              see that big problems would eventually arise when the posts became 
              too weak to support the weight of the roof.</p>
            <p class="text">Archeological studies, ethnographic accounts, and 
              house building experiments in the Great Plains and Southwest suggest 
              a pithouse dwelling similar to Hank's house would last somewhere 
              between 7 and 15 years. In extraordinary circumstances, a pithouse 
              might last as many as 25 years. This amount of variability should 
              be expected because of the many variables that contribute to the 
              longevity of a house. Hidatsa earth lodges, which were much larger 
              than Hank's house, are said to have generally lasted between 7 and 
              10 years. The owners could tell when the lodge was getting close 
              to retirement because the below-ground parts of the posts would 
              rot causing the roof to settle and sag. Because of the large heavy 
              roofs, it would have been difficult to replace the key support posts 
              once they began to rot. Since Hank's house was much smaller and 
              probably had experienced at least one post replacement  (described above in archeology of Hank's house and site), it is reasonable to assume 
              that it could have lasted longer than a large earth lodge. Based 
              on comparisons with longevity estimates for Southwestern pithouses, 
              it is likely that Hank's house was occupied for about 15 years, 
              plus or minus 5 years.</p>
