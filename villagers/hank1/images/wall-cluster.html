      found on the floor of Hank's house against the south wall is tentatively 
      interpreted as a potter's tool kit. Each of the items would have been useful 
      for making cordmarked pottery. The pebbles could have been used as anvils 
      held against the inside of a vessel during manufacture as the potter pressed 
      against the outside with the cord-wrapped paddle. The bone tools could have 
      been used to make punctations or engravings on the surface of the vessel. 
      The flake tool could have been used to cut the vessel rim. Several of the 
      mussel shell fragments have cut/smoothed edges and may have been used as 
      pottery scraping tools. <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
