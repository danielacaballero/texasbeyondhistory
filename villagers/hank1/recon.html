                          and it lasts longer before rotting than cottonwood and

                  <p class="text">Once the preserved half of Hank's house was 
                    excavated, we began trying to reconstruct how the whole house 
                    might have looked. Although, of course, we will never know 
                    for certain what the missing half of the house looked like, 
                    many prehistoric Plains Village houses have been excavated 
                    in the Texas Panhandle and the Southern Plains. Almost all 
                    the houses that look similar to Hank's house are very symmetrical. 
                    Thus, we assume that the north half was a mirror image of 
                    the south half. Granted this assumption and the preserved 
                    facts, the full house was rectangular with its long axis oriented 
                    east-west and its entrance facing east. The dimensions (length 
                    x width) and interior floor space of the house were 6 meters 
                    (19 feet, 8 inches) east-west by 5.6 meters (18 feet, 4 inches) 
                    and had a total area of 33.6 square meters (362 square feet). 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Accurate measurements of the depths of all postholes 
                    (from the house floor level) were made, and accurate measurements 
                    of the maximum post diameters were made for all of the charred 
                    posts. When no charred wood was found, it was still possible 
                    to estimate the approximate width or diameter of the post 
                    based on a comparison with the charred posts on the west wall. 
                    Because the postholes along the south and east walls were 
                    approximately the same diameters and depths as those on the 
                    west wall, it is fair to assume that the posts in these holes 
                    were in the same size range too. When the sizes and depths 
                    of all of the posts and postholes are compared, it reveals 
                    some interesting things about how Hank's house was built. 
                    (See <a href="images/postdim.html" target="_blank" class="text">Post 
                    Dimension Table</a>).</p>
                  <p class="text">It is safe to assume that the posts that were 
                    structurally most important were larger and set deeper in 
                    the ground because they had to hold up the most weight. As 
                    might be expected, then, the two central posts that held up 
                    the main central frame in the center of the house were much 
                    larger (diameter = 15 centimeters or 6 inches) than all of 
                    the other posts and were set deeply in the ground (average 
                    depth = 57 centimeters or 22.5 inches). In contrast, the posts 
                    along the walls were smaller (average diameter = 8.75 centimeters 
                    or 3.6 inches), more variable in size, and were all set less 
                    that 43 centimeters (17 inches) into the ground. </p>
                  <p class="text">Careful excavation of the charred posts and 
                    postholes along the west wall, along with detailed observations, 
                    led to another conclusion about house construction. All six 
                    of the posts that were set into postholes below the floor 
                    level were leaning inward toward the center of the house. 
                    Measurements of the angles of the charred posts and postholes 
                    revealed that all of the posts were leaning slightly eastward 
                    ranging from 11.5 to 17.5 degrees off of vertical. When all 
                    of the angles were averaged, it shows that the west wall of 
                    the house leaned inward about 14 degrees. </p>

                    a large (26-x-18 feet) rectangular dwelling that was excavated 
                    at this Hutchinson County site (41HC30), an unidentified artist

                    may date to about A.D. 1300. It shows walls consisting of 
                    vertical rock slabs and mud (or adobe), with a high roof covered 
                    in thatch (grass). Evidence of burned grass and brush was 
                    found in this house. Like Hank&#8217;s site, this site was 
                    also named for a canine, and the unnamed &#8220;black dog&#8221; 
                    is shown in the picture.</div></td>
                <td valign="top" width="372"><p class="text">Based on all of the architectural details described 
              above, two different reconstruction scenarios may be formulated 
              for Hank's house. Both are the same except for the type of roof. 
              Hank's house may have had a grass-covered roof, in which case it 
              must have been quite tall so that its roof was steep enough for 
              water to run off and not collect in the grass layer. The alternative 
              is that the roof was lower and had a layer of earth covering over 
              the layer of grass. Such houses are called earth lodges and were 
              a common form of house among the Plains Indian peoples in the central 
              and northern Plains. </p>
                  <p class="text">Several lines of evidence suggest that Hank's 
                    house was an earth lodge rather than a grass house. The most 
                    important evidence is burned debris inside the house. Modern 
                    fire investigators look at the evidence in burned structures 
                    to determine when and where the fire started. Remembering 
                    that only the southern half of Hank's house survived, the 
                    southwest corner where the evidence of intensive burning was 
                    found suggests that the fire began in the back of the house 
                    or near the center, possibly the roof. The blaze probably 
                    caught quickly, but the house fire was abruptly snuffed out 
                    when the roof collapsed. If the roof had been made only of 
                    branches and straws&#151;all good fuel&#151;it would have 
                    continued to burn until the entire roof and the wooden portions 
                    of the walls were completely engulfed in flames. Conversely, 
                    if the roof had a substantial layer of earth on top of it 
                    when it collapsed, this would probably have covered over the 
                    burning debris when the roof collapsed and stopped the oxygen 
                    flow to inside the pit. This earth lodge scenario would explain 
                    why so many of the posts along the south and east wall were 
                    not burned. </p>
            <p class="text">A similar phenomenon has been suggested for burned 
              pithouses in the southwestern United States. In his 1986 book, <em>Prehistory 
              of the American Southwest</em>, famed archeologist Emil Haury observed 
              that of the 14 &quot;semi-subterranean&quot; houses at an Hohokam 
              site (Roosevelt 9:6) in Arizona:</p></td>

                  <div class="caption">Antelope Creek houses, as envisioned by 
                    Floyd Studer in this undated pencil drawing, closely resembled 
                    Pueblo architecture. While the lower wall and exterior details 
                    were based on archeological evidence, high adobe and rock 
                    walls, the flat roof, and the roof-top entrance were entirely 
                    conjectural. Studer went to considerable lengths to reinforce 
                    his notion of the &quot;Pueblo Culture of the Texas Panhandle.&quot;
