      <p class="text">Contrary to conventional wisdom and traditional histories, 
        <strong>the Texas Panhandle was not &quot;settled&quot; first in the late 1800s; 
        it was, in fact, settled first some 800-900 years ago by prehistoric Plains 
        villagers </strong>who left behind abundant and unmistakable evidence of their 
        sustained presence<strong>. </strong>The stone ruins of many once-thriving Indian 
        villages and hamlets can still be found today in the valleys and broken 
        terrain along the Canadian River and various other upper stretches of 
        tributaries of the Arkansas and Red rivers. <strong>Who were these people? How 
        did they live? Why did they leave? Where did they go? How do we know?</strong> </p>
      <p class="text">The villagers who lived in the Texas Panhandle 
        were part of a much larger pattern of semi-settled life 
        in the Great Plains known as the <strong>Plains Village tradition</strong>. 
        Between roughly A.D. 1100 and 1500, these now-ruined settlements 
        were home to Indian peoples who depended in part on a 
        combination of bison hunting and horticulture (gardening) 
        and staked out their home territories in what is today 
        the Texas Panhandle. Locally, the best-known Plains Village 
        tradition is the <strong>Antelope Creek culture</strong> 
        centered in the Canadian River Valley not far north and 
        northeast of Amarillo, Texas. Antelope Creek villagers 
        lived in substantial houses sometimes arranged in blocks 
        of rooms somewhat similar to small Southwestern pueblos. 
        They hunted buffalo and other game, collected many kinds 
        of wild plants, grew corn and other crops with simple 
        farming techniques, quarried local materials such as Alibates 
        flint, and otherwise settled the land and made it their 
        home for centuries.</p>
      <p class="text">The story of this remarkable culture has 
        never been fully told, however, and much of what has been 
        presented previously to the public is an outdated and 
        false caricature. Once dubbed the <strong>Texas Panhandle 
        Pueblo culture</strong>, the villagers were portrayed 
        as peaceful corn farmers and buffalo hunters sharing much 
        in common with the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest. 
        In contrast, the view today of the Antelope Creek and 
        related Plains villagers who lived in the Texas Panhandle 
        and adjacent areas of the Southern Plains is one of small-scale 
        societies competing with one another, sometimes violently, 
        and living a precarious existence in a land often inhospitable. 
        Climatic and ecological data suggest that prehistoric 
        corn farming in much of the region was, at best, a risky 
        endeavor&#151;hunting and gathering may have provided 
        the bulk of the diet. Repeated droughts and the arrival 
        of Apache groups from the northwest are thought to have 
        ended the first era of settled life in the Texas Panhandle 
        less than a century before the Coronado expedition entered 
        the region in 1541.</p>
      <p class="text">The historical relationships between the 
        prehistoric villagers of the Southern Plains (including 
        those in the Texas Panhandle) and specific historic and 
        modern Indian groups are poorly understood. Plains villagers 
        had abandoned much of western and southwestern parts of 
        the Southern Plains by A.D. 1500. <strong>Most archeologists 
        and historians who have studied the problem believe that 
        the ancient villagers were ancestral speakers of one or 
        several of the Northern Caddoan languages: Wichita, Pawnee, 
        Arikira, and Kitsai.</strong> That said, attempts to link 
        specific archeological cultures with specific historically 
        known groups have been tentative and speculative at best. 
        All of the Northern Caddoan groups migrated over hundreds 
        of miles during their known histories, a pattern that 
        had its roots thousands of years earlier. (See <a href="../tejas/fundamentals/languages.html" class="text">Caddoan 
        Languages and Peoples</a> to learn more.)</p>
      <p class="text"><strong>The Plains Villagers of the Texas Panhandle exhibits 
        are aimed at bringing the results of almost 100 years of research to the 
        public.</strong> The villagers who lived in the Texas Panhandle for over three 
        centuries represent a little-known part of the cultural heritage of Texas. 
        While their lives might seem completely different from ours today, they 
        lived in the same environment and faced many of the same challenges that 
        Panhandle residents today face. One word sums up a big problem then and 
        now. <strong> Water</strong>. Not enough of it, not enough of it when and where 
        it's needed, and not enough of it to sustain the agricultural practices 
        that people then and now would have preferred to follow. </p>
      <p class="text">Five exhibits focus on the theme &quot;Plains 
        Villagers of the Texas Panhandle.&quot; In the future 
        we hope to add additional exhibits that will help flesh 
        out the remarkable stories of a long-gone and all-but-forgotten 
        people, the first settlers of the Southern Plains.</p>

      <h3>Exhibit Support</H3>
      <p class="text">The development of the &quot;Plains Villagers of the Texas 
        Panhandle&quot; exhibits was supported by funding from the <strong>Texas 
        Preservation Trust Fund</strong> of the <strong>Texas Historical Commission</strong>, 
        the <strong>Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,</strong> the <strong>Harold 
        Courson family</strong>, the <strong>Texas Archeological Society</strong>, 
        and the <strong>Council of Texas Archeologists</strong>. The staff of 
        the <strong>Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum</strong> provided invaluable 
        access to the museum's collections and archives. Archeologists<strong> 
        Scott D. Brosowske</strong> and <strong>Pat Mercado-Allinger</strong> served as 
        outside (peer) reviewers for all of the exhibits. </p>
	
	<h3>NEW 2022 <em>Porch Talk: A Conversation About Archaeology in the Texas Panhandle</em></H3>
	<p>This <a href=https://www.ttupress.org/9781682831229/porch-talk/ target="_blank">book</a> aimed at school children and students of archeology was written by TBH Plains Village exhibit contributers John Erickson (author of the <em>Hank the Cowdog</em> book series) and archeologist Doug Boyd. When John Erickson saved up and purchased a tract of Panhandle property near Perryton, it set off a chain of discovery. Who lived in Texas over a thousand years ago? In <em>Porch Talk</em>, John Erickson and his archeologist friend Doug Boyd investigate this question while explaining the art and science of archeology for middle school readers. The book also features some other real life Texas archeologists. Teachers will be interested in an associated Educator's Guide that has eight social studies lesson plans available! Find the book and free Educator's Guide at <a href=https://www.ttupress.org/9781682831229/porch-talk/ target="_blank">Texas Tech University Press</a> and the guide plus accompanying instructional videos through <a href=https://www.plainsarch.org/education target="_blank">Plains Archeological Research</a>.</p>
