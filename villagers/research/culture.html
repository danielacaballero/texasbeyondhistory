                <p class="text">By the late 1920s <strong>Floyd V. Studer</strong> 
              controlled access to most of the known Plains Village sites in the 
              Texas Panhandle. How and why he did this is a part of the fascinating, 
              but little-known story of a larger-than-life man. Studer was an 
              explorer, promoter, civic leader, watchdog, and kingpin, a determined 
              man whose impact on the study of Plains Village sites in the Texas 
              Panhandle is hard to exaggerate. For over 50 years, from the first 
              excavation at Buried City through the early 1960s, Floyd Studer 
              had a strong hand in virtually all archeology done in the Texas 
              Panhandle. </p>
            <p class="text">Studer was bitten badly by the archeology bug as a 
              15-year-old student during the 1907 expedition to Buried City. Perhaps 
              it was really more of an exploration bug combined with natural curiosity 
              and the pride of a native son of the Panhandle. Regardless, from 
              that day onward Studer sought out any and all archeological sites 
              in the Texas Panhandle, especially the Plains Villager sites with 
              masonry ruins. He was also fascinated with the fossil bones of ancient 
              animals; in the early 20th century, archeology and paleontology 
              were seen as closely related studies&#8212;both involved exploration 
              and digging. Studer had no formal training in archeology, but as 
              he put it in 1955:</p>
                  <div align="left" class="timelinetext"> 
              <p>I have made of it a lifetime relief occupation. &#8230; For 45 
                years, whenever possible, I worked on those ruins&#8212;surveying, 
                mapping, photographing, digging. &#8230; While engaged in commercial 
                activities in Amarillo, this was my relaxation on weekends and 
                holidays. Every means of transportation made available in those 
                years was used&#8212;shanks&#8217; mare, horseback, buckboard, 
                motorcycle, Model T, later models&#8212;until finally the airplane 
                solved a lot of the problems. </p>
            </div>
                  
            <p class="text">As Studer explored the Panhandle, he developed an 
              extensive network of local contacts through personal, family, banking, 
              and insurance connections. In the 1920s he obtained &#8220;scientific 
              leases&#8221; from ranchers within the Canadian Valley that he believed 
              gave him the right to decide who could investigate the sites. In 
              part he was motivated by his sense of ownership&#8212;it was he 
              who found and recorded most of these sites and he regarded the Canadian 
              Breaks as his &quot;turf.&quot; Studer also clearly felt a strong 
              sense of stewardship&#8212;like Moorehead, Studer recognized that 
              many of the sites were threatened by casual artifact seekers, museum 
              collectors, and development. </p>
            <p class="text">Studer played an instrumental role in the <strong>Panhandle-Plains 
              Historical Society</strong> and the establishment and development 
              of the Society&#8217;s <strong>Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum 
              </strong>in Canyon, the first state museum in Texas. In 1931, two 
              years before the museum first opened to the public, Studer signed 
              over his scientific leases to the society and its fledgling museum 
              in exchange for a non-salaried appointment as the museum&#8217;s 
              Director of Archaeology and Paleontology. This volunteer post gave 
              him a headquarters and solidified his control of Panhandle archeology 
              and paleontology for the next two decades. The museum was closely 
              connected to West Texas State Teachers College (West Texas A&amp;M 
              University today) and it was Studer&#8217;s influence that led the 
              college to create a teaching position in paleontology and anthropology 
              in 1934. </p>

            <p class="text">In 1955, Studer stated that he had &#8220;located, 
              mapped, and fully recorded over 200 Indian sites,&#8221; a claim 
              that must be tempered by the realization that most of Studer&#8217;s 
              written records were cursory even by the standards of the day. He 
              did keep a master numbered list of 212 sites that would become the 
              basis for the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum&#8217;s site records 
              and that live on today in site names such as <strong>Alibates (Ruin) 
              28</strong> and <strong>Antelope Creek (Ruin) 22</strong>.</p>
                  
            <p class="text">Studer was famously secretive and kept much of what 
              he knew to himself. His regional map that <strong>Warren King Moorehead</strong> 
              published in 1931 was intentionally incomplete, an omission attributed 
              in the report to the need to protect the sites and the landowners 
              from unwanted visitors. Not noted is the fact that Studer deliberately 
              mislocated some of the sites. He promised that one day he would 
              publish a complete map and report on his survey work, but never 
              did so.</p>
                  
            <p class="text"> Studer's secrecy and desire to obtain scientific 
              leases seem to have been spurred by concern that professional archeologists 
              from outside the region would plunder the sites for their own museums 
              and institutions. This concern was well-founded. A.V. Kidder, the 
              leading American archeologist of the day, decried the unscrupulous 
              collection practices of some museums in his 1932 study, <em>Artifacts 
              of Pecos Pueblo</em>. </p>
            <p class="text">Studer's suspicious attitude about outside archeologists 
              was encouraged by Moorehead, perhaps because he himself felt slighted 
              by (and in competition with) university-affiliated researchers. 
              Studer always gave Moorehead credit as being his most important 
              influence and chief advisor. Nonetheless, Studer did correspond 
              with and cooperate with other archeologists, such as Alden Mason, 
              Ted Sayles, and Curry Holden. He allowed these men to dig at certain 
              of the largest village sites.</p>
                  
                  
            
                  
                  
            <p class="text">During the early to mid 1930s, Studer carried out 
              limited excavations at numerous sites, including <strong>Antelope 
              Creek 22</strong>, <strong>Alibates 28</strong>, and <strong>Coetas 
              Creek 55</strong>. He was assisted by various friends and members 
              of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society. Most of this work appears 
              to have been done sporadically on weekends and holidays. The excavation 
              and documentation methods were typical of the era, which is to say 
              they were rather haphazard by today's standards. Essentially, Studer 
              dug into and cleared obvious rooms, focusing on the major architectural 
              elements such as doorways, fireplaces, and walls. Rich middens (trash 
              heaps) and burials were the only features outside the ruined walls 
              that were noted. Only select artifacts were collected and most animal 
              bones and charred plant remains were routinely discarded. Studer 
              published several summary articles on his work in the 1930s, with 
              mention of select architectural details of certain rooms at certain 
              sites, but none of his excavations were ever fully reported.</p>
                  
            <p class="text">In the 1930s Studer also became a major civic leader 
              in Amarillo and held posts in many community organizations. Archeology 
              and the promotion of all things Panhandle remained his passion throughout 
              his life. He did not relinquish his position at the museum until 
              <strong>Jack Hughes</strong> was hired in 1952 to take over as curator 
              of archeology and paleontology. Studer remained an active member 
              of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society, served on its board 
              and held its highest elected offices in the mid to late 1950s. Toward 
              the end of his life he and Amarillo businessman <strong>Henry Hertner</strong> 
              initiated the local efforts that led to the creation of the <strong>Alibates 
              Flint Quarries National Monument</strong> in 1965. After Floyd Studer 
              died in 1966, his widow turned over his remaining archeological 
              records to Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum and the National Park 
              Service, the federal agency that administers Alibates. </p>
            <p class="text">One notable, but understandable, aspect of Studer&#8217;s 
              mindset was his insistence on viewing and interpreting the archeology 
              of the Plains villagers of the Texas Panhandle through a Southwestern 
              lens. He considered the Panhandle part of the American Southwest 
              and emphasized this in many ways. Although he would later claim 
              that it was Moorehead who coined the term &#8220;<strong>Texas Panhandle 
              Pueblo Culture</strong>,&#8221; it first appears in Studer&#8217;s 
              section of Moorehead&#8217;s 1931 report, and it was Studer who 
              continued to use the term for decades. In a separate 1931 article, 
              Studer described local ruins as &#8220;Post Basket Maker sites,&#8221; 
              again implying a close relationship to the Southwest. </p>
            <p class="text">In the 1930s, the American Southwest was, as it still 
              remains today, the best-known archeological region in the country. 
              The abundant masonry ruins, the excellent preservation conditions, 
              and the fact that numerous native peoples still lived there made 
              the Southwest a scientific Mecca. Because of the intense archeological 
              attention and the fact that many ruins had preserved timbers that 
              could be dated through dendrochronology (tree-ring dating), the 
              Southwest was also the only region that had a solid prehistoric 
              chronological framework. The tree-ring dates and the pottery sequence 
              developed by famed archeologist <strong>A.V. Kidder</strong> at 
              <strong>Pecos Pueblo</strong> resulted in the Pecos Classification of 1927. This 
              scheme was worked out by Kidder and the participants of the first 
              <strong>Pecos Conference</strong>, an annual meeting of the top 
              Southwestern archeologists. The proposed cultural stages/periods 
              known as <strong>Basketmaker I</strong> through <strong>III</strong>, 
              followed by <strong>Pueblo I</strong> through<strong> V</strong>, 
              became widely used throughout the Southwest and beyond.</p>
                  
            <p class="text">In the 1930s Studer attended several Pecos Conferences 
              and was influenced by what he learned, finding much more of interest 
              in the Southwest than he did in other areas of Texas. Studer had 
              dutifully written the reigning archeological authorities in Texas, 
              Abilene physician <strong>Cyrus Ray</strong> (lead founder of the 
              Texas Archeological Society) and professor <strong>J. E. Pearce</strong> 
              at the University of Texas, asking their advice on the architecture 
              he was exploring in the Panhandle. But neither offered Studer much 
              help because they were unfamiliar with the region and they did not 
              know of similar ruins elsewhere in Texas. Studer had better luck 
              when he wrote archeologist <strong>Frank C. Hibben</strong> at the 
              University of New Mexico. Hibben&#8217;s willingness to give Studer 
              guidance was probably one of the main reasons Studer adopted Southwestern 
              terminology. (Later, it was Hibben who suggested to Studer that 
              he hire a promising student, <strong>Ele Baker</strong>, to direct 
              WPA digs in the late 1930s.)</p>
                  
            <p class="text">Studer's strong belief in a Southwestern orientation 
              influenced Panhandle archeology in profound ways for many years, 
              but other researchers saw increasing indications to the contrary. 
              In his later years, Studer seems to have struggled to reconcile 
              his long-standing Southwestern bias with the mounting evidence that 
              his beloved Panhandle ruins were built by Plains Indians. Near the 
              end of a short 1955 review article, his last publication on the 
              subject, he wrote:</p>
                  
            <p class="timelinetext">The Texas Panhandle Pueblo Culture apparently 
              originated from the pottery-making people who appeared on the Central 
              Plains after 900 A.D., reaching the valley of the Canadian some 
              two or three centuries later.</p>

                  
            <p class="text">Yet, in the same article Studer attributed the origins 
              of the &#8220;first American apartment houses&#8221; (i.e., Antelope 
              Creek ruins) to the Southwest, an idea he never let go of. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Beginning in the early 1930s, Studer speculatively 
              identified what he felt were close architectural parallels between 
              the houses he and others excavated at Antelope Creek 22 and other 
              Panhandle sites with Southwestern Pueblos. Among these were what 
              he called ventilator shafts, stone deflectors, sipapus (symbolic 
              spirit holes), and kivas (underground ritual or assembly rooms). 
              Although there is little doubt that Antelope Creek villagers did 
              incorporate some broad architectural ideas from Southwestern peoples, 
              Studer consistently downplayed or ignored the equally compelling 
              architectural similarities with Plains Village sites up and down 
              the Plains. Studer&#8217;s Southwestern bias can still be seen today 
              in the scale model reconstruction of the Antelope Creek 22 ruin 
              that is on display at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum. Under 
              his direction, WPA workers reconstructed the site as a Southwestern 
              Pueblo complete with flat roofs, roof entries, and attached kivas. 
              Today few experts accept this reconstruction, because there is little 
              convincing evidence for the existence of kivas, sipapus, or flat 
              roofs with roof entries in Antelope Creek architecture. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Even so, Floyd Studer&#8217;s legacy lives on in the 
              Texas Panhandle in countless ways. He literally and figuratively 
              put the region on the nation&#8217;s archeological map. Throughout 
              his life he worked to protect the ruins left by the &#8220;Texas 
              Panhandle Pueblo Culture&#8221; and to call public and scholarly 
              attention to their importance. It was he who had the vision to tap 
              into the New Deal funding to develop archeological and paleontological 
              programs at the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, and he was largely 
              responsible for uniting the museum with the West Texas State Teachers 
              College. From this union he was able to hire C. S. Johnston and 
              Ele and Jewel Baker, and these people worked miracles in securing 
              funding for programs and rigorously documenting large-scale WPA 
              excavations. 
            <H3> New Deal Archeology</H3>
            
                  
            <p class="text">The 1930s was tough time in the Texas and Oklahoma 
              Panhandles. The entire country was mired in the Great Depression 
              that followed the 1929 stock market collapse. Simultaneously, a 
              prolonged drought (1931-1934) turned much of the Southern Plains 
              into a &#8220;<strong>dust bowl</strong>&#8221; and sent many farming 
              families to ruin (and to California). In response to the country&#8217;s 
              woes, the Federal government under Franklin D. Roosevelt created 
              an unprecedented series of relief programs known collectively as 
              the <strong>New Deal.</strong> Because the main goal was to put 
              people back to work, labor-intensive archeological and paleontological 
              projects were seen as effective ways to do just that. To land such 
              a project, a state or local institution, usually a university, had 
              to sponsor and administer the work. Through this process, the New 
              Deal resulted in massive archeological excavations in the Southern 
              Plains and many other areas of the country in the late 1930s and 
              early 1940s.</p>
                  
            <p class="text">A four-part series of articles recently published 
              in <em>Oklahoma Archeology</em> (the journal of the Oklahoma Anthropological 
              Society) tells the intriguing story of the New Deal work projects 
              carried out at the <strong>Stamper site</strong>, a large Plains 
              village along the Beaver River in Texas County in the Oklahoma Panhandle. 
              Trial excavations sponsored by the University of Oklahoma in 1933 
              led to funding from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration 
              (FERA) for major excavations carried out in 1934-1935 under the 
              direction of <strong>C. Stuart Johnston</strong> and then <strong>Fred 
              Carder</strong>. Their work showed the slab-house construction typical 
              of Antelope Creek sites was also present in the Oklahoma Panhandle. 
              FERA also supported Oklahoma Historical Society excavations at the 
              <strong>Roy Smith site</strong>, another slab-house ruin, near Turpin, 
              Oklahoma. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">In the fall of 1934, Johnston was hired away from Oklahoma 
              by the West Texas State Teachers College (WTSTC) in Canyon, Texas, 
              to teach geology and anthropology courses. Floyd Studer was almost 
              certainly responsible for Johnston's hire. Young, handsome, and brilliant, 
              C. Stuart Johnston soon became a popular teacher and an effective 
              administrator of WPA grants. He and his wife, <strong>Margaret Johnston</strong>, 
              11 years his junior, were the talk of the town. Using his Oklahoma 
              experience with FERA, Johnston successfully won federal funding for 
              a series of major paleontological surveys, digs, and fossil restoration 
              projects as well as archeological projects in the Texas Panhandle. 
              After mid-1935, the funding came from the <strong>Work Progress 
              (or Projects) Administration (WPA)</strong> for projects sponsored 
              by the college and the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society and headquartered 
              at the museum. </p>
            <p class="text">Stuart Johnston oversaw many WPA paleontological projects 
              over the next few years as well as several archeological projects. 
              Meanwhile he continued to teach and was under increasing pressure 
              to finish his dual Ph.D. in paleontology and anthropology at the 
              University of Oklahoma. Johnston had completed a paleontological 
              dissertation and for his anthropology degree he only needed to write 
              a publishable paper. To satisfy this requirement, he wrote a preliminary 
              report on the WPA work at Antelope Creek 22, but ran afoul of Floyd 
              Studer, whose permission he had failed to obtain. While Johnston 
              was the official scientific administrator of the WPA work, Floyd 
              Studer was the sponsor&#8217;s (WTSTC) representative in charge 
              of the archeological investigations and he was determined to maintain 
              his proprietary interests in the region. </p>
            <p class="text">Cracking under the pressure, Johnston fled to Boston 
              in the summer of 1939. Not long thereafter, he was found dead in 
              a Boston boarding house. Ironically, Studer had apparently relented. 
              Shortly after Johnston&#8217;s untimely demise, his article on Antelope 
              Creek 22 appeared in the 1939 <em>Bulletin of the Texas Archeological 
              and Paleontological Society</em>. </p>
            <p class="text">Despite Johnston's death, the WPA continued to fund 
              archeological investigations of eight of Studer&#8217;s Antelope 
              Creek sites. Under Studer&#8217;s supervision, the fieldwork was 
              directed by the husband and wife team of <strong>Ele</strong> <strong>and</strong> 
              <strong>Jewel Baker</strong>. Ele was the son of &#8220;<strong>Uncle 
              Billy Baker</strong>,&#8221; a Soil Conservation Service agent in 
              Cimarron County, Oklahoma, and avid amateur archeologist. Ele had 
              directed the 1934 FERA excavations at the <strong>Kenton Caves </strong>in 
              the Oklahoma panhandle before going to the University of New Mexico 
              to begin his undergraduate degree in archeology. While in New Mexico, 
              he participated in field schools run by Frank Hibben at Chaco Canyon 
              and Paako. Running low on money, Ele and Jewel ran <strong>Civilian 
              Conservation Corps (CCC)</strong> projects in northern New Mexico, 
              excavating and restoring two Spanish missions, <strong>Quarai</strong> and <strong>Jemez</strong>. 
            </p> 
                  
            <p class="text">Arriving in Texas in 1938, the Bakers proved to be 
              a capable and hard-working pair. Ele&#8217;s official title was 
              Project Superintendent, while Jewel served as Assistant Archaeologist 
              in charge of artifact handling and cataloguing (she also seems to 
              have excavated most of the burials). The field crew consisted of 
              20 laborers from the relief rolls of Potter County plus two professional 
              workers; three additional workers labored in the laboratory at the 
              museum. Early each morning the Bakers each drove a project truck 
              around Amarillo picking up WPA workers at their homes and then out 
              to the sites under excavation, returning late in the day. They also 
              scavenged building materials on these morning drives to construct 
              the field laboratory at Alibates Ruin 28 modeled after the Antelope 
              Creek houses they were digging. From 1938 to 1941, the WPA teams 
              carried out extensive excavations along Antelope Creek (Ruins 22, 
              22A, 23, 24), Alibates Creek (Ruins 28, 28A, 30), and Corral Creek 
              (Chimney Rock Ruin 51). </p>
               
                  
            <p class="text">Because of the Bakers' experience, their sizable workforce, 
              and procedures introduced by the WPA, the work was far more systematic 
              and better documented than previous archeological excavations in 
              the region. As they excavated and documented house after house at 
              site after site, the Bakers were able to see both consistent patterns 
              in architecture among Antelope Creek villages as well as lots of 
              variation.</p>
            <p class="text"> Following up on suggestions made by famed Plains 
              archeologist <strong>Waldo Wedel</strong>, the Bakers noted similarities 
              between the Canadian River sites and sites along the Republican 
              River in Nebraska. With the exception of building techniques and 
              the use of local resources, the material culture of the Antelope 
              Creek sites closely resembled that of Plains Village sites in the 
              Central Plains. The Bakers noted that the Stamper site (&#8220;a 
              single site of the same culture found near Guymon, Oklahoma&#8221;), 
              100 miles to the north, was the only other known locality where 
              Antelope Creek style architecture occurred. (Actually, several other 
              Oklahoma Panhandle sites, such as the Roy Smith site, were also 
              known to have similar architecture.) </p>
                  
            <p class="text">With World War II looming, WPA funding ended abruptly 
              in 1941. The Bakers were able to prepare the required quarterly 
              reports and complete two final WPA project reports on their work, 
              but these would remain unpublished for almost 60 years. The reports 
              contain careful descriptions of each room with sketch maps and tabulations 
              of artifact counts, but little real synthesis and interpretation. 
              Like so many WPA-funded archeological projects, the notes and collections 
              languished for decades in a half-finished state. Things became separated, 
              photographs and maps were neglected, and no one stepped in to take 
              on the onerous task of finishing the work and synthesizing the findings. 
            </p>
                  
            <p class="text">In the early 1940s, Studer wrote a formal report on 
              the Alibates sites (much of it taken from the Bakers' WPA reports) 
              and apparently hired ghost writers to write a report on the Antelope 
              Creek sites (also heavily dependent on the Bakers&#8217; work), 
              intending to publish these under his own name. Unfortunately, neither 
              report was published. Through the succeeding years, sections from 
              the WPA reports were disassembled&#8212;some portions of them ended 
              up in the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum and some went to the 
              National Park Service. In the 1980s, the WPA documents were reunited 
              by Chris Lintz during his dissertation research. Another positive 
              development is that the federal government through the National 
              Park Service has provided funding in recent decades to consolidate 
              and upgrade the WPA records and collections at the Panhandle-Plains 
              Historical Museum.</p>
