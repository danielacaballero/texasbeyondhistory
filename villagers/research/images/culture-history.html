      <h2>What is Culture History?</h2>
      <p class="text">For archeologists and anthropologists, culture history is 
        an analytical approach that seeks to describe past cultures and the things 
        those cultures created (&#8220;<strong>material culture</strong>&#8221;) 
        through historical time and across geographical space. </p>
      <p class="text">Culture historians begin by defining meaningful <strong>cultural 
        units</strong> (such as phases, cultures, and time periods) characterized 
        by distinctive sets of <strong>material traits</strong> (such as artifact 
        types, house types, foods, etc.) unique to a given area or region. Typically, 
        a two-dimensional &#8220;<strong>time-space grid</strong>&#8221; or <strong>chronological 
        chart</strong> is constructed that shows the basic relations between culture 
        units through time and across the region. This framework is an essential 
        organizing device, but it inevitably reduces and obscures cultural complexity 
        as any simple scheme must. </p>
      <p class="text">By studying the changes and differences in material traits 
        across the landscape and through historical time, the <strong>culture 
        historian</strong> hopes to understand at least the basic outline of the 
        historical development of the underlying cultures. The best culture historians 
        combine the skills of top-notch detectives, writers, and scientists; such 
        individuals are rare. In Texas, Alex D. Krieger had few peers. A more 
        recent example of an outstanding culture historian is LeRoy Johnson, Jr. 
      </p>
      <p class="text">As a formal approach, culture history fell out of academic 
        favor in the 1960s and 1970s because the rich descriptive details it produces 
        provide few satisfying explanations of <em><strong>why</strong></em> cultures 
        change and little understanding of the underlying <strong>processes</strong> 
        which cause cultures to change (or not). Nonetheless, today culture history 
        continues to provide the basic chronological and organizational framework 
        upon which most explanations of the human past depend.</p>
