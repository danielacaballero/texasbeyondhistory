      <p>Excavations underway in 1957 at the Roper site by the Norpan Archaeological 
        Society. The site was selected because it was in the immediate vicinity 
        of where construction on Sanford Dam would take place and because it appeared 
        to represent a fairly typical Antelope Creek hamlet with its cluster of 
        four circular houses. Although Jack Hughes was officially in charge of 
        the dig, he left the volunteer archeologists on their own most of the 
        time. Volunteers did the lion&#8217;s share of the archeology that was 
        done in the Canadian River Valley prior to the filling of Lake Meredith.
