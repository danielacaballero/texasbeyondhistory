      <h2>Who were the Mound Builders? </h2>
      <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the term &quot;Mound Builders&quot; 
        was applied to the prehistoric cultures in the Eastern United States who 
        had left behind the earthen mounds found in many places in the Midwest 
        and Southeast. The earthen mounds included burial mounds, platform mounds 
        (upon which temples or other structures were built), and some effigy mounds 
        built in the shape of an animal or bird. Today we know that these mounds 
        were created by many different cultures spanning thousands of years. But 
        in the mid-1800s, the mounds were seen as work of a single culture that 
        some thought could not possibly be the ancestors of American Indians. 
        Some were convinced that the mounds had been built by the Lost Tribe of 
        Israel. This ridiculous notion was abandoned by the late 1800s when the 
        discipline of archeology was established. Large numbers of Indian artifacts 
        found within the mounds showed that these were the work of Native American 
        cultures. Still, many simplistic notions persisted well into the 1900s 
        including the idea that a single Mound Builder culture had existed. <br>
