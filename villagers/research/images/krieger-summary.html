      <h2>Krieger's Summary of Antelope Creek</h2>
      <p class="text">The first area investigated was the northern Panhandle of 
        Texas. Here we found a most interesting situation regarding masonry structures 
        in the narrow corridor of the Canadian Valley. After reviewing and drawing 
        together various sources of information, an Antelope Creek Focus was defined 
        and related materials traced through other parts of the Panhandle, principally 
        on its eastern side, and in northeastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, 
        and the Oklahoma Panhandle. A southern and western boundary for cord-marked 
        utility pottery with various associated Plains artifacts was drawn (Map 
        1) and the term Panhandle Aspect proposed to include these remains; it 
        was suggested that other foci in addition to Antelope Creek would be defined 
        in the southern High Plains region. Comparisons were then made in the 
        artifacts of Antelope Creek Focus, Upper Republican Aspect in the central 
        Plains, and Pecos Pueblo in New Mexico, followed by a brief survey of 
        Southwestern architecture made in order to discover the possible origins 
        of Panhandle masonry. The principal results were that Antelope Creek Focus 
        was a Plains culture rather closely akin to Upper Republican in economic 
        life based jointly on maize agriculture and hunting of bison, etc., and 
        in many of the bone and flint implements used; that its architecture, 
        on the other hand, showed certain resemblances to that of north-central 
        New Mexico in Pueblo III times (Largo-Gallina Phase) and Early Pueblo 
        IV times (northern Rio Grande and Jemez area). This circumstance, together 
        with occasional appearance of Puebloan trade sherds datable at circa 1300 
        to 1450 A.D., in Antelope Creek components, indicated that the latter 
        existed during that period and possibly for a time before trade contacts 
        began. The similarities with Upper Republican, combined with certain lines 
        of reasoning about the age of Upper Republican by Plains archaeologists, 
        made it seem that Antelope Creek Focus was at least partly contemporaneous 
        with this culture. Upper Republican may, however, have been in existence 
        for some time previously, enjoying a longer life than Antelope Creek. 
        The latter seems to have been not only geographically intermediate between 
        Upper Republican and eastern Puebloan cultures, but also to have been 
        a cultural agent through which typical Plains traits reached Pecos Pueblo 
        in early Glaze periods. It was also shown that the Canadian Valley of 
        Texas was abandoned by this agricultural population at about 1450, that 
        there are reasons to believe a protracted drought caused or contributed 
        to this abandonment, and that the Panhandle was inhabited only by nomadic 
        bison hunters, probably Apache, by the time of Coronado&#8217;s entrada.</p>
