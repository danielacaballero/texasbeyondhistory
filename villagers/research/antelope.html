                  <p>World War II brought about a virtual halt to archeological   fieldwork in the Texas Panhandle as elsewhere in the United States, but there   was still one big payoff yet to come from the New Deal archeological projects.   In 1946, just after the war ended, <STRONG>Alex D. Krieger</STRONG> published a   ground-breaking study entitled <EM><STRONG>Culture Complexes and Chronology in   Northern Texas</STRONG></EM> that included a formal definition and thorough   synthesis of what he termed the <STRONG>Antelope Creek focus</STRONG>. Krieger&rsquo;s   study was the first concerted effort to make sense of the various pottery-making   and corn-growing prehistoric cultures in the Southern Plains and the adjacent   prairies and timbers across northern Texas. His ultimate scholarly goal was to   link the relatively well-established chronology (dating framework) of the   Puebloan Southwest to the poorly dated Mississippian region west of the   Mississippi River (i.e., the Caddo area of east Texas and adjacent states).   
                  <p>At the time Krieger was a research scientist at the University of   Texas at Austin where he had been hired in 1939 to supervise the state&rsquo;s largest   WPA archeological laboratory. In contrast to most earlier archeologists, Krieger   had the scholarly training to grasp the complexity of ancient cultural history   and the discipline to carefully distinguish between observation and   interpretation, assertion and inference, fact and opinion. While most   archeologists of the day were drawn to digging, Krieger was primarily a   laboratory-based analyst and writer. His 1946 study earned him the <STRONG>1948   Viking Fund Medal</STRONG> in archeology, one of the highest honors in the   field. His 1949 report on the George C. Davis site, a major Early Caddo mound   site in east Texas (co-authored with WPA excavator Perry Newell), is still   considered one of the classic archeological studies of all time. </p>
                  <p>Krieger understood that systematic frameworks and consistent sets   of terms were needed for communication, comparison, and interpretation. But he   also knew that such concepts were merely trial approximations that later   researchers would improve upon or reject entirely. Krieger went to great lengths   to carefully point out the limitations of the interpretive schemes he used as   well as the many information gaps and uncertainties within the field data upon   which his ideas were based. </p>
                  <p>In 1945, when Krieger turned his attention to the archeology of   the Texas Panhandle, he approached the task in his typically methodical way. He   read everything published on the topic and studied as many artifact collections   as he could get his hands on. His first-hand experience in the area was limited   to brief visits to some of the major Antelope Creek sites as well as the   Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum. Floyd Studer was Krieger's major informant,   but he also examined the extensive collections amassed by several landowners in   strategic parts of the region. What mattered most to Krieger was solid evidence   and he was perfectly willing to consult with collectors and amateur   archeologists as well as his professional colleagues</p>
                  <p align="left" class="timelinetext">To attempt to classify 
                    Antelope Creek Focus as either a Plains or Puebloan culture 
                    is infeasible, for it was clearly a combination of both. &#8230; 
                    One can hardly escape the impression that the peoples of this 
                    focus were Plains agriculturalists who pushed southward from 
                    one valley to another as far as eastern New Mexico. Here contact 
                    was established with Puebloans who were expanding their territories 
                    at the same time. &#8230; Contact with Puebloans, however, 
                    explains little. If Puebloan architectural elements were established 
                    in the Canadian Valley of Texas, should there not be more 
                    Puebloan pottery in the ruins than the few dozen pieces found 
                    to date? &#8230; The situation clearly points to selective 
                    borrowing and acculturation between the two peoples.<br>

                    -- Krieger 1946, p. 73</p>
                  <p>In the first part of the 1946 study, Krieger critically reviewed   what was known about Plains Village sites in the Texas Panhandle and adjacent   areas of western Oklahoma, northeastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, and   southeastern Kansas. He masterfully summarized the important points made by   earlier researchers and tactfully pointed out key assertions and conclusions   others had reached without presenting solid evidence. For instance, Krieger   expressed reservations about Studer&rsquo;s claim that Antelope Creek houses had flat   roofs. &ldquo;Show me the data,&rdquo; seems to have been Krieger's mantra. The review is   followed by a synthesis of the Antelope Creek focus and considerations of its   dating and relationships to other cultures. (Download Krieger&rsquo;s 1946 review and   synthesis in <A href="images/krieger-1946-excerpts.html" target="blank">PDF format</A>.) </p>
                  <p>Krieger proposed the Antelope Creek focus concept to replace the   loosely applied labels that others had used including the Texas Panhandle   culture, the Panhandle phase, the Panhandle culture, the Texas Panhandle Pueblo   culture, the Canadian culture, the Panhandle-Canadian culture, and the   Slab-House culture. In doing so he adapted a relatively new classification   scheme called the <STRONG>Midwestern taxonomic method</STRONG> or <STRONG>McKern   system</STRONG> after its chief proponent, <STRONG>W. C. McKern</STRONG>. This   hierarchical scheme was conceived of as analogous to the biological   classification system created by the renown 18th-century Swedish naturalist,   Carolus Linnaeus. In place of the Linnaean family&gt;genus&gt;species, were   McKern&rsquo;s <STRONG>pattern&gt;phase&gt;aspect&gt;focus</STRONG> (broadest to   narrowest groupings). But unlike biological species, archeological site   assemblages (groups of artifacts consistently found together) were poorly suited   to be classified using such a scheme. </p>
                  <p>Site assemblages were created by groups of people (cultures,   tribes, bands, etc.) who were biologically and culturally interrelated in   complex ways and historically connected through time and across geographical   space. McKern&rsquo;s classification system relied on trait-by-trait comparisons and   ignored time and space, the two most important variables in reconstructing <STRONG>culture history,</STRONG> how cultures changed and interacted through   time. In fairness, when McKern proposed his system in the 1930s, radiocarbon   dating hadn&rsquo;t been invented and the age of most archeological sites in the   Midwest was poorly known, so it seemed natural to define cultural relationships   based on observed similarities. Interested readers can find web pages and entire   books devoted to discussing the McKern system and why it failed. </p>
                  <p>Krieger realized the chief limitations of the McKern system and   tried to adapt it by starting at the narrowest and easiest-to-define grouping,   the focus. He thought McKern proponents erred in trying to start with the   broadest level &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; and then defining ever-narrower groupings, a process he   felt was bound to fail. Krieger believed, however, that the reverse strategy   might work&ndash;start with the narrow groupings we can be most certain of, like   Antelope Creek, and then attempt to work out more abstract, higher-level   cultural relationships. He also saw no reason that the narrower groupings could   not be limited to geographical clusters of archeological assemblages and sites   dating to limited periods of time. His approach was eminently sensible. </p>
                  <p>Krieger conceived of the Antelope Creek focus as a relatively   consistent set of material traits (artifacts, architecture, food refuse, etc.)   occurring at a series of closely related archeological sites (Plains villages)   within a restricted area (the northern Texas Panhandle and nearby). The material   culture, he thought, was the product of a culture of closely related &ldquo;Plains   agriculturalists&rdquo; who had lived in the area for a relatively brief period of   time, roughly A.D. 1300-1450. He designated Antelope Creek 22 and Alibates Creek   28, the two largest and best-known sites investigated by the WPA, as the &ldquo;type&rdquo;   sites said to exemplify the Antelope Creek focus. </p>
                  <p>In order to allow for the probability that other, analogous foci   (plural of focus) would ultimately be recognized in the same general vicinity,   Krieger proposed the <STRONG>Panhandle aspect </STRONG>as a broader grouping,   but did not define it in the 1946 publication. He and his colleagues later   provided a definition of the Panhandle aspect in the 1954 Handbook. Although   archeologists continued to use these concepts for decades, most professional   archeologists active today consider the term "Panhandle aspect" to be outdated.   Improved versions of the Midwestern taxonomic method are still in use by some   archeologists, although they no longer resemble McKern&rsquo;s original system.   Antelope Creek, however, lives on today as a &ldquo;phase&rdquo; (not the same as a McKern   phase and still different from Sayle's phase) or, more simply put, an   archeological culture. </p>
                  <p>While some of Krieger&rsquo;s Antelope Creek ideas and inferences have   been refined or rejected by later researchers, much of what he figured out about   Plains Village life in the Texas Panhandle is remarkably close to the way we see   it today.</p>
                  <H3>Stamper site and the Optima focus</H3>
                  <p>During the 1940s and 1950s, few field investigations were   undertaken of Antelope Creek sites apart from continued site exploration and   documentation by Studer and his successor, Jack Hughes. One significant   development was a 1950 article by <STRONG>Virginia Watson</STRONG> on the   Stamper site in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Watson, an archeologist whose husband   taught anthropology at the University of Oklahoma, analyzed the materials from   the Stamper village that had been recovered by Johnston and Carder in the 1930s.   Her work was hampered by missing site maps and the disorganized nature of the   collections and notes. Nonetheless, she provided the first published account of   the site and called attention to the differences between the Stamper   architecture and that of the Antelope Creek type sites. The Stamper houses she   was aware of were isolated from one another instead of being arranged together   in a block like a pueblo. She also observed relatively minor differences in   artifacts. </p>
                  <p>On the basis of these differences, Watson followed Krieger&rsquo;s lead   and defined the <STRONG>Optima focus</STRONG>, which she proposed to be the   second grouping within the Panhandle aspect. The Optima focus, she argued,   represented a Plains Village culture that was intermediate, geographically and   chronologically, between the Upper Republican culture of the Central Plains and   Antelope Creek. Although Watson&rsquo;s Optima concept was used by Oklahoma   archeologists for several decades, it never really caught on elsewhere.   Subsequent work at other Plains Village sites in western Oklahoma has   complicated the picture and called into question many of the inferences upon   which the Optima focus was based. The recent (2002-2004) reanalysis of the   Stamper site by Chris Lintz has pointed out some of Watson&rsquo;s misinterpretations   due to the incomplete information she had to work with. </p>
                  <H3>Jack Hughes:<BR>
                    Dean of Panhandle Archeology</H3>
                  <p>When Jack T. Hughes arrived in Canyon in 1952 to take over   Studer&rsquo;s position at the PPHM, he ushered in a new era for Panhandle archeology.   Hughes was the museum&rsquo;s first paid curator of archeology and paleontology, but   he also taught part-time at West Texas State College (as WTSTC was then known),   as had C. Stuart Johnston in the 1930s. Like Johnston, Hughes had training in   both geology and anthropology, but didn&rsquo;t yet have his Ph.D.; he had completed   everything but his dissertation in anthropology at Columbia University.   Likewise, Hughes was charismatic and quickly became a favorite of students and   his colleagues at the museum and the college. Like Studer, Hughes had a penchant   for exploration and came to know the Panhandle and the northern Llano Estacado   as well as any archeologist probably ever will. But there the similarities with   his predecessors stop. </p>
                  <p>Jack Hughes' first dissertation topic (a pottery analysis) was   rejected by his major professor at Columbia, William Duncan Strong. Encouraged   to take on a more challenging problem, Hughes decided to try to reconstruct the   culture history and prehistory of the Caddoan language family. This required   mastering and synthesizing large sets of archeological, historical,   ethnological, and linguistic data, a process that took him over a decade worked   in around his museum and teaching responsibilities. Upon completion of his Ph.D.   in 1968, Hughes became a full time professor at West Texas State University and   had a long and successful teaching career in Canyon. In contrast to Studer, he   wasn&rsquo;t possessive about Panhandle archeology; instead, he encouraged hundreds of   budding archeologists to try their own hand in it, including well over a dozen   professional archeologists who are still active today. By the time he retired   from teaching in 1985, Jack Hughes had become a legend in his own time, a man   often called the <STRONG>Dean of Panhandle Archeology</STRONG>. </p>
                  <p>For Hughes, the Antelope Creek villages were only one aspect of   Panhandle archeology. He was just as interested, perhaps even more so, in sites   representing the earlier Woodland, Archaic, and Paleoindian cultures. And   although he visited and recorded hundreds of Plains villages and dug at dozens   of them, he never wrote formal reports on most of the work. </p>
                  <p>Regardless, Hughes did direct important excavations at various   Antelope Creek sites in the Texas Panhandle. Most of the work was accomplished   with little or no funding and a heavy reliance on student and avocational   volunteers. Hughes preferred the term &ldquo;Panhandle aspect&rdquo; instead of "Antelope   Creek focus," perhaps because he recognized a great deal more variation among   the Plains Villager sites he investigated than Krieger&rsquo;s definition of the   Antelope Creek focus would accommodate. Among these sites, Hughes excavated the <STRONG>Marsh </STRONG>sites with the West Texas State University Anthropology   Society; the <STRONG>Roper</STRONG>, <STRONG>Pickett</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Cottonwood Creek</STRONG> sites with the Norpan (Northern Panhandle)   Archaeological Society; the <STRONG>Zollars</STRONG> site with the Panhandle   Archeological Society; and <STRONG>Sanford Ruin</STRONG> with the   Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum. Many of these sites fell within an area that   is today periodically inundated by Lake Meredith. </p>
                  <H3>Archeology of Sanford Reservoir </H3>
                  <p>The federal government&rsquo;s decision in 1960 to dam the Canadian   River near the town of Sanford in Hutchinson County had a far-reaching effect on   both the archeology and the understanding of Antelope Creek villagers. The   impoundment, originally called Sanford Reservoir and later renamed <STRONG>Lake   Meredith</STRONG>, is located in the middle of the core Antelope Creek region.   Sanford Dam was completed in 1965 and the reservoir soon began to fill. </p>
                  <p>In 1961, archeologists from the Texas Archeological Salvage   Project at the University of Texas at Austin began studying the area that would   be inundated by the reservoir under contract to the National Park Service.   Archeologists <STRONG>W.A. Davis</STRONG> and <STRONG>Bill Harrison</STRONG> had   only ten days to survey 46,350 acres of rugged terrain in search of important   archeological sites. While a thorough survey by today&rsquo;s standards would require   months of work, Davis and Harrison located and documented 51 sites in the   allotted time, a fraction of the sites that must have been present. Today, a   survey (inventory) effort would be followed by a testing (evaluation) phase to   determine which sites have the best potential to yield important information.   But in 1961, there was no time or money for careful inventory or evaluation. </p>
                  <p>The following year (1962), excavations were undertaken at three   Plains Village sites located in areas that would be impacted by the construction   of Sanford Dam. Instead of large ruins with contiguous rooms, the <STRONG>Conner</STRONG>, <STRONG>Medford Ranch</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Spring   Canyon</STRONG> sites were small sites with several isolated or paired   structures that varied considerably in size and construction. <STRONG>Lathel   Duffield</STRONG>&rsquo;s 1962 report on the work pointed out that the architecture of   these sites didn&rsquo;t fit that of the Antelope Creek focus defined by Krieger,   perhaps because earlier archeologists had only investigated the larger sites. </p>
                  <p>In 1963-1964, <STRONG>F. Earl Green</STRONG> at the Museum of   Texas Technical College (now Texas Tech University) excavated six additional   sites in the area that would become Lake Meredith. Four of these were Plains   Village sites, including the Arrowhead Peak site, a block of 4 or 5 rooms that   occupied a defensible position. The other three were open sites with isolated or   paired structures. The <STRONG>Footprint </STRONG>site was remarkable because   one of the three isolated houses there was the scene of a complex sequence of   violence. </p>
                  <p><STRONG>Footprint House 1</STRONG> contained the skeletal remains   of at least 32 individuals. Some of the bones were scattered across the house   floor, some were found within burial pits dug into the floor and some were found   with the post-abandonment fill covering the floor. The most distinctive   arrangement was a tight cluster of ten adult skulls found within the fill layer   above the floor. Pothunters had dug into one corner of the room, removing some   bones and complicating things even further. According to Lintz, later   researchers inferred that many of the individuals were massacre victims whose   partially dismembered bodies were scattered across the room floor. The house was   apparently burned soon after (or during) the massacre event and was abandoned.   The skulls are suspected to represent &ldquo;trophy&rdquo; heads placed within a pit dug   into the burned and abandoned house, perhaps to commemorate the avenging of the   earlier massacre. Tellingly, the skeletal features of the skulls do not match   those of Antelope Creek people and presumably represent their enemies. These   findings underscore the importance of warfare and conflict in Antelope Creek   life. </p>

                          site was selected because it was in the immediate vicinity 
                          of where construction on Sanford Dam would take place 
                          and because it appeared to represent an Antelope Creek

                          did the lion&#8217;s share of the archeology that was

                          As a result of federal laws passed soon after the lake 
                          was built, a similar reservoir project today would result 
                          in years of concentrated archeological investigation 
                          to mitigate the loss of information. This photo by Chris 
                          Lintz was taken in the 1980s when the reservoir was 
                          full, a rare occurrence these days. </div>

                          diameter. Both structures had a small trash midden just

                          these really were habitations. Bill Harrison, who would
