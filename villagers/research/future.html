        <tr>
          <td><p class="text">The past century has witnessed many excavations 
              at Antelope Creek sites and a much smaller number of substantial 
              published results. Archeologists now have a fairly good grasp of 
              the "material signature" of Antelope Creek culture&#8212;the characteristic 
              architectural patterns, artifacts, and ecofacts (animal bones and 
              such). And we have begun to understand the geographic extent and 
              variation of Antelope Creek and related Plains Village cultures 
              in the region. But what we know pales by comparison to what archeologists 
              could and, frankly, should know by now. 
            <p class="text">Consider, for example, that as of 2004 fewer than 
              a half a dozen published reports have described, counted, illustrated, 
              measured, and identified source material for the stone tools and 
              pottery fragments recovered from a specific excavation at an Antelope 
              Creek site. Such technical details may seem mundane and even boring 
              to the general reader, but they are the critical building blocks 
              upon which any archeological scholar must depend. Good science demands 
              good data, good published data. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Improved understandings of the Plains villagers 
              of the Texas Panhandle will require a lot more of what is known 
              in other fields as &quot;basic research.&quot;</strong> We do not 
              mean simply &quot;more digging,&quot; we mean a lot more top-notch 
              research, in the field and the laboratory. Research carried out 
              by thoughtful design and research that is carried through to proper 
              completion including full reporting of all the technical details. 
            <H3>A Dozen Antelope Creek Research Problems</H3>
            <p class="text"> While dozens and dozens of basic 
              research needs, large and small, could and should be spelled out 
              and pursued, listed below are a dozen worthy research problems and 
              needs as identified by archeologists Chris Lintz, Doug Boyd, and 
              Scott Brosowske. The first four items are very basic research needs 
              upon which almost all interpretations of Antelope Creek culture 
              rely. </p>
              
            <p class="text"><strong>(1) Dating.</strong> We still need many more radiocarbon 
              dates from Antelope Creek sites to refine our understanding of the 
              origins, development, and demise of Plains Village life in the Texas 
              Panhandle. Lintz and others have put forth some intriguing arguments, 
              but most of these cannot be properly evaluated without more rigorous 
              sets of dates from a variety of sites, contexts, and settings. </p>
			 
            <p class="text"> While radiocarbon is the most widely accepted and 
              commonly used dating method, other useful techniques have been around 
              for awhile (such as archeomagnetic dating, thermoluminescence, and 
              obsidian hydration dating), and there are some new promising techniques 
              on the horizon. For instance, optically stimulated luminescence 
              measures the elapsed time that the quartz particles within buried 
              sand deposits were last exposed to sunlight and the technique could 
              be a particularly important tool in future archeological studies 
              in the region.</P>
              
            <p class="text"><strong>(2) Paleoenvironment.</strong> The past climatic history 
              of the Texas Panhandle before, during, and after the Plains Village 
              era remains imprecisely understood. While much has been made of 
              the apparent onset of drought conditions around A.D. 1250 and the 
              increasingly inhospitable conditions for the next 150-200 years, 
              our interpretations are based largely on extrapolations of climatic 
              data from neighboring regions. We need better paleoclimatic data 
              from the heartland of Antelope Creek culture. </p>
              
            <p class="text"><strong>(3) Economy. </strong>We still have a very inadequate 
              understanding of how Antelope Creek people supported themselves. 
              Until recently, domesticated crops (including corn, beans, and squash) 
              were generally assumed to have supplied most of the food upon which 
              Antelope Creek people depended. This assumption seems at odds with 
              the argument that the region experienced worsening drought conditions 
              during Antelope Creek days. Studies of animal bones indicate that 
              a wide range of species large and small were hunted, trapped, bopped, 
              and netted. Even so, at some sites almost 90% of the bone was broken 
              and reduced into unidentifiable fragments. This pattern is consistent 
              with the systematic extraction of bone grease and marrow, a practice 
              suggesting that every bit of food value was being removed from the 
              animal bones. Recent technological studies of ground stone manos 
              as well as isotopic chemical studies of human bones suggest that 
              horticulture (early agriculture) may have played a relatively minor 
              role in food acquisition. </p>
              
            <p class="text">The idea that Antelope Creek people may have been 
              mainly gatherers and hunters who supplemented their diets with planted 
              crops does not seem consistent with the considerable evidence that 
              they were semi-sedentary (living in one place) for much of the year. 
              This suggests that Antelope Creek culture would make a most interesting 
              case study in Late Prehistoric survival strategies, but this will 
              require many more well-dated samples of plant and animal remains 
              from a variety of sites. The use of typical &frac14;-inch mesh sifting 
              screens, while a standard recovery practice in archeology, rarely 
              yields the tiny, but highly informative, pieces of charred plants 
              and small animal bones. It is imperative that all future excavations 
              take sediment samples and process them using the flotation technique 
              to increase the recovery of this important evidence.</p>
              <p class="text"><strong>(4) Tool Function.</strong> Detailed studies of the manufacturing, use, and 
              life cycles of the stone and bone tools used by Antelope Creek villagers 
              are needed. Even though archeologists routinely speculate about 
              the function of such tools based on their general form, detailed 
              studies elsewhere in the world suggest that the actual functional 
              uses of such tools are more complicated and meaningful. The same 
              is doubtlessly true for Antelope Creek. For instance, Marie Huhnke's 
              recent study of buffalo scapula (shoulder blade) implements from 
              Alibates 28 suggests that most were not suited to be used as agricultural 
              hoe blades, as previously assumed. Instead she postulates that scapula 
              tools probably served mainly as trowels for mixing and applying 
              mortar and plaster during house construction and maintenance. Many 
              such thoughtful analyses are needed to give us behavioural insights 
              into Antelope Creek life. </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>(5) Architectural Patterns. </strong> Settlements in the eastern Texas Panhandle, 
              particularly east and south of the Canadian River, seem to have 
              houses that lack stone foundations in favor of picket-post walls, 
              but yet they have the central channels, central hearths, &quot;altars,&quot; 
              and other floor features found in classic Antelope Creek houses. 
              What accounts for these architectural differences? Are they merely 
              reflections of local conditions and available building materials 
              or are they indications of distinct cultural groups, such as the 
              one apparently represented by the Zimms complex of western Oklahoma? </p>
              
            <p class="text">We generally know very little about what the superstructural 
              (above-ground) portions of the classic Antelope Creek houses looked 
              like. Some researchers, for example, feel these houses were more 
              like Plains earthlodges than Southwestern-style pithouses. Accurate 
              reconstructions of what prehistoric houses were really like must 
              be based on many lines of evidence, such as thoughtful analysis 
              of very detailed excavation data, special emphasis on understanding 
              post-depositional processes (what happens to a prehistoric house 
              once it is abandoned and buried), and even experimental archeology 
              aimed at replicating such houses.</p> 
           <p class="text"><strong>(6) Settlement Zones.</strong> Antelope Creek settlements do not occur uniformly 
              across the region. For instance, in the vicinity of Palo Duro Reservoir, 
              west of the Buried City area and between the Canadian and North 
              Canadian rivers, there are very few typical Antelope Creek stone 
              slab houses. Was this a &quot;no-man's land,&quot; a buffer zone 
              between major settlement zones, or simply a place were houses were 
              built with picket-post walls rather than with rock foundations? 
              More generally, how do we explain the distinct geographic clusters 
              of Antelope Creek sites?</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>(7) Field Huts or Guest Houses?</strong> The 1962 excavations 
              at the Conner site and several others in the Lake Meredith area 
              exposed small circular structures that were associated with relatively 
              few artifacts and a disproportionately high number of buffalo limb 
              elements (leg and foot bones) from only one side of the animal. 
              This pattern prompted Lathel Duffield to postulate that these may 
              have been seasonal field huts where villagers stayed while away 
              from their main homesteads and hamlets. (The bone pattern suggested 
              organized food sharing whereby family groups may have divided up 
              carcasses into equal portions.) Yet, recent studies of similar, 
              small circular structures at the Roper and Chicken Creek sites reveal 
              very robust assemblages of artifacts and bones rivaling those found 
              at any hamlet (i.e., a typical Antelope Creek &#8220;village&#8221;).</p>
              
            <p class="text">Are these smallish sites with circular structures 
              really clusters of seasonally occupied field huts or could they 
              be areas where visiting Plains Village groups stayed while they 
              traded for Alibates flint? In this model, the large, typical Antelope 
              Creek houses were home to the resident villagers who controlled 
              access to the flint quarries, while visitors lived in modest, temporary 
              quarters. Other possibilities exist, a fact that underscores the 
              need for more detailed analyses of Antelope Creek structures and 
              their associated debris.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>(8) Landergin Mesa Refuge? </strong>Lintz estimates that there may have been 
              as many as 95 isolated homestead-type structures built within the 
              half-acre top of Landergin Mesa and that these houses were built 
              over the duration of the Antelope Creek phase. This finding contradicts 
              his earlier notion that during early Antelope Creek days (which 
              he called the &#8220;subhomestead period&#8221;), houses were clustered 
              into room blocks, especially in a locality that has obvious, severe 
              spatial limitations. Why does the settlement pattern atop mesa sites 
              differ from the pattern identified around the Alibates quarries 
              (i.e., at Antelope Creek 22 and Alibates 28)? Was Landergin Mesa 
              used as a temporary refuge that was occupied for such brief periods 
              that contiguous structures (pueblo-like room blocks) never evolved? </p>
              
              <p class="text"><strong>(9) Antelope Creek Rock Art.</strong> Systematic archeological surveys (uniform, 
              thorough coverage of sizable areas) have taken place in the Antelope 
              Creek region only very recently (since the late 1990s). As a result, 
              some new site density and distribution patterns are being seen. 
              For instance, studies of the burned-off areas at the Alibates National 
              Flint Quarries have found numerous examples of rock art in apparent 
              association with Antelope Creek habitation sites. The rock art in 
              question presumably consists mainly of boulders with petroglyphs 
              (pecked designs) or &#8220;cupules&quot; (cup-shaped pecked areas). 
              Better known petroglyph designs thought to be associated with Antelope 
              Creek culture include footprints and turtles. Some have also argued 
              that certain pictographs (painted designs) were created by Antelope 
              Creek artists, but pictographs are rare in the Texas Panhandle. 
              We are a long way from understanding which designs (if any) were 
              actually executed by Antelope Creek peoples. Thorough documentation, 
              dating, and analysis of such rock art sites might reveal common 
              design patterns that tell us something about Antelope Creek symbolic 
              and ritual life. </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>(10) Agricultural Technology.</strong> What particular methods were used 
              to grow corn, beans, and squash? Where, specifically, were most 
              of the agricultural fields situated relative to Antelope Creek villages? 
              Did they plant fields in the middle of the floodplains and hope 
              the floods would spare the crops? Or were the main fields on top 
              of the first major terraces above the floodplains? Where appropriate, 
              were crops planted adjacent to sand dunes to take advantage of the 
              water that drains from the base of saturated dunes? Or perhaps fields 
              were planted below steep slopes in places where run-off water could 
              be diverted to specific fields? While it is almost certainly the 
              case that various planting strategies were employed, the ancient 
              agricultural technology of the region has received precious little 
              careful study. </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>(11) Plains Villager Interactions.</strong>The distinct marine shell and 
              turquoise jewelry, obsidian, and painted ceramic vessels made by, 
              or at least obtained from, Southwestern groups are relatively easy 
              to recognize as non-indigenous (foreign) trade goods in Antelope 
              Creek sites. It is much more difficult to discern the trade items 
              obtained from other Plains Village groups in the Southern and Central 
              Plains, groups who made similar kinds of pottery and used similar 
              kinds of stone resources. Difficult, but not impossible. Detailed 
              studies are needed of the pottery paste characteristics and raw 
              material sources (based on trace elements) of sizable samples of 
              cordmarked pottery before we can really understand the nature of 
              Plains Village interactions. </p>
              
            <p class="text"><strong>(12) Cultural Identity and Conflict.</strong> Who were 
              the Antelope Creek peoples, who were they most closely related to, 
              and who were their enemies? In a recent summary of Antelope Creek 
              culture, Oklahoma state archeologist Robert Brooks wrote that, &#8220;Much 
              of the Antelope Creek mystique is linked to the biological characteristics 
              of the population. While study of this area is clouded by the propriety 
              of examining human remains, for tribes as well as archeologists, 
              systematic evaluation of the biological nature of these groups is 
              critical to our understanding of the origin and ultimate destination 
              of the group and its culture.&#8221; Many questions about the ethnic 
              identities of Antelope Creek and other Plains Village peoples can 
              be addressed using modern scientific techniques such as DNA studies 
              and craniometric (skull measurement) data analysis. Furthermore, 
              other innovative techniques such as a bone chemistry study called 
              isotope analysis can provide direct evidence on human diet that 
              can be used to define a group&#8217;s economy and cultural identity. 
            </p>
              
              <p class="text">The trophy skulls at the Footprint site and the finding of numerous 
              burials with evidence of violence (such as embedded arrow points) 
              in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma demonstrate that considerable 
              hostility took place in Antelope Creek times. But who was fighting 
              whom? Were Antelope Creek villagers fighting each other? Or was 
              it raids by competing villagers from elsewhere in the Southern Plains? 
              Perhaps, late in Antelope Creek times, it was mainly non-villager 
              Athabascan-speaking intruders (ancestors of the Apache peoples) 
              from the northwest. Was the violence simply an inevitable consequence 
              of unstable &#8220;trade and raid&#8221; relationships with Puebloan 
              peoples of the Southwest? It seems quite likely that conflicts occurred 
              between and among various groups in the region for various reasons, 
              but we are a long way from understanding even the broad outlines 
              of what happened. </p>
            <p class="text">Although it is not always a pleasant topic of discussion, 
              prehistoric warfare may have had a huge impact on the lives of various 
              prehistoric groups in and around the Southern Plains. In his book 
              <em>Prehistoric Warfare in the American Southwest</em>, Steven LeBlanc 
              put it succinctly when he said of warfare: &quot;It cannot be ignored 
              or relegated to a footnote, if the past is to be understood.&quot;</p>
            <h3>Preserving the Past for the Future</h3>
            
            <p><span class="text"> Antelope Creek architectural remains tend to 
              stick up like an unnaturally square thumb on the landscape of the 
              Texas Panhandle. As a result, most sites in the Canadian River Valley 
              have been vandalized, some much worse than others. For every Antelope 
              Creek house that archeologists have excavated, 10 or 20 others have 
              been dug into or completely destroyed by others. </span><span class="text">Explorers, 
              treasure hunters, pothunters, and curiousity seekers have all dug 
              up Antelope Creek houses and most were disappointed by what they 
              found. The combined forces of progress, housing development, and 
              commerce have also taken their inevitable toll and torn asunder 
              many ancient settlement areas. </span></p>
            <p class="text">Even so, many traces of Antelope Creek life yet remain; 
              if not untouched, they are at least recognizable and capable of 
              yielding telltale scientific clues about the human past. But today's 
              archeologists can only do so much. Even if we had unlimited time 
              and funding, we know that the archeologists of the future will have 
              analytical tools and research goals we never dreamed of. By modern 
              standards, most of Floyd Studer's archeological field techniques 
              were crude and not very scientifically productive, and we can be 
              sure that archeologists 50 years from now will look back at us with 
              equal disappointment. From the archeological perspective, that is 
              why preserving/conserving ancient sites and ancient landscapes by 
              leaving them intact and undisturbed is a worthy and ethical goal.</p>
            <p class="text">There is another, more important consideration. If 
              those of us living in the early 21st century don't make concerted 
              efforts to preserve important archeological sites, future generations 
              may not consider us too kindly. Every generation of Panhandle residents 
              looks across the landscape, flatlands and breaks alike, with wonder. 
              <strong>How did those who came before us survive and even thrive 
              for so many generations?</strong> The story of the Antelope Creek 
              culture isn't entirely lost and we owe it to our great grandchildren 
              to learn what we can about our human ancestors and predecessors 
              and to do that we must preserve meaningful traces of past for the 
              future. </p>

                   The Canadian River Valley in the eastern 
                    Texas Panhandle was apparently settled sparsely by Plains

                    west farther upstream. This impression may not be entirely
