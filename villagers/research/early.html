                 <p class="text">In 1907, <strong>T.L. Eyerly </strong>and his 
              students from the Canadian Academy, a small Baptist school in the 
              town of Canadian, explored the &#8220;Buried City&#8221; along Wolf 
              Creek in Ochiltree County. As detailed in the <a href="../buriedcity/index.html" class="text">Buried 
              City exhibit</a>, this Plains Village locality had (and still has) 
              an impressive concentration of ruins, particularly the remains of 
              large houses with stone foundations. Local residents had already 
              dubbed the site the &#8220;Buried City,&#8221; a characterization 
              that Eyerly rejected. Like Woodruff, he thought the Plains village 
              ruins were mainly graves. During the brief Wolf Creek expedition, 
              Eyerly and his students apparently dug into several of the buildings 
              and probably encountered burials, giving them a false impression. 
              The expedition was the first organized archeological investigation 
              in Texas. Eyerly&#8217;s 1907 report on the work was the first scientific 
              documentation of an archeological site in the state. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Because of Eyerly&#8217;s reports (he published several 
              similar accounts in different journals) and, perhaps more importantly, 
              because of the efforts of one of Eyerly&#8217;s students, <strong>Floyd 
              Studer</strong>, the existence of Buried City and other Plains Village 
              sites in the Texas Panhandle began to attract national attention. 
              Studer would become the central figure in Panhandle archeology for 
              some 50 years. According to Studer, it was he at age 15 who had 
              egged on his teacher, Eyerly, to mount the 1907 Wolf Creek expedition. 
              And it was Floyd Studer&#8217;s passionate interest in Panhandle 
              history that resulted in visits to the area by some of the leading 
              figures in American archeology. </p>
                
            <p class="text">After graduating from the Canadian Academy, Studer 
              joined the family ranching business, got married, and served as 
              an officer in a local bank. In 1925, he moved to Amarillo and became 
              involved in the insurance business. He continued his life-long interest 
              in local history by visiting every archeological site he learned 
              about. He also wrote letters to archeologists in the major academic 
              and research institutions in the Eastern U.S. urging them to take 
              note of the important ruins in the Texas Panhandle, especially the 
              Buried City. Passing references hint that he must have also sent 
              artifact samples to some of these institutions to pique their curiosity.

            <p class="text">The Buried City and other substantial ruins in the 
              Texas Panhandle drew the interest of professional archeologists 
              because of the area&#8217;s strategic location between the Puebloan 
              Southwest and the Mississippian Midwestern and Southeastern United 
              States. At the time it was widely believed that cultural developments 
              in the Southwest were heavily influenced by the civilizations of 
              ancient Mexico. Some authorities also thought that the Mound Builders 
              of the Southeast and Midwest must have been influenced by prehispanic 
              cultures in Mexico. The Southern Plains was seen as a key area where 
              evidence of the movement of things (pottery, corn agriculture, etc.) 
              and ideas (such as mound building) might be found. More generally, 
              the occurrence of substantial ruins of stone architecture did not 
              seem to match what was known about historic Plains Indians and raised 
              many questions. Was the Panhandle area a forgotten outpost of the 
              Puebloan Southwest? Or perhaps Pueblo culture began there before 
              moving west? To answer such questions, prestigious scientists began 
              visiting the Texas Panhandle and digging into the Plains Village 
              ruins.</p>
                  
            <p class="text">The first was archeologist and ethnologist <strong>Jessie 
              Walter Fewkes</strong> of the Bureau of American Ethnology at the 
              Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., who paid a brief visit 
              to Buried City in 1914 or 1915. Apparently, he dug into at least 
              one structure and found a burial, but seems to have decided that 
              the site paled in comparison to the more impressive ruins he was 
              familiar with in the American Southwest. Fewkes is best known for 
              his work at Mesa Verde, the Hopi mesas, and the Mimbres Valley in 
              the American Southwest. Although a prolific author, he never wrote 
              a published account of his Buried City visit. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Another leading American archeologist, <strong>Warren 
              King Moorehead</strong>, developed a more serious interest in the 
              area. From his post as head of the Peabody Museum at Phillips Academy, 
              a private preparatory school in Andover, Massachusetts, Moorehead 
              launched exploratory archeological expeditions to many different 
              areas in the Eastern United States. By 1915 he was familiar with 
              much of the eastern United States and decided to look farther west 
              beyond the Mississippi and beyond the territories of the Mound-Builder 
              cultures. In 1916 Moorehead began working with <strong>Professor 
              J. B. Thoburn</strong> of the Oklahoma Historical Society and they 
              explored sites along the lower Arkansas River including the famous 
              site of Spiro, the significance of which was then unknown. Recognizing 
              that this area was still part of Mound-Builder territory, Moorehead 
              expanded his search westward up the Arkansas and its tributaries. 
              Moorehead probably learned of the stone ruins of the Texas Panhandle 
              through letters from Floyd Studer and by reading Eyerly&#8217;s 
              accounts. </p>
                
            <p class="text">Although he held a prestigious post, Moorehead was 
              largely a self-educated man obsessed since youth with archeology 
              and American Indians. Because of his lack of formal training, he 
              was apparently uncomfortable with the fact that American archeology 
              was becoming dominated by professional archeologists at major universities. 
              Moorehead depended on wealthy East Coast patrons to support his 
              work and raising the money to explore the Arkansas Valley must have 
              been quite a challenge. Keep in mind that few overland transportation 
              systems had been developed in the early 20th century beyond the 
              urban areas and railroads. These factors help explain why Moorehead&#8217;s 
              exploration project seems to have unfolded slowly and irregularly. 
            </p>
                  
            <p class="text">When he had funds, Moorehead hired assistants and 
              sent them out. In 1917 he sent Harvard-trained archeologist <strong>Fredrich 
              H. Sterns</strong> to Buried City to do preliminary work including 
              excavation. Sterns had already done similar exploration in the Central 
              Plains. Sadly, within a year Sterns and Moorehead had a falling 
              out over who had the intellectual rights to the Buried City findings 
              and they ended up in court battling over the field notes and artifacts. 
              Stung by the debacle, Moorehead hired an untrained but willing explorer 
              from Fort Smith, Arkansas, <strong>C. B. Franklin</strong>. In 1919 
              Franklin retraced Sterns footsteps at Buried City and also visited 
              other sites in the eastern Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. 
              Finally, in 1920 Moorehead himself excavated for three weeks at 
              Buried City and then visited a number of other Plains Village sites 
              in the central Panhandle, an area we today recognize as the core 
              of Antelope Creek culture. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Moorehead and his associates including Studer, who 
              undoubtedly led Moorehead to most of the sites he visited, identified 
              over 100 sites in the Texas Panhandle and described considerable 
              diversity in location and architecture. Moorehead felt a sense of 
              urgency because archeological resources were being damaged and stolen 
              as an indirect result of oil exploration in the Texas Panhandle. 
              Sites were recorded along Tarbox and Cottonwood creeks. Along Antelope 
              Creek, Moorehead visited a large, multi-room pueblo-like structure, 
              <strong>Antelope Creek Ruin 22 </strong>(named by Studer), that 
              was to become famous. Moorehead was the first archeologist to proclaim 
              that the Antelope Creek ruins were neither Puebloan nor Mississippian; 
              instead, he saw them as part of the Canadian Valley or Texas Panhandle 
              culture. He described the Texas Panhandle as an area containing 
              important archeology where Cliff Dweller (Puebloan), Plains tribes, 
              and Texas cultures came in to contact. </p>
            <p class="text">After 1920 Moorehead turned his attention to the now-famous 
              major mound sites of Cahokia (Illinois) in the Midwest and  Etowah (Georgia) in the  Southeast. Most 
              of the results of his &#8220;Arkansas expedition&#8221; were not 
              reported until 1931 when he published <em>Archaeology of the Arkansas 
              River Valley</em>, which includes the edited field notes and reconnaissance 
              maps of Floyd Studer. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">By then several other archeologists had led their 
              own expeditions to the Texas Panhandle and had promptly published 
              their results. For instance, <strong>J. Alden Mason</strong> of 
              the University of Pennsylvania Museum led a 1929 expedition to the 
              Texas Panhandle to explore sites along the upper Canadian. Among 
              the sites that Mason tested was <strong>Alibates Ruin 28</strong>, 
              another Studer site that would become famous. Mason identified a 
              building pattern of rectangular houses with four central roof support 
              posts and realized that the artifacts were characteristic of the 
              Plains, while the architecture was similar to pueblos in the Southwest. 
              Although he initially described the result as a Southwest/Plains 
              cultural hybrid, he later argued that the culture was Plains in 
              origin. Mason, like Moorehead, felt Texas might be the key to many 
              important problems concerning the relationships of Mexican, Pueblo, 
              Plains, and Southeastern Indian cultures.</p>
                  
            <p class="text">The year 1929 also saw the first archeological expedition 
              in the region from a Texas university. History professor <strong>W. 
              C. &#8220;Curry&#8221; Holden</strong> of the Texas Technical College 
              at Lubbock (today's Texas Tech University) had begun taking groups 
              of students to sites in the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. 
              Holden wanted to explore the relationships among Pueblo and Plains 
              Village sites. During the next few years he and his students carried 
              out extensive test excavations at a series of prominent Antelope 
              Creek sites in Texas including Tarbox Ruin, Antelope Creek 22, and 
              Saddleback Ruin. The results were published in the <em>Bulletin 
              of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society</em> and 
              in several student theses. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">During the summer of 1932, <strong>E.B. Sayles</strong> 
              visited the Panhandle as part of a statewide reconnaissance for 
              the Gila Pueblo, a private research foundation headquartered in 
              Globe, Arizona. Sayles was a native of Abilene and, with his friend 
              Cyrus Ray, had been one of the founders of the Texas Archeological 
              and Paleontological Society (today&#8217;s TAS) in 1928. In 1932, 
              Sayles was a self-taught archeologist just embarking on a long professional 
              career, most of which would be spent in Arizona and the Southwest. 
              His reconnaissance work in Texas was an ambitious, even audacious, 
              attempt to compare archeological sites across the state, define 
              its prehistoric cultures, and examine the relationships between 
              various regions. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Sayles&#8217; unpublished field notes show that he 
              visited 21 sites in the Panhandle and carried out minor excavations 
              at Antelope Creek 22, Alibates 28, and Saddleback Ruin. He spent 
              the most time (four days) at Antelope Creek 22, where Curry Holden 
              and his students had been working. Sayles dug in several places, 
              including a trench through a circular room designated as Room A. 
              Room A protruded from the northeast corner of the main room block 
              and was the only large circular structure (the other large rooms 
              were rectangular). Studer thought it was a kiva (Puebloan ceremonial 
              room), but Sayles recognized that it was actually a residential 
              room added late in the site's history. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">The day after he finished digging at Antelope Creek 
              22, Sayles wrote a six-page manuscript entitled &quot;Conjectural 
              Evolution of the Slab House of the Panhandle.&quot; This fascinating 
              document was never published, but it is of interest to serious students. 
              It reveals that Sayles was a keen observer who reached his own conclusions 
              based on what he saw, &quot;without regard to previous publications 
              on the site.&quot; (<a href="images/sayles-1932.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">View 
              Sayles manuscript</a> in pdf format.)</p>
                  
            <p class="text">Unfortunately, little of what Sayles learned about 
              the Panhandle villages is discussed in his 1935 report, <em>An Archaeological 
              Survey of Texas</em>. This study is largely a compilation of comparative 
              tables, interpretive maps, and broad characterizations attempting 
              to link a small number of historically known tribes with archeological 
              cultures now known to span well over 10,000 years. While Sayles&#8217; 
              study was an impressive accomplishment, given the limited state 
              of knowledge of the day, it had little impact on the development 
              of Texas archeology. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Still, Sayles noted the occurrence of many house ruins 
              representing what he called a &#8220;Panhandle phase&#8221; agricultural 
              group along the Canadian River. He cited Holden&#8217;s finds of 
              Puebloan pottery at Saddleback Ruin to estimate the age of these 
              sites at A.D. 1350, an estimate still regarded as falling squarely 
              within the Antelope Creek occupation span. </p>
                  
            <p class="text">Thus by the mid 1930s the Texas Panhandle was archeological 
              <em>terra incognito</em> no more. The existence of numerous ruins 
              of stone-based buildings was known nationally. The full age range 
              of the ruins was uncertain, but known to be prehistoric and at least 
              partially contemporary with relatively late Pueblo ruins in nearby 
              New Mexico. The relationship between the Texas Panhandle culture 
              and the Pueblo societies of New Mexico and the Southwest was being 
              debated. To paraphrase Curry Holden, there were three logical possibilities: 
              (1) the Pueblo sites were older and had given rise to the Panhandle 
              culture; (2) Panhandle culture was older and gave rise to the Pueblos; 
              or (3) the Texas Panhandle culture developed more or less independently 
              of Pueblo culture. Several more decades would pass before the third 
              option became widely accepted. </p>
