            <p class="text">The best-known Plains Village tradition in the Texas 
              Panhandle is the <strong>Antelope Creek culture</strong>, which 
              began about <strong>A.D. 1100-1200</strong>. Archeological clues 
              show that the Apache groups who moved into the region about the 
              time the villagers left (<strong>A.D. 1450-1500</strong>) sometimes 
              camped at abandoned villages. For the next four centuries the region 
              was temporary home to a colorful and often bloody succession of 
              human groups including nomadic hunting peoples, mounted Plains Indian 
              warrior societies, ciboleros (Mexican buffalo hunters), Comancheros 
              (Mexican traders), pastores (Mexican sheepherders) Anglo hide hunters, 
              and the U.S. Army, culminating in the <a href="../../redriver/index.html" class="text">Red 
              River War of 1874</a>. </p>
            <p class="text">Within two decades the Texas Panhandle was &#8220;permanently&#8221; 
              settled again, this time by Anglo ranchers and farmers. Like the 
              Plains villagers centuries earlier, these newcomers settled into 
              the valleys of the Canadian River and its tributaries and other 
              major streams such as Wolf Creek where water, wood, and resources 
              were concentrated. White settlers encountered the curious stone 
              ruins that abounded in the region and wondered who was responsible 
              for them. Old buffalo hunters had no idea, nor did the elders of 
              several Plains Indian tribes who became familiar with the region 
              in historic times. An Arapaho chief named Spotted Wolf is said to 
              have declared the ruins at Wolf Creek known today as Buried City 
              to be older than living memory and not even the work of Indians. 
              The ruined Plains villages of the Texas Panhandle had been lost 
              to history.</p>
            <p class="text">The first recorded observations of archeological remains 
              in the Texas Panhandle were made by United States Army officers 
              in the mid to late 1800s during military survey expeditions. In 
              1845, <strong>Lieutenant J. W. Abert </strong>visited and described 
              the massive stone-tool quarries known today as the <a href="../../alibates/index.html" class="text">Alibates 
              flint quarries</a>. Abert recognized abundant evidence of tool making 
              and called the area Agate Bluffs. He could not have known that for 
              over 13,000 years prehistoric groups had been making use of the 
              abundant and colorful stone found there or that Antelope Creek peoples 
              built several large villages in the vicinity to take advantage of 
              the useful and economically important resource. </p>
            <p class="text">On May 25, 1876, <strong>Lt. Thomas M. Woodruff</strong> 
              chanced upon an Antelope Creek house on a high hill overlooking 
              the Canadian Valley and conducted what historian T. Lindsay Baker 
              generously characterized as the &quot;first conscious excavation&quot; 
              of an archeological site in the Panhandle. Woodruff spied a space 
              about 12 feet square marked out by stones and thought it must be 
              a grave. &quot;After digging and scraping around with my sheath 
              knife I found several arrowheads of flint.&quot; Almost 80 years 
              later in late 1953, archeologists Jack Hughes and Floyd Studer spotted 
              what they believed may have been the same locality in Potter County 
              during an aerial reconnaissance. Hughes soon visited the site and 
              identified it as the remains of a Panhandle aspect (Antelope Creek) 
              slab house.</p>
            <p class="text">Woodruff's spontaneous digging is the first known 
              example of a pattern that continues to plague Panhandle archeology 
              to this day. Virtually every conspicuous Antelope Creek site has 
              been dug into repeatedly by casual curiosity seekers and determined 
              looters alike, many of the latter wielding shovels and picks and 
              causing great destruction. The lure of stone architecture seems 
              to be irresistible, even in face of the fact that virtually nothing 
              of significant commercial value is ever found in Antelope Creek 
              sites. The treasures to be found are the small things forgotten&#151;mainly 
              broken fragments and household trash&#8212;that, when properly studied, 
              can tell fascinating stories.</p>

                    </strong> </p>
                  <p class="text"><font size="2">In the 1880s, the ornithologist 
                    and naturalist George Bird Grinnell spent time among several 
                    Plains tribes, including the Pawnee, who adopted him into 
                    the tribe and called him White Wolf. Grinnell recorded several 
                    Pawnee origin stories including one known only to the very 
                    old men. Long ago, the elders said, the Pawnee and Wichita 
                    had lived in stone houses somewhere far to the southwest of 
                    the Missouri River in Nebraska where the Pawnee later lived. 
                    Archeologist Jack Hughes suggested that this tantalizing fragment 
                    from Pawnee oral tradition may refer to the Antelope Creek 
                    villages of the southern Plains. If so, it may be the last 
                    such memory known, marking the end of a living tradition of 
                    ancestral knowledge about the distant past of the Texas Panhandle.</font></p>
