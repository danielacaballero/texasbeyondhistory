            <div class="caption">The stone ruins on top of Landergin Mesa in Oldham 
              County long have attracted explorers, treasure seekers, and, finally, 
              serious researchers. The spectacular natural setting was chosen 
              by Antelope Creek villagers for its defensive value; there is no 
              source of water and no room for gardening atop the mesa. Villagers, 
              whose main houses and fields would have been down in the valleys, 
              are thought to have retreated here during times of conflict. Photo

                          of 1966 has given archeologists the opportunity to carry

                          most important part of any research project&#8212;the

                  <p class="text"> Since the 1960s, archeologists studying the 
                    Plains village sites of the Texas Panhandle and adjacent regions 
                    of the Southern Plains have struggled mightily to make sense 
                    of the variation that they and their predecessors have encountered. 
                    We have come to realize that Antelope Creek culture was a 
                    lot less uniform than earlier archeologists had believed. 
                    As is invariably the case with ancient cultures, the more 
                    we learn, the more we realize we still don't know.</p>
                  <p class="text">Earlier archeologists were drawn to the larger 
                    &quot;villages,&quot; like Antelope Creek 22 and Alibates 
                    28, that had visible structures arranged into pueblo-like 
                    blocks of houses. These now appear to be the exception rather 
                    than the rule. Even the larger Antelope Creek &quot;villages&quot; 
                    would have been home to only a few dozen people and could 
                    be more accurately called <strong>hamlets</strong>. These 
                    paled in comparison to the truly large, fortified prehistoric 
                    and historic villages in the Central and Northern Plains within 
                    which hundreds of people lived. In contrast, most Antelope 
                    Creek people seem to have lived in family groups in small 
                    hamlets and even smaller <strong>farmsteads</strong> with 
                    only one or two houses. </p>
                  <p class="text">Instead of a single tribe or ethnic group of 
                    closely related people, archeologists have found increasing 
                    evidence that various Plains Village groups co-exisited in 
                    different portions of the area we know today as the northern 
                    Texas Panhandle. It is still likely that most of the core 
                    area of the Antelope Creek culture along the Canadian River 
                    valley north of Amarillo was home to villagers who were closely 
                    related to one another, genetically and culturally. But not 
                    so far away there were other peoples, such as those who lived 
                    at Buried City, who probably belonged to different groups 
                    or tribes and perhaps spoke different languages (or at least 
                    different dialects). Increasingly, archeologists have found 
                    evidence of competition and conflict among Plains villagers 
                    and, perhaps, other less-settled peoples who found the villages/hamlets 
                    to be tempting targets. </p>
                  <p class="text">In this section we try to summarize the last 
                    40 years or so of archeological research in the region, knowing 
                    full well that there isn't any easy way to do this. Archeology 
                    is a lot more complicated today and involves many more people 
                    than it did in Floyd Studer's day.</p>

                  <p class="text">Since the mid-1960s American archeology has 
                    been transformed by the impact of federal and state laws intended 
                    to protect cultural resources such as the <strong>National 
                    Historic Preservation Act </strong>of 1966 and the <strong>Texas 
                    Antiquities Code </strong>of 1969. These laws require that 
                    archeological and historical sites on government land, and 
                    on private land being developed or disturbed with federal 
                    funding or by federal permit, be studied and evaluated before 
                    adverse impacts are allowed to take place. If an important 
                    archeological site lying in harm's way cannot be avoided and 
                    protected, then research is carried out through excavation 
                    or other means to preserve some of the information that makes 
                    the site important, thus &#8220;mitigating&#8221; the loss 
                    of information that the development will cause. One result 
                    of these laws has been a tremendous increase in funding for 
                    archeology and in the number of professional archeologists 
                    employed by universities, government agencies, and, increasingly, 
                    private industry. The industry that has developed because 
                    of state and federal historic preservation laws is called 
                    cultural resource management or <strong>CRM archeology</strong>.</p>
                  <p class="text">Compared to many other areas of the country 
                    and the state, the northern Texas Panhandle has seen only 
                    a modest increase in the amount of professional archeological 
                    research in recent decades. Most of the land remains in private 
                    hands and population densities remain comparatively low in 
                    most areas, hence federally or state regulated developments 
                    are few. Nonetheless, cultural resource laws have led to new 
                    research in the Antelope Creek area, especially on federally 
                    owned lands in the general vicinity of Lake Meredith including 
                    the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument, the Pantex 
                    Ammunitions Plant, and the Exell Helium Plant at the Cross 
                    Bar Ranch. Although some excavations have taken place, efforts 
                    to locate and evaluate archeological sites on federal lands 
                    have resulted in a better understanding of the settlement 
                    patterns of Antelope Creek villagers. Small hamlets and isolated 
                    farmhouses were, we now know, much more common than the larger 
                    pueblo-like ruins that attracted so much archeological and 
                    public attention for so long. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1973, <strong>William Marmaduke</strong> 
                    and <strong>Hayden Whitsett</strong> conducted an archaeological 
                    reconnaissance in east Oldham County in the western part of 
                    the Panhandle as a contribution to a &#8220;Natural Area Survey&#8221; 
                    of the Canadian Breaks. This state-funded project recorded 
                    49 archeological sites along Alamosa Creek and formally documented 
                    Landergin Mesa and Little Landergin Mesa, both important Antelope 
                    Creek sites. The resulting report highlighted the potential 
                    of the region&#8217;s natural and cultural resources to be 
                    protected and developed into regional attractions such as 
                    state parks.</p>
                  <p class="text">Federally funded highway work in the early 1970s 
                    led to the excavation of part of the <strong>Black Dog Village</strong> 
                    site, a large Antelope Creek settlement located at the confluence 
                    of Cottonwood and Tarbox creeks with the Canadian River north 
                    of Borger. Professional archeologists with the Texas Highway 
                    Department excavated five structures there, aided by Jack 
                    Hughes, Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum personnel, and volunteers 
                    from the Panhandle Archeological Society. While a large Antelope 
                    Creek structure dubbed the &#8220;Big House&#8221; attracted 
                    much attention, two pairs of small rooms lacking typical Antelope 
                    Creek house features were found that probably represent later 
                    occupations.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the 1970s, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 
                    conducted a number of archeological surveys at Lake Meredith. 
                    Archeologsits revisited the known sites and searched for unrecorded 
                    sites around the lake in order to assess (and lessen) impacts 
                    from public land use activities. Archeologists <strong>Meeks 
                    Etchieson</strong> and <strong>Jim Couzzourt</strong> surveyed 
                    the shore line during periods when the lake level was low 
                    and recorded 53 sites, few of them known from the earlier 
                    1961 survey. They also excavated slab-lined pits at two sites 
                    and conducted flotation and radiocarbon dating on the contents 
                    of these pits. Etchieson, a fulltime employee of the Bureau 
                    of Reclamation, also conducted other small surveys and damage 
                    assessments of tracts around the lake that were being impacted 
                    by off-road vehicle traffic. This led to the &#8220;salvage&#8221; 
                    excavation of several Antelope Creek houses. The results of 
                    such work are documented in technical reports that are part 
                    of what is often called the vast &#8220;gray&#8221; literature. 
                    While such reports are not intended for a public audience, 
                    they are an essential part of archeological research.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Etchieson was also instrumental in using archaeology 
                    as a training program and involved the <strong>Youth Conservation 
                    Corps</strong> in the testing and excavation of several sites at 
                    Lake Meredith. These include the South Ridge site, the Ozier 
                    site and a site on Plum Creek. The South Ridge site was used 
                    during Antelope Creek times and earlier periods as well and 
                    has been reported in full detail. The excavations at the two 
                    other sites were supervised by Etchieson and other archeologists, 
                    but have never been properly reported. It is difficult to 
                    complete research during training programs such as these, 
                    because they are geared chiefly toward excavation and preliminary 
                    artifact processing, not full analysis and reporting. This, 
                    of course, was the same problem faced by the WPA in the 1930s 
                    and early 1940s. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1982-83, the National Park Service and the 
                    Bureau of Reclamation funded two seasons of excavations at 
                    the <strong>Chicken Creek site</strong>. Riverbank erosion 
                    threatened this Antelope Creek site, where two small circular 
                    structures were found. The fieldwork was directed by <strong>Beverly 
                    Couzzourt</strong>, but the detailed results from only the 
                    first season have been reported. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1990, all lands at Lake Meredith, except 
                    some 700 acres of the dam axis and anchoring bluffs, were 
                    transferred from the Bureau of Reclamation to the<strong> 
                    National Park Service </strong>(NPS) jurisdiction. The changes 
                    in federal responsibilities have sparked more interest in 
                    surveys at Lake Meredith. Archeologists from the NPS Southwestern 
                    Regional Office have carried out evaluative testing on several 
                    Antelope Creek sites at Lake Meredith. Various private consulting 
                    firms have completed site inventory surveys on about half 
                    of the NPS property.</p>
                  <p class="text">Some of the intensive surveys have been conducted 
                    at the <strong>Alibates National Monument </strong>following 
                    natural range fires. For instance, a study conducted by <strong>Paul 
                    </strong>and <strong>Suzanna Katz </strong>under optimal surface 
                    visibility identified numerous sites and quarry pits within 
                    the monument boundaries. And other private and university 
                    contractors have carried out surveys of the Bureau of Reclamation's 
                    small property holdings adjacent to Sanford Dam.</p>
                  <p class="text">Just upstream from Lake Meredith, jurisdiction 
                    of the federal helium processing plant on the <strong>Cross 
                    Bar Ranch</strong> switched from the Office of Surface Mining 
                    to the Bureau of Land Management. Multiple archeological surveys 
                    of the ranch have been conducted, including the development 
                    of a predictive model of Antelope Creek site locations. These 
                    surveys found that villages were often established near pour-off 
                    plunge pools along secondary streams. These pool-side village 
                    sites are often miles away from the Canadian River and must 
                    have been linked to one another by trails. </p>
                  <H3>Landergin Mesa</H3>
                  <p class="text">In 1981, <strong>Robert Mallouf</strong>, then 
                    the State Archeologist of Texas, directed excavations at Landergin 
                    Mesa for the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The work was 
                    done to evaluate whether the site merited continued listing 
                    as a <strong>National Historic Landmark</strong>. The THC 
                    also sponsored additional excavations there in 1984 led by 
                    Christopher Lintz. This mesa-top Antelope Creek village had 
                    long attracted archeological attention because of its peculiar 
                    defensive location&#8212;Landergin Mesa has no immediate water 
                    source or nearby agricultural land.</p>
                  <p class="text">Like many prominent Antelope Creek ruins, the 
                    village atop the mesa had been badly disturbed by relic hunters. 
                    Funding for the THC archeological work was pieced together 
                    from federal, state, and private sources. Unfortunately, while 
                    there was enough money for the fieldwork, laboratory stabilization 
                    of records, photographs and specimens, and a few radiocarbon 
                    dates, a full analysis and reporting has not yet been accomplished. 
                    One of the enduring problems in archeology is that it is often 
                    very difficult to find adequate funding for the final and, 
                    ironically, most important part of any project&#8212;the hard 
                    work of thoroughly analyzing the recovered materials and fully 
                    reporting the results. </p>
                  <p class="text">The THC investigations showed that, despite 
                    extensive looting, substantial architecture and primary deposits 
                    remained intact in some areas of the site. Landergin Mesa 
                    was found to have had a long history of intermittent occupation 
                    beginning in Late Archaic and Woodland times. Most of the 
                    architecture (structural remains) dated to the Antelope Creek 
                    phase, during which the half-acre mesa top saw remarkably 
                    intense use. During the 1984 season, archeologists identified 
                    ten structures from seven different occupations within a relatively 
                    small excavation area covering 42 square meters (452 square 
                    feet). One odd finding was that most of the houses seem to 
                    have been built as isolated structures rather than the contiguous 
                    rooms one might expect given the severely limited real estate 
                    atop the mesa. The pattern of isolated-house construction 
                    existed throughout the duration of the Antelope Creek phase. 
                    Antelope Creek villagers apparently used Landergin Mesa as 
                    a refuge in threatening times rather than as a permanent village. 
                    A 2001 article by Lintz provides a useful summary of the excavated 
                    features and details of the dating of the site. </p>

                  <p class="text">Since the 1950s volunteers from archeological 
                    groups and student &#8220;volunteers&#8221; from regional 
                    universities have been involved in virtually all major excavations 
                    of Plains village sites in the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles.

                  <p class="text">The involvement of local archeological societies 
                    has been mentioned in the previous section as has the pivotal 
                    role played by Jack Hughes. In recent decades the <strong>Panhandle 
                    Archeological Society</strong> (PAS) has charted a different 
                    course from that taken by its predecessor group, the Norpan 
                    Archeological Society. The Norpan group, like many local societies, 
                    carried out many excavations on its own, few of which were 
                    ever completely analyzed and reported. In contrast, the PAS 
                    has focused on helping others and on publishing reports that 
                    have long languished in obscurity. PAS members routinely volunteer 
                    on field research projects run by professional archeologists 
                    and other established groups. Even more importantly, the PAS 
                    has published several other important archeological studies 
                    in addition to the Baker's WPA reports and Earl Green's report 
                    on the Footprint site.</p>
                  <p class="text">Field schools organized by statewide groups, 
                    the <strong>Texas Archeological Society</strong> (TAS), the 
                    <strong>Oklahoma Anthropological Society</strong>, and by 
                    various state universities have also been part of the story. 
                    While field schools are held primarily to provide training, 
                    important research can also be accomplished.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1969, the TAS held its eighth annual field 
                    school along <strong>Blue Creek</strong>, a tributary of the 
                    Canadian, on National Park Service property near Lake Meredith. 
                    <strong>Jack Hughes</strong> directed the week-long investigations 
                    of four Antelope Creek sites by over 200 volunteers from across 
                    the state. Three of the sites were hamlets or small villages 
                    while the fourth was a small cemetery where children and infants 
                    were buried. While TAS field schools are positive learning 
                    experiences, 200 people can move a lot of dirt in a week and 
                    create small mountains of artifacts and field records. Hughes 
                    never found time to study the Blue Creek finds. Fortunately, 
                    two of his former students, <strong>Jim Couzzourt</strong> 
                    and <strong>Beverly Schmidt-Couzzourt</strong>, took on the 
                    project in the 1980s. Their detailed report finally appeared 
                    in 1996, an accomplishment that few non-archeologists could 
                    appreciate &#8212; successfully completing such a project 
                    years after the fieldwork is finished is an extraordinarily 
                    difficult feat. </p>
                  <p class="text">The TAS field school returned to the northern 
                    Panhandle in 1987 and 1988 as part of new investigations of 
                    <strong>Buried City</strong>. This time it was Jack Hughes&#8217; 
                    son, <strong>David Hughes</strong>, who directed the work. 
                    David, who now teaches at Wichita State University (WSU) in 
                    Kansas, led new work at Buried City on behalf of the Harold 
                    Courson family beginning in 1985 and 1986. The 1987 and 1988 
                    TAS field schools were even larger than the one at Blue Creek. 
                    Hughes also ran a WSU field school at Buried City in 1990. 
                    The results of the Buried City work are presented elsewhere 
                    on this website (see <a href="../buriedcity/investigations.html" class="text">Buried 
                    City Investigations</a>). </p>
                  <p class="text">In 2000, <strong>Scott Brosowske</strong> of 
                    the University of Oklahoma (OU) began investigating new areas 
                    in the Buried City vicinity using remote sensing techniques. 
                    In the summer of 2003, an OU field school excavated several 
                    pithouse structures Brosowske located. </p>

                    students who have studied Plains Villager sites in the Texas 
                    Panhandle and nearby areas. Dozens of students working on 
                    advanced degrees or participating in specialized research 
                    studies at universities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and elsewhere 
                    have contributed to what we know about Antelope Creek culture. 
                    As is the case in many fields of study, most of the master&#8217;s 
                    theses and dissertations written by archeology graduate students 
                    are never formally published. This is unfortunate, because 
                    many such studies are in-depth analyses that have significant

                  <H3>Antelope Creek Paleoecology</H3>
                  <p class="text">In the mid 1960s, two scientists from Wisconsin, 
                    archeologist <strong>David A. Baerreis</strong> and climatologist 
                    <strong>Reid A. Bryson</strong>, published a series of articles 
                    advancing a fascinating hypothesis that, in part, might explain 
                    the origin of Antelope Creek culture. Using climatic data 
                    and newly obtained radiocarbon dates from Antelope Creek sites, 
                    they argued that deteriorating climatic conditions in the 
                    central Plains about A.D. 1200 had caused Upper Republican 
                    peoples to move south from Nebraska to the Oklahoma and Texas 
                    panhandles shortly thereafter. While a central Plains origin 
                    for Antelope Creek had been postulated in the 1930s by Wedel 
                    and reinforced by Krieger and then Watson, Baerreis and Bryson 
                    were the first to provide a clear mechanism and supporting 
                    evidence. Their work was the first time that Antelope Creek 
                    paleoecology, the biological study of ancient organisms (humans 
                    included) and their environment, had been seriously considered. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Inspired by this work, <strong>Lathel F. Duffield</strong>, 
                    a graduate student under Baerreis at the University of Wisconsin, 
                    decided to undertake a detailed analysis of the faunal materials 
                    (animal bones) recovered from 11 Antelope Creek sites. Duffield 
                    obtained collections from the three sites he had excavated 
                    in 1962 at Sanford Reservoir as well as a series of other 
                    sites including Antelope Creek 22, Alibates 28, and Sanford 
                    Ruin. His 1970 dissertation remains a critical source of information 
                    on Antelope Creek diet, hunting patterns, and paleoecology. 
                    For instance, he identified 38 species of mammals, 29 birds, 
                    8 reptiles, and 2 fish among the bones he studied, clearly 
                    showing that Antelope Creek peoples relied on far more than 
                    buffalo. To be sure, bison was the most important species 
                    at all the sites he studied, but Duffield&#8217;s data suggested 
                    that there had been a drying trend during Antelope Creek times 
                    that by A.D. 1300 resulted in fewer bison and more antelope. 
                    Was this trend a factor in the demise of Antelope Creek culture?</p>
                  <p><span class="text">Recently, <strong>Majorie Duncan</strong> 
                    has completed her dissertation at the University of Oklahoma 
                    on a detailed ecological study of the animal bones from the 
                    Two Sisters homestead site in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The 
                    <strong>Two Sisters site</strong> is thought to be a small 
                    homestead occupied by a single Plains Village family over 
                    a lengthy period of time. Duncan&#8217;s study relies on contrasting 
                    the bone assemblages from two superimposed houses occupied 
                    between A.D. 1300 and 1450 that presumably represent continued 
                    site occupation by successive generations. In addition to 
                    providing a comprehensive description of the site and its 
                    material assemblage, she documents the use of 15 species of 
                    identifiable mammals, 10 species of reptiles, one amphibian 
                    species, 15 bird species, three fish species, and one mussel 
                    species. Based on ranking the importance of various prey and 
                    studies of long-term resource depletion, Duncan presents a 
                    fascinating model of how the site may have been abandoned. 
                    She reasons that the work of acquiring food became too difficult 
                    following environmental deterioration</span> <span class="text">(increasingly 
                    drier conditions) and the immediate area could no longer be 
                    effectively farmed, forcing the family to move elsewhere for 
                    survival. </span></p>
                  <H3>Apishapa   and Antelope Creek Phases</H3>
                  <p class="text">In the late 1960s <strong>Robert Campbell</strong> 
                    completed his doctoral research at the University of Colorado 
                    on the Chaquaqua Plateau of southeastern Colorado. There he 
                    found evidence of a Plains village group who were responsible 
                    for what he called the <strong>Apishapa  phase. </strong>Apishapa  
                    peoples built circular houses with stone foundations and Campbell 
                    proposed they were the ancestors and originators of Antelope 
                    Creek culture. He expanded this idea in his 1976 book, <em>The 
                    Panhandle Aspect of the Chaquaqua Plateau</em>. Campbell argued 
                    that around A.D. 1200, the Apishapa  Plains villagers were 
                    forced to migrate as the result of a prolonged drought. They 
                    moved, he argued, south and east into the Canadian River valley, 
                    bringing with them their knowledge of stone masonry. In the 
                    Texas Panhandle, they came in contact with late Woodland peoples 
                    who were already living in rectangular subterranean houses. 
                    According to Campbell, the mix of cultures resulted in the 
                    typical Antelope Creek houses with stone foundations. </p>
                  <p class="text">Two years after the publication of Campbell's 
                    book, his migration theory drew a withering critique from 
                    a graduate student, <strong>Christopher R. Lintz</strong>. 
                    In a 1978 paper called &quot;Architecture and Radiocarbon 
                    Dating of the Antelope Creek Focus: A Test of Campbell's Model,&quot; 
                    Lintz argued that his own appraisal of Antelope Creek radiocarbon 
                    dates suggested that the Apishapa and Antelope Creek cultures 
                    were contemporaneous rather than successive. (Today the issue 
                    is being debated again -- see <a href="../hank2/index.html" class="text">Hank's 
                    House 2</a>.) </p>
                  <p class="text">Lintz, in essence, had taken up the task of 
                    defining Antelope Creek culture where Alex Krieger left off 
                    over three decades earlier. Lintz had been introduced to the 
                    subject in the early 1970s as a young graduate student at 
                    the University of Oklahoma (OU). He took part in two OU field 
                    schools held at Plains Village sites in the Oklahoma Panhandle, 
                    the first in 1972 at the <strong>McGrath site</strong> and 
                    the second the following year at the Two Sisters site. Lintz 
                    wrote up the McGrath site for his 1975 master&#8217;s degree. 
                    His interest in the region grew in the 1970s and early 1980s 
                    while he worked on various contract projects and continued 
                    his graduate studies.</p>
                  <p class="text">For his dissertation research, Lintz critically 
                    reexamined many aspects of Antelope Creek culture, focusing 
                    on the small core area centered on a 50-mile stretch of the 
                    Canadian Valley north and northeast of Amarillo. Lintz had 
                    two key advantages over Krieger. First, of course, he was 
                    able to incorporate the results of three more decades of research, 
                    a period during which radiocarbon dating had become an important 
                    tool. Secondly, Lintz devoted a great deal more time to the 
                    project than Krieger had been able to and was able to track 
                    down many primary field records and unpublished manuscripts 
                    as well as published accounts. His 1984 dissertation (formally 
                    published in 1986) is a critical source on Antelope Creek 
                    culture. Lintz has also published numerous articles and reports 
                    on Antelope Creek sites and related research topics.</p>
                  <p class="text">Lintz reaffirmed the validity of the Antelope 
                    Creek concept, redefining it as the <strong>Antelope Creek 
                    phase</strong> within what he called the <strong>Upper Canark 
                    variant</strong> of the Plains Village tradition. Practically 
                    speaking, the Upper Canark variant is a slightly expanded 
                    version of what Krieger called the <strong>Panhandle aspect</strong>. 
                    As you might expect, given the provincial nature of most archeological 
                    research, the new variant name has found favor among Oklahoma 
                    and Colorado archeologists. Equally unsurprising is the fact 
                    that Texas archeologists rarely use the term, if for no other 
                    reason than because of its awkward construction (Upper Canark 
                    = upper drainage systems of the Canadian and Arkansas rivers).</p>
                  <p class="text"><span class="text">Among Lintz&#8217; contributions 
                    are these five accomplishments: (1) he classified cultural 
                    variation in Plains Village life across the western half of 
                    the southern Plains; (2) he revised the chronology of Antelope 
                    Creek; (3) he recognized that the extreme diversity others 
                    had perceived in Antelope Creek architectural form represented 
                    mainly variation on a relatively simple set of basic functional 
                    forms; (4) he marshaled considerable data in support of plausible 
                    explanations of the origin, development, social organization, 
                    and demise of Antelope Creek culture; and (5) he offered an 
                    improved explanation of the interaction between Antelope Creek 
                    villagers and Pueblo peoples to the southwest. </span></p>
                  <p class="text">Lintz compiled the available dating clues and 
                    carefully reviewed the chronology of Antelope Creek and defined 
                    two subphases, an early one (A.D. 1200-1350) and a late one 
                    (A.D 1350-1500), thus pushing back Krieger&#8217;s dates by 
                    over a century. Rejecting the Upper Republican origins postulated 
                    by Baerreis and Bryson, Lintz embraced Jack Hughes&#8217; 
                    argument that Antelope Creek was a local development that 
                    had its origins in the area&#8217;s earlier Woodland and Late 
                    Archaic cultures. (While the &quot;local origins&quot; hypothesis 
                    is still considered viable today, it has yet to be supported 
                    by solid evidence.) </p>
                  <p class="text">The architectural variation long noted among 
                    Antelope Creek and related Plains Village sites had befuddled 
                    archeologists for decades. Lintz argued that many of the differences 
                    were superficial and were attributable more to the availability 
                    of building materials (or engineering constraints due to room 
                    sizes) and, especially, to the failure of archeologists to 
                    fully expose and understand Antelope Creek architecture. He 
                    defined two dominant forms of basic residential units&#8212;houses&#8212;as 
                    well as several types of &#8220;subordinate structures&#8221; 
                    representing storage rooms, work rooms, cooking areas, and 
                    other specialized-function areas. </p>
                  <p class="text">At most Antelope Creek sites, particularly the 
                    multi-room &#8220;pueblos,&#8221; subordinate structures outnumber 
                    the actual houses and have caused some researchers to overestimate 
                    the number of people who had lived there. The archeological 
                    attention lavished on the so-called &quot;pueblos&quot; in 
                    the 1920s-1940s created the false impression that these were 
                    archetypical Antelope Creek &quot;village&quot; sites. In 
                    fact, these appear to be exceptional sites that only occur 
                    in a small area and they are are far outnumbered by smaller 
                    sites with isolated or paired houses and subordinate structures.</p>
                  <p class="text">Antelope Creek sites that have architectural 
                    remains, Lintz said, could be divided into three categories: 
                    hamlets, homesteads, and subhomesteads. (Some site types, 
                    like rock art sites, butchering locales, and flint quarries, 
                    do not have structures.) Even the largest sites, such as Antelope 
                    Creek 22, were really not villages, but <strong>hamlets </strong>where 
                    no more than eight families had lived. <strong>Homesteads 
                    </strong>were smaller sites with one main house and various 
                    subordinate structures where a single family had lived. <strong>Subhomesteads</strong> 
                    were sites with subordinate structures but no main houses 
                    and probably were seasonal farmsteads or other limited use 
                    areas. </p>
                  <p class="text">In early Antelope Creek times, most people lived 
                    in hamlets, including the famed &#8220;pueblos&#8221; with 
                    continuous rooms as well as the more common clusters of individual 
                    houses and subordinate structures. But by late Antelope Creek 
                    times, most people lived in homesteads, a change Lintz thought 
                    was caused by increasing drought and the difficulty of finding 
                    enough resources to sustain larger social groups. Another 
                    early to late change was a statistically dramatic increase 
                    in the amount of traded pottery and other items from the Rio 
                    Grande Pueblos to the southwest. Greater trade and interaction 
                    after A.D. 1300 was, he argued, a response to less predictable 
                    climatic conditions for farming. In a subsequent study Lintz 
                    also documented the unusual existence of true mound construction 
                    at Alibates Ruin 28, where a mound at least four feet tall 
                    with some kind of elevated structure atop was constructed 
                    during late Antelope Creek times. </p>
                  <p> Sophisticated explanations of complex social phenomena, 
                    like Antelope Creek life, are complicated and must take into 
                    consideration many factors. Lintz did not simply make assertions 
                    and offer &quot;just-so&quot; stories; instead he presented 
                    supporting data ranging from radiocarbon dates, plant and 
                    animal identifications, artifact counts, room size calculations, 
                    feature distributions and so on. His comparative regional 
                    analysis of hard evidence is exactly the sort of scientific 
                    study that had been sorely lacking in Antelope Creek studies 
                    for so long. Lintz&#8217; work was a much-needed synthesis 
                    and new interpretation of Antelope Creek life upon which other 
                    researchers will be building (and picking apart) for many 
                    more decades.</p>
                  <H3>Recent Developments</H3>
                  <p class="text">It is hard to make proper sense of any recent 
                    history simply because we are too close to the events and 
                    personalities. In archeology, for instance, years and even 
                    decades can go by between excavation and final publication 
                    and between the productive career peaks of leading authorities 
                    and their successors. </p>
                  <p>The small archeological community of the northern Texas Panhandle 
                    is still in transition following the death of Jack Hughes 
                    in 2001. Hughes left an unequaled legacy of students and friends 
                    whose involvement in archeology he inspired. He also left 
                    behind many systematic artifact collections and supporting 
                    documentation from many Antelope Creek sites. As in many areas 
                    of the state, much unglamorous work remains to be done to 
                    tap the potential of these important collections. </p>
                  <p>Happily, there are positive developments underway. Government-sponsored 
                    and government-mandated archeological research will continue 
                    to provide new opportunities. Landowners such as <strong>Harold 
                    Courson </strong>(Buried City), <strong>John Erickson</strong> 
                    (northern Roberts County), and <strong>Pete Thurmond </strong>(Dempsey 
                    Divide in western Oklahoma) are devoting their own time and 
                    resources to learning more about the history of their land. 
                    Veteran professional and avocational archeologists, many of 
                    them Jack&#8217;s formers students, continue to be interested 
                    in the archeology of the region, even those who have moved 
                    away. For instance, Panhandle natives <strong>Doug Boyd</strong> 
                    and <strong>Brett Cruise</strong> are professional archeologists 
                    who have been returning to the region to help Erickson investigate 
                    a little known area of the Canadian River Valley. Members 
                    of the Panhandle Archeological Society, the TAS and the THC&#8217;s 
                    stewardship network, such as <strong>Rolla Shaller</strong>, 
                    <strong>Alvin Lynn, </strong>and<strong> Doug Wilkens</strong> 
                    (among others), are involved in almost every field project 
                    in the region. Graduate students from various universities 
                    including the University of Oklahoma, Wichita State University, 
                    the University of Texas at San Antonio, and Texas A&amp;M, 
                    are analyzing old Antelope Creek collections and undertaking 
                    new research. Scott Brosowske&#8217;s work at Buried City 
                    and other sites exemplifies the contributions that graduate 
                    students are making. Finally, we note that Oklahoma professional 
                    archeologists, such as <strong>Richard Drass</strong> and 
                    <strong>Robert Brooks</strong> at OU, are studying Plains 
                    Village and Woodland cultures in western and southern Oklahoma 
                    that offer close comparisons with the villagers of the Texas 
                    Panhandle.</p>
