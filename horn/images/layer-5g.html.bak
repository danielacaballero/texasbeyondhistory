    <td width="480" valign="top"><h3>Sub-Stratum 5G: Upper member—heavy gray</h3>
      
      
        <p>Substratum 5G is a very dark, midden-like cave deposit, which  has been considerably dirtied by human living. Its interface with the underlying Sub-Stratum 5F is indistinct, distinguished chiefly by darker gray color. </p>
        <p>Of particular significance in Sub-Stratum 5G was the discovery of the double grave of an adult male and a juvenile. The two had been interred with an array of unusual items in a relatively shallow pit that extended or had been dug in from this surface into the underlying deposits. At the time of investigations, the top of the grave was not detected by excavators. Details about this important feature are presented in the section,<a href="../burials.html">  A Paleoindian  Grave.</a></p>
        <p>This layer represents the heaviest  occupation in the Paleoindian levels of the shelter, containing large amounts  of chipped-stone tools, including  fluted points termed &quot;Brazos Fishtail,&quot; animal bone and other debris, and several fire hearths. </p>
        <p>Overall, the comparatively greater quantity of tools and  other debris found in this stratum may indicate either a longer stay or  successive occupations by people, rather than a larger number of people  overall, given the small size of the shelter. </p>
        <p>This sub-stratum has four radiocarbon dates from samples taken at the time of excavations, two from  charcoal and two from snail shell. Two different dating agents were used as a  cross check. The dates are as follows: 9500 +/- 130 years B.P. (Tx-1830  wood charcoal); 10,030+/- 130 years b.P. (Tx-1998 snail shells); 9980 +/- 370 years  B.P (Tx-1722 wood charcoal);&nbsp; 10,310 +/- 150  years B.P (Tx-1997 snail shells).  </p>
        <p>Two additional dates, obtained by the Smithsonian Institution on fragments of human skeletal bone from the Horn  Shelter burial are in close correspondence to the assays  reported earlier: uncalibrated AMS date for the adult is reported as 9710+/-40 years B.P. (CAMS-60681); for the juvenile, 9690+/-50 years B.P. (CAMS-51794). </p>
        <p>Although there were a number of hearth features in this  stratum, some may have been disturbed by successive activities of the occupants  over a period of time. Overall, the hearth features were typical of the other Paleoindian  levels: areas of dark or charcoal-stained soil where the inhabitants had made  fires directly on the ground, without the use of rocks.&nbsp; More than 70 pounds  of soil from the features was screened and washed, and &nbsp;a quantity of small animal bones and flint  debris from toolmaking recovered.<u></u></p>
        <p>Other than the materials found within the grave, the  Sub-Stratum 5G assemblage includes a large number of stone tools and fragments  including projectile points, bifaces, drills, gravers, unifaces, quartzite  choppers, burins, utilized flakes, hammerstones, and debitage. Red ocher  fragments also were present. A large quantity of animal bone was recovered,  some of it worked, crushed, and/or burned. Remains of small mammals were the  most prevalent including rabbits, voles, rodents, birds, frogs, turtles,  snakes, fish, and freshwater mussels. Deer and a few bison bones also were  recovered. </p>
        <p>Projectile points include two  points termed &quot;Brazos Fishtail,&quot;possibly a variant of San Patrice; the base of probable Wilson (which refits with the distal portion found in the underlying Sub-Stratum 5F); and two  unclassified points. One of these likely is a Brazos, or San Patrice, blade section, the  other is a heavily resharpened side-notched point with concave base. The latter  specimen (see artifact plate at top left) has been heavily beveled along both blade margins, apparently having been recycled  for use as a scraper-tool. Archeologist Dee Ann Story notes that this specimen exhibits technological similarities to  Albany knives and &quot;spokeshaves&quot;  found in sites with San Patrice dart points in East Texas and Louisiana. </p>
        <p>Basal grinding on the &quot;Brazos Fishtail&quot; points  is more pronounced along  the tang lateral edges, but ranging from moderate to almost none on the basal concavity. Fluting is accomplished by the removal from both sides  of several long narrow longitudinal flakes; on one, fluting extends half the  total length of the point. This point appears similar to the &quot;Side-Hollowed&quot; points from the Rex Rogers site in the Texas Panhandle and the Green type from Florida, both of Paleoindian age. </p>
        <p>Among the tools, gravers are often multiple pointed and  frequently made on one end or side of a scraper. The tips are generally short  and strong. Drills are large and heavy though very finely made, except one  specimen that has a   thick, almost round, cross section.&nbsp; The proximal ends are broken from the other  two large specimens. Neither appears to have been made on broken darts or  knives. &nbsp;</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="480" valign="top"><p>A large number of unifacial tools, termed here as scrapers, were  recovered from Sub-Stratum 5G. These materials were so numerous and varied that Frank Watt initially described their prehistoric makers as the &quot;Crude Scraper Culture.&quot;</p>
      <p>The tools were made on convenient flakes struck from  cobbles, usually with no deliberate chipping to produce a symmetrically shaped  tool.&nbsp;Often these are combination tools,  that is, combining a notch or graver.&nbsp;  The bit edges  are mostly obtuse; a few have acute  angles and may have been used for other purposes such as knives for cutting. Although all are unfacial, some had edge detailing on opposite sides.  </p>
      <p>For an article in the 1985 <em>Central Texas Archeologist</em>, Redder analyzed and classified a total of 53 scrapers from this  stratum   with a nomenclature after that used  for analysis of scrapers from the Acton  site in Hood County, Texas. He noted that, interestingly, scrapers from Horn shelter also easily fall into the  system used by Francois Bordes in his 1972 publication, <em>A Tale of Two Caves </em>(Harper and Row), focused on findings at middle Paleolithic sites in France. The Sub-Stratum 5G scraper assemblage, as described in the 1985 article, includes: </p>
      <p><strong>Side scrapers.</strong>&nbsp; Scrapers with the working edge along one side of the long axis of the flake on  which it was made (7 specimens: all with cortex, 3 with gravers).  <strong>Transverse scrapers</strong>. Scrapers  with a working edge similar to an end scraper, that is on the edge opposite the  percussion bulb, but wider than it is long (7 specimens: 4 with cortex). <strong> Concave scrapers.</strong>&nbsp;  The working edge is a long shallow concavity,  but not a notch.&nbsp; One specimen has two  concave edges. ( 8 specimens: 6 with cortex, 2 with gravers.&nbsp;)&nbsp;<strong>Multiple edge scrapers.</strong> A scraper with a dual working  edge, separated into three sub-types.&nbsp;  Sub-type A. &nbsp;&nbsp;11 specimens: 1 with  graver.&nbsp; Has at least two working edges  but may have more, and does not fit the next two subtypes. Sub-type  B.&nbsp; 5 specimens: 1 with a graver.&nbsp; Has two straight working edges forming an  angle of 50 to 70 degrees, coming to a rounded  working end at the distal tip.&nbsp; This  scraper is narrow across the distal end, and wide at the proximal end. The  percussion bulb is on this end. Sub-Type C. 4 specimens.&nbsp; A long narrow scraper with a working edge all  along one side with the distal end coming to a rounded working end, similar to  type B.&nbsp; The opposite long edge is  unused. One specimen has a concave-convex working edge.&nbsp; Not listed with concave scrapers.  &nbsp; <strong>Oblique scrapers</strong>.&nbsp;Scrapers with one working edge at about 45 degrees to the long axis of the flake (5 specimens: 4 with cortex, 2 with gravers).&nbsp;<strong>Notch  scrapers.</strong> Scrapers having a small deep notch about 0.19 to 0.5 inches across (3 specimens: 2 with cortex, 1 specimen with a graver and side  scraper.&nbsp; Not listed under side scrapers).   <strong>Miscellaneous scrapers.</strong> Scrapers that do not readily conform to the above  classifications (6 specimens: 5  with cortex, 1 with graver). <strong>Scraper on a biface</strong>. &nbsp;This is a small biface that  has been used along the lateral edges for scraping (1  specimen). <strong>Broken scraper fragments</strong>. Apparently fragments that have been broken from scrapers while being  used. These appear to be the smaller fragments (5  specimens: 3 with cortex, 1 with graver).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Among the many intriguing finds in this layer, the large number of unifaces sparks questions about how the tools were used and on what products.  Whether the numbers of tools correlate  to longer periods of stay,  more intensive exploitation of a particular food, merits inquiry, or to successive occupations by groups using similar tools, will be an interesting issue for further study. </p>
