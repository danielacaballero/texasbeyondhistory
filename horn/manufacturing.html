<p><em><strong>Hook Stock: </strong></em> Any bone fragment on which a fishhook is to be made.  However unless a little preliminary work was begun, it is not possible to say that a bone of satisfactory dimensions was intended to be used as raw material for a hook. </p>

<p><strong><em>Proximal Stock Remnant</em>: </strong> That part of the stock likely used as a handle while cutting the hook to shape.  It becomes a remnant after the hook is completed and has been removed. </p>

<p><strong><em>Distal Stock Remnant or Basal Tab</em>: </strong> That part of the stock that is removed from the base of the hook, in preparation for rounding the hook base and shaping the point.  This basal tab may not always be present since they are rare in this complex.  Both the proximal stock remnant and the basal tab may be used for another hook if they are large enough. </p>

<p><strong><em>Fishhook – the finished artifact</em>: </strong>A part of the hook is the shank, that long portion to which the fishing line is attached.  This is the proximal end.  It may be straight, flared, or knobbed and with or without line grooves encircling it. The base is that rounded part between the lower shank and the point.  The point is that part by which the fish is impaled. </p>

      <p>Among the thousands of  animal bone fragments and  chipped-stone flakes found in the Archaic  zones at Horn Shelter were certain distinctive materials that caught the eye of investigator Albert Redder. After weeks of sorting  bone and debitage collections followed by careful microscopic study, Redder began to recognize the products and byproducts of a bone fishhook  manufacturing industry, including the tiny  chert flakes  used as fabricating tools.</p>
      <p>With these materials, the avocational archeologist has painstakingly traced the likely steps of Archaic craftsman, from the selection and first shaping of raw material to  completion of finished fishhooks.      Redder's explanation of this technology, below, is drawn largely from his 1985 article  first published in the <em>Central Texas Archeologist</em>.</p>
      <h3>From Deer Bone to Fishhook </h3>
      <p>Fishhooks at Horn Shelter No. 2 were made almost exclusively from fragments  of the leg bones of a deer. 
        The bone fragments for hook stocks were obtained by breaking  the leg bones; whether this was to secure marrow or only to make a hook has not been  determined. </p>
      <p>After a suitable stock had been chosen, a hole was scraped  through the bone from the outside. This  hole was then enlarged until the inside dimensions necessary for a hook were  obtained. At this point, the basal tab  was likely removed. This was  accomplished by cutting a groove across the stock at the base of the hook and  breaking off the tab. Work continued by  rounding up the base (some hooks show evidence of abrasions in shaping the  base; others do not) and generally shaping up the hook, forming the point and  freeing it from the stock. At this time,  encircling line grooves were probably cut if they were desired. One broken hook and stock shows the line  grooves cut before the hook was freed from its stock. </p>
      <p>At this point the hook was virtually  complete. However, it was still attached  to the stock. It was removed by cutting  two grooves on each side of the bone where the end of the shank was to be and  breaking the hook free. The workman then  held in one hand a completed hook, and in the other a proximal stock  remnant. This remnant may have been  discarded or used to make another hook if it was large enough. Three proximal stock fragments and one basal stock show evidence of having been used to make  more hooks. </p>
      <p>A total of 33 specimens of fishhook material was recovered  from Horn Shelter No. 2, south unit. Most are from  the midden, Stratum 10, although several are from other Archaic strata. Nine specimens represent hooks broken and  incomplete. Twenty-four specimens  represent fragments remaining after the hook has been completed. Two  charcoal samples from Stratum 10 were submitted for radiocarbon assay.  The first, associated with bone hooks as well as Pedernales dart points, yielded a date of 3470+/-160 B.P. (TX-1720). The second, associated with Marcos points, was dated to 2330+/-60 (TX-1999).</p>
      <p>Although fishhook material has been found throughout the  area, it is not common in any one site.  In the Lake Whitney Reservoir, hooks and stock have been found at the  Kyle site, the Pictograph Shelter, Buzzard Shelter, Sheep Shelter, and Little  Buzzard Shelter. From nearby areas other  hooks have been found. One hook was from  a shelter on a small tributary on the Leon  River near Oglesby,  Texas; one hook was from a shelter on a small  tributary of the North Bosque River  near Crawford, Texas;  one hook was from a shelter on Stampede Creek near Lake  Belton; and another hook was from a  shelter on Hog Creek near Crawford,   Texas. From Horn Shelter 1 a possible hook, broken, was made  from a mussel shell, and three hooks were made from the leg or wing bone of a  large bird.        &nbsp;Others may have been found in other sites.</p>
      <h3>Hook-making Tools </h3>
      <p>In the process of excavating the Archaic midden at Horn Shelter and the finding of  bone fishhook materials, the question arose, what kind of tool was used to make  these hooks? It was obvious that snubnose  scrapers or other large scrapers could not have been used to shape the small  inside curve of these hooks. In  addition, practically no large scrapers were found. After much discussion with Frank Watt and analysis  of used flakes, a pattern began to emerge. </p>
      <p>Certain flakes that were triangular in form, with a used edge generally  along one side, had on this edge near the small end a small notch. This notch varied from 1/8 inch across to  slightly larger and from shallow to as deep as the width. Theoretically, these tools would work  admirably, rounding out the inside portion of the hook as well as shaping up  the outside and freeing the point. It has not been satisfactorily decided what tool was used to start  the process by cutting the first hole through a bone, but a short stout graver  would have worked well. </p>
      <p>At least eighteen utilized flakes from the midden appear to have been &ldquo;fishhook-making tools.&rdquo; Similar notched  flakes are not found in the Paleoindian assemblages. Utilized flake material from other sites having a fishhook  component needs to be analyzed to see if this type of hook-making tool is  present, and the assemblage checked against sites not having fishhooks.</p>
      <p>  Based on the amount of bone hook fragments and the apparent flake tools used for their manufacture at Horn Shelter, one thing is apparent &ndash;  fishing was an important industry at this time and place. Large quantites of fish bones, including gar, freshwater drum, and channel catfish also were recovered in the Archaic levels, providing us an indication of the variety of fish  sought by the Archaic anglers. Although some may may have been caught in nets, we can surmise that  the fishermen caught a number of these  using their intricate bone tackle. </p>
