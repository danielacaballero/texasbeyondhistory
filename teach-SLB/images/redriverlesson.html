      <p class="text"><strong> Lesson Title: </strong> Whose Buffalo? </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade Level: </strong> 7th </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Rationale: </strong> This two-part lesson deals with events on the Great Plains of Texas leading up to the Red River War of 1874. Students will examine how the Plains Indians vied with white commercial buffalo hunters for the millions of Great Plains buffalo, and will create an illustrated broadside supporting the interests of either the Indians or the commercial hunters.</p>

     <p class="text"><strong> Activity &ndash; Part I: The debate: Whose buffalo? - Gathering information and using prewriting strategies </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text"> Step 1: Show the Great Plains map transparency. Explain that in the early 1800s there were 50-60 million buffalo roaming the Great Plains, but by 1890 the number had fallen to 750 and the animals were in danger of becoming extinct. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="text"> Step 2: Show the Great Plains buffalo transparency and ask students if they&rsquo;ve ever seen a real buffalo. Explain that in the 1870s two groups vied for the right to kill as many of these animals as they wished: the Plains Indians and white commercial buffalo hunters. In the 1870s, each side had supporters who hotly debated the &ldquo;Whose buffalo?&rdquo; issue. Advise students that they will gather information about both sides, then choose one side or the other to support. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="text"> Step 3: Distribute the &ldquo;Whose Buffalo&rdquo; graphic organizer to students. Show the transparency of the graphic organizer on the overhead projector. Explain to students that before deciding which side (the Indians or commercial hunters) they choose to support, they will gather at least 5 facts supporting <strong>each</strong> side, using a fact sheet and online exhibits at the Texas Beyond History website. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="text"> Step 4: Distribute the &ldquo;Whose Buffalo?&rdquo; fact sheet. Let students work with a partner to read the fact sheet and list arguments on each side of the graphic organizer. </li>
      </ul>
     <ul>
        <li class="text"> Step 5: Advise students that after they have read and gathered facts from the fact sheet they may search for further arguments on the following websites: </li>
  </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="text"> How many ways can you use a buffalo?<br>
        <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/buffalo.html" class="text">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/buffalo.html</a></p>

      </blockquote>
      <p class="text"><strong> Activity &ndash; Part II: Creating a Broadside </strong></p>
      <p class="text"> Step 1: Remind students that in Part I of this lesson, they identified arguments for the rights of both the Plains Indians and the commercial buffalo hunters. In Part II of the lesson, students will take a stand supporting the rights of either the Indians or the commercial hunters. </p>
      <p class="text"> Step 2: Introduce broadsides by asking students to discuss what forms of media they use to get their news. List their responses. Point out that in the 1870s there were no televisions, radios, or Internet reports, and while newspapers were available in some towns and cities, it was the posting of broadsides that allowed people to express their political or social ideas in public. Explain that the broadside was an inexpensively produced early form of mass media that was usually printed on one sheet of paper, and often contained illustrations and short songs or poems that could help get the author&rsquo;s message across to the public. They were generally posted in stores windows or other public places. </p>
      <p class="text"> Step 3: Advise students that in this part of the lesson they will work in a group to produce a broadside defending their chosen side of the &ldquo;Whose buffalo?&rdquo; debate. Distribute copies of the &ldquo;Whose buffalo?&rdquo; grading criteria to students and place a transparency of the grading criteria on the overhead. Go over it with students. </p>
      <p class="text"> Step 4: Have students get into groups of 3 or 4, letting them choose group mates who share the argument they want to put forth in their broadside. Advise students they will need to consult the &ldquo;Whose Buffalo?&rdquo; grading criteria and divide up the work of creating their broadside among their group members. </p>
      <p class="text"> Step 5: Distribute supplies necessary for creation of the 
        broadsides and allow the rest of the class period for students to produce 
        their broadsides. </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Modification: </strong></p>
      <p class="text"> Highlight pertinent information in the fact sheet for transfer to the graphic organizer. </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Student Product: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text"> Graphic organizer notes </li>
        <li class="text"> Illustrated broadside </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text"><strong> Closure: </strong></p>
      <p class="text"> Have students list ways they might express their opinions today that didn&rsquo;t exist in the 1870s. Possible answers include bumper stickers, blogs, group emails, television or radio ads, etc. </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Assessment: </strong></p>
      <p class="text"> Remind students that in the 1870s, killing of the Great Plains buffalo was a hotly debated issue. Ask students to identify issues dealing with animals that are controversial today. Possible answers include protection of all endangered animal species, using animals for laboratory testing, raising animals only for their fur, animal attacks on humans (e.g., pit bulls) and animal attacks on livestock (e.g., wolves, coyotes), etc.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Extensions: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text"> Have students share their broadsides in class and post them in the classroom or hallway. </li>
      </ul>
     <ul>
        <li class="text"> Have students view and discuss the actual text of the 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty. <br>
