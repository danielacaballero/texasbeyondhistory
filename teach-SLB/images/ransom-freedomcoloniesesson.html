       <p><strong>Directions for the teacher</strong>: 
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
         <p>
		 Step 1: Display TBH exhibit, &quot;Life After Slavery: An African American-Owned
Farmstead In Central Texas 1871–1905&quot; <a href="www.texasbeyondhistory.net/ransom/index" target="_blank">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/ransom/index.html</a>. 
Discuss content in the Historical Context section of the website, explaining that at
the close of the Civil War in 1865, there were an estimated 250,000 freed slaves in
Texas, most facing an unsure future. What would be the role of the newly freed exslave
population of Texas? Would former masters allow African Americans to live
side by side with them in society?
While many ex-slaves stayed as paid workers or sharecroppers on the farms
where they had served in bondage, nearly a quarter of Texas freedmen found
ways to legally acquire land of their own. Between 1870 and 1890, several
hundred freedmen’s settlements, or Freedom Colonies were founded as African American families joined together in communities to plant roots. Land ownership
gave ex-slaves the ability to support themselves and be independent, while
Freedom Colonies provided a support community with shared social traditions.
</p>
         <p>Step 2: Explain that to learn where Freedom Colonies were in Texas, students will
locate them on a map of Texas counties and create a map key to explain which
counties contained the greatest number of Freedom Colonies. Have students
choose a partner to work with.</p>
 <p>Step 3: Distribute the List of Texas Counties Containing Freedom Colonies and
the Texas Counties Map (one per two students). Display the Freedom Colonies in
Texas Map Directions and go over it with students.
Leave the map directions displayed during the lesson. Have students choose 5.
</p>
 <p>Step 4: Ask for a volunteer to share a completed map with the class and display
the map. Ask the class the following questions:</p>
<ul><li>In what part of Texas did most Freedom Colonies exist? (answer - eastern
half of the state)</li>
<li>Using their knowledge of Texas history and geography, why would the
eastern half of the state be more likely to contain Freedom Colonies?
(answer - that is where slaves had worked on farms and plantations)</li></ul>
<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
 <p>Step 1: Point out that yesterday students learned what and where Texas Freedom
Colonies were. Explain that today students will work in cooperative groups to learn
more about why freed African Americans might have wanted to live in Freedom
Colonies.</p>
 <p>Step 2: Display the Antioch School photograph. Explain
that during slavery it was against the law to teach slaves to read. Ask students why
that might have been. Explain that after emancipation, freedmen were allowed to
form their own schools, like this one in Antioch Colony. Ask students why they think all the students and teachers in Antioch School were African American. 
</p>
 <p>Step 3: Point out that while African Americans were no longer enslaved after the
Civil War and many lived in the relative security of Freedom Colonies, they still had
serious problems trying to live peacefully and prosperously in Texas and other
southern states. Put students into groups of 3-4. Assign each group a research
topic from the following list:</p>
<ul><li>Black Codes: 1866 - 1965</li>
<li>Freedmen’s Bureau: 1865-1872</li>
<li> Ku Klux Klan: 1865-present</li>
<li>13th Amendment: 1865</li>
<li>14th Amendment: 1868</li>
<li> 15th Amendment: 1870</li>
<li>Jim Crow: 1876-1965</li></ul>
<p>Step 4: Distribute Freedom Colonies and Beyond - Life After Slavery Research
Notes, one copy per group. Teacher displays a blank copy of Research Notes and fills it in, using Freedom Colonies as the topic and
using Freedom Colonies and Beyond - Life After Slavery Research Notes -
Teacher Copy as a guide. Explain that each topic’s five research questions (who?
what? where? how?) must be answered by each group. Groups begin researching
their topics, using their computers and the Internet to gather information and filling
in their Research Notes.</p>
<p>Step 5: When research notes are complete, display Positive-Negative Chart. Explain that in the process of integrating African Americans into white society after the Civil War, both positive and negative factors
came into play. Call on a representative from each group to read aloud the
research notes from their topic. Then ask whether that topic should be included as
a positive or negative for Freedom Colony residents. Write the name of each topic
in the appropriate section of the Positive-Negative Chart.</p>
<p>Step 6: When all topics are represented on the Positive-Negative Chart ask
students if they have a better understanding of why African Americans would have
wanted to live in Freedom Colonies.</p>
<p><strong>Extension Activities:</strong></p>
<p>Have students write a one-page essay about a day in the life of someone living in a
Freedom Colony.</p>
<p>Have students view Reconstruction: A Statistical Look At Southern Recovery 1860-
1880 (interactive map) <a href="http://civclients.com/nehint/recon/" target="_blank">http://civclients.com/nehint/recon/</a></p>
<p><strong>Student Products for Assessment</strong>: </p>
<p>Freedom Colonies in Texas Map and
  Research Notes</p>
<p><strong>Modifications</strong>: For students with specific learning needs or IEPs, have step-by-step
instructions for the computer available and allow more time for project
completion, if necessary.</p>
