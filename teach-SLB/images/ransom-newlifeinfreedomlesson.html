<p class="text"> <strong>Lesson Title: </strong><br>
      A New Life in Freedom:
A Late 19th-Century African-American Farmstead
 </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Subjects:</strong> Texas History, English Language Arts, Technology Education </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level: </strong> 4th (can be adapted for grades 5 – 8) </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Rationale:</strong> This lesson contains three mini-lessons that may be used independently or together. In these lessons, students will explore a painting based on an actual farmstead site owned by former slaves, Ransom and Sarah Williams, to learn about African-American family life in 19th-century Texas. They will work in pairs or groups to learn about the various activities and chores shown in the painting, examine the artifacts found by archeologists representing these activities, and compose “snapshots” based on their findings.</p>

       <p><strong>Mini-Lesson  1: </strong>45 minutes<strong></strong><br>
         Students will view the painting  of the Williams&rsquo; homestead showing the property at large and briefly discuss  what they notice immediately about the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The class will divide into pairs to explore the interactive painting and  learn about the various activities illustrated there and complete a chart of the  artifacts that support those activities.&nbsp;  As a class, students will complete a T-chart noting &ldquo;Things that are  like my life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Things that are different from my life.&rdquo; </p>
       <p><strong>Activity:&nbsp; Comparing Life in the late 1800&rsquo;s with Life  Today</strong></p>
       <p>1.) Display the painting of the Williams&rsquo; homestead  so that all students can view it at once.&nbsp;  Ask students to comment about what they see pictured in the scene.&nbsp; Encourage them to restrict their comments to  what they can actually see.</p>
       <p>2.) Explain that Ransom and Sarah Williams were  former slaves who established a farm and raised a family near Austin, Texas.  Nearly 150 years later, archeologists excavated this farmstead site and found a  wide variety of household and work-related artifacts. They used these and other  information to create a picture of what life was like for this particular  African-American family at the end of the 19th century. (See also the TBH  website exhibit.)</p>
       <p>3.) Ask students, &ldquo;What can you tell me about the  people who lived here?&rdquo;&nbsp; As students  offer their comments, ask them to point to something in the picture that  supports their ideas about the inhabitants of this site.&nbsp; </p>
       <p>4.) Students will work individually or in pairs to  complete the artifact chart by clicking on the 9 interactive sections of the  painting, reading the descriptions of the activities pictured there, and viewing  the evidence: the artifacts that support the activities.&nbsp; Students will be responsible for presenting their section to the  class.&nbsp; Students may use the chart to  take additional notes on the presentations for the sections they did not  research themselves.&nbsp; (Save charts for  use in Mini-Lessons 2 and 3.)</p>
       <p>5.) After research is completed, the teacher will  post a large T-chart (chart paper or butcher paper) with the headings &ldquo;Things  that are like my life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Things that are different from my life.&rdquo; &nbsp;Students will use the information from their  research to create a list of specific similarities and differences to add to  the T-chart. &nbsp;&nbsp;Encourage students to  refer to artifacts to support their comments.&nbsp;  (Keep the chart posted for use in Session 3.)<strong></strong></p>
       <p><strong>Closure: </strong>Point out that  archeologists use the artifacts they find to construct an accurate picture of  the way people lived at a particular place in the past.&nbsp; Ask students to give examples from their  research of artifacts found at the Williams&rsquo; site that helped archeologists  understand how the family spent their time. Close the session by asking  students what they would have liked or disliked about living on the Williams&rsquo;  homestead in the late 1800&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Encourage  students to use specific examples from their research to support their  opinions.&nbsp; </p>
       <p><strong>Extension:  &nbsp;</strong>Look at the Osborne site (Mexican-American tenant  farmers on an early 20th century cotton farm) and the Rubin-Hancock  site (freed slaves who became landowners in the last part of the 19th  century) on Texas Beyond History.&nbsp;  Compare the kinds of artifacts found at those two sites with those found  at the Williams&rsquo; site.&nbsp; Make T-chart or  Venn diagram showing the similarities and differences in life at these three  sites.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p><strong>Mini-Lesson  2: </strong>60  minutes&nbsp; (Or two 30 minute sessions)<strong></strong></p>
       <p>In small groups, students will  compose a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; illustrating what is happening in a specific section of  the painting.&nbsp; Each group will present  their &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo;.&nbsp; Students will change  the &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; to &ldquo;motion pictures&rdquo; by arranging lines composed by individual  students into a script.&nbsp; Then they will present  their &ldquo;motion pictures&rdquo; to the class for discussion.</p>
       <p>&ldquo;Snapshots&rdquo; &ndash; A &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; is a  frozen picture formed by a person or several people using their bodies as if  they were statues.&nbsp; (They may also be  called frozen pictures or tableaus.) Planning and performing a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; gives  students an opportunity to explore the activities and emotions of written  material and two-dimensional pictures in a three-dimensional way.&nbsp; In addition, &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; can be &ldquo;brought to  life&rdquo; by adding sound effects, movement and dialogue.</p>
       <p><strong>Activity:&nbsp; Making Life at the Ransom Williams&rsquo; Site Come  Alive</strong></p>
       <p>1.) Display the painting of the Williams&rsquo; homestead  again.&nbsp; Now that students are familiar  with the activities shown in the painting and the artifacts that support those  activities, ask them to describe what they might have seen if they were  visitors to the Williams&rsquo; homestead in the late 1800&rsquo;s.</p>
       <p>2.) Divide the class into four groups.&nbsp; Place the strips of paper with sections of the painting on them upside down on the table or desk. Let each group draw two of the strips  of paper listing the sections of the painting. &nbsp;These will be the parts of the painting that  they will use in creating their snapshots.</p>
       <p>3.) Planning the &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; (10 - 15 minutes)- &nbsp;Each group will design a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; showing  their two activities listed on their strips by posing their bodies in  different ways.&nbsp;For example, the &ldquo;sewing&rdquo;  activity could be portrayed by sitting in a chair, pretending to draw a needle  and thread through imaginary cloth. Every student in  each small group should be posed in a different way, modeling the use of one or  more of the artifacts.&nbsp; (Students may be  showing the same activity at different stages.)&nbsp;  Remind the students to think about how the person might be feeling and  show that with their facial expressions.</p>
  <p>4.)&nbsp; Practicing  the &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; &ndash; When every group is ready, stage a group practice.&nbsp; Assign each group to a specific place around  the room.&nbsp; At the teacher&rsquo;s signal  (&ldquo;Action&rdquo;), every student assumes his/her pose and freezes.&nbsp; After they have held their poses for several seconds,  tell students they may relax their faces, but continue holding their poses and  look at the other students in <u>their</u> group.&nbsp; Call &ldquo;Curtain&rdquo; and allow the groups several  minutes to discuss their &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; and make any changes they want in the  poses.&nbsp; Then stage another quick  practice.</p>
       <p>5.) Presenting the snapshots &ndash; Groups will take  turns presenting their &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;.&nbsp;  (Remind students that if they start feeling uncomfortable, they may  break their pose, relax and them resume the pose.)&nbsp; The other students will observe the &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo;  and discuss what they see.&nbsp; </p>
       <p>6.) Questions to guide the discussion &ndash; What  activities do you see going on in this picture?&nbsp;  What artifacts are being used?&nbsp;  How do the people seem to feel about what they are doing?</p>
       <p>7.) Making the &ldquo;snapshots into &ldquo;motion pictures&rdquo; &nbsp;&ndash; Give each student two strips of blank paper  approximately 3&rdquo; x 12&rdquo; on which to write two lines of dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask students to  think about the person they were portraying in the snapshot.&nbsp; Was the person a boy or a girl?&nbsp; About how old was the person?&nbsp; Was the person one of the Williams&rsquo; family  members or a visiting friend or relative?&nbsp;  What might that person be saying while they are doing the activity shown  in the &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo;?&nbsp; Independently, each  student will write two lines of dialogue, one on each strip of paper, that  his/her person might say in this situation.&nbsp;  (Depending on student experience, the teacher may want to briefly  discuss some of the differences in the way people would have communicated in  the late 1800&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For example, children  would not have called adults by their first names, ordered an adult to do  something or spoken disrespectfully to an adult.&nbsp; Adults would not have hesitated to correct  children even if they were not the child&rsquo;s parent.)</p>
  <p>8.) After students have finished writing their two lines,  they will work together to organize all the group members&rsquo; lines into a brief  script.&nbsp; Use masking tape to connect the  strips of paper and post the script where all of the group members can see it. &nbsp;Allow students 10 &ndash; 15 minutes for students to  organize their script and rehearse their parts together.&nbsp; Students should add motion appropriate to the  scene and may also add sound effects.</p>
       <p>9.) Present the &ldquo;motion pictures&rdquo;.&nbsp; Students strike their poses on &ldquo;Action&rdquo;,  begin their dialogue on &ldquo;Sound&rdquo; and end on &ldquo;Curtain.&rdquo;</p>
       <p><strong>Closure: </strong>Point out that  archeologists are not interested in artifacts as individual items as much as  they are interested in using artifacts to create an accurate story about the  lives of people who occupied a specific site.&nbsp;  Close the session by asking students what they would have liked or  disliked about living on the Williams&rsquo; homestead in the late 1800&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Encourage students to use specific examples  from their research and the snapshot to support their opinions.&nbsp; </p>
       <p><strong>Extension:&nbsp; </strong>Share chapters of <em>Sarah, Plain and Tall </em>(turn-of-the-century-family on a Great Plains  farmstead) or <em>The Evolution of Calpurnia  Tate</em> (affluent turn-of-the- century family living in a small town in  central Texas)  to compare the lives of other children living about the same time with the  lives of the Williams children.<br>
         Research children&rsquo;s toys or chores from the late  1800&rsquo;s.<br>
         Listen to music from the period.</p>
       <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
       <p><strong>Mini-Lesson  3: </strong>90  minutes&nbsp; (Or two 45 minute sessions)<strong></strong></p>
       <p>Students will listen to a story  based on the Ransom Williams farmstead painting and create&nbsp;illustrated journals   containing four journal entries written as if they were one of the Williams  children living on the homestead in the late 1800&rsquo;s.</p>
       <p><strong>Activity:&nbsp; Growing Up on the Williams&rsquo; Homestead</strong></p>
       <p>1.) Display the picture of the Williams&rsquo;  homestead.&nbsp; Ask students to point out  places in the painting where the artist uses information that archeologists had  uncovered at the site to make the picture an accurate &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of life on the  Williams&rsquo; farm. &nbsp;How is the artist&rsquo;s work  similar to the task of the archeologist?&nbsp;  How is it different?&nbsp; (Students  should understand that both the artist and the archeologist are working with  the artifacts and features found at the site to construct a fact-based  interpretation of the life of the occupants of a site.&nbsp; The archeologist must stay with  data-supported conclusions and acknowledge areas where there is not enough  information to make valid inferences.&nbsp;  The artist may use imagination to fill in the gaps.)&nbsp; </p>
       <p>2.) Remind students that the archeologist is always  trying to accurately expand the &ldquo;story&rdquo; that can be told about people who lived  at a site.&nbsp; That &ldquo;story&rdquo; is usually told  in a formal report that uses the features and artifacts from a site to draw  conclusions about the everyday activities of the people who lived there.&nbsp; One of the archeologists who worked on the  Ransom Williams&rsquo; site also used his knowledge of the homestead and his  imagination to write a fictional narrative about the Williams&rsquo; family.&nbsp; Read &ldquo;An Evening on the Porch with Ransom  Williams&rdquo; aloud to the students.       </p>
 <p>3.) Students will write four journal entries as if  they were one of the Williams&rsquo; children.&nbsp;  Boys will write as Henry, the 12-year-old with the new harmonica and  girls will write as Mattie, the 10-year-old who is inside the cabin helping her  mother, Sarah, prepare the evening meal.&nbsp;  To plan for their entries, students should make a quick list of  activities they have learned about that the children might have witnessed or  been a participant in, such as farming tasks, chores or recreational  activities. </p>
        <p> *Mini-Lesson can be split into two parts at this point, by allowing students  to write on their journal entries and saving the construction of the illustrated  journals for the second session.</p>
        <p>4.) Making the illustrated  journals </p>
<p> a. Each student will need 1 sheet  of colored construction paper, 2 sheets of white construction paper, glue and  scissors.</p>
        <p> b. Students will fold all of  their sheets of construction paper in half to form the pages of a 6&rdquo; x 9&rdquo;  booklet.</p>
        <p> c. On one half of the colored  sheet, students will use a ruler to draw a rectangle almost as large as the  half sheet.&nbsp; (Leave a &frac34; to 1&rdquo; margin.)</p>
        <p> d. Using scissors, students will  cut out the rectangle, leaving the margins to form a frame.</p>
         <p>e. Use the long-arm stapler to  staple all three sheets of paper together on the center fold.</p>
       <p>  f. Stick the frame (colored  paper) to the first sheet of white paper by putting a thin line of glue around  the back of the frame and pressing it to the white paper. Students should have  three half-size pages of white paper to write on and a white space on the front  cover of their books. </p>
 <p> <strong>Faster  variation</strong> &ndash; Fold  and staple the booklet without cutting a frame from the front cover.&nbsp; Cut white pieces of construction paper (4&rdquo;  x7&rdquo;) for students to use to draw an illustration that can be glued on the front  cover.&nbsp; OR&nbsp; Decorate the front cover with the student&rsquo;s  name and the title &ldquo;Journal&rdquo;</p>
 <p> 5.) After the student&rsquo;s rough drafts have been  edited, students may copy their entries into their books.&nbsp; Entries may include illustrations.&nbsp; Students may date their entries using dates  from the spring and summer of a specific year in the 1880&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The cover may be illustrated with a drawing  of Henry or Mattie or a scene that is included in the journal.&nbsp; <br>
   <strong>Variation</strong> &ndash; Students may write one journal  entry and draw one illustration to add to a larger class journal.</p>
       <p><strong>Closure:&nbsp; </strong>Stage a museum walk.&nbsp;  Students display their journals on their desks and walk around the class  &ldquo;museum&rdquo; reading classmates&rsquo; journals.<br>
         Hold a journal reading and allow each student to  choose their favorite entry to read aloud to the class.</p>
       <p><strong>Extension:</strong><br>
         Explore the Rubin-Hancock site on Texas Beyond  History (www.texasbeyondhistory.net/rubin ) to learn about another African-American family who lived in the Austin area during the  same time period.&nbsp; <br>
         Read aloud <u>Picking Peas for a Penny</u> or <u>Dancing  with the Indians</u> by Angela Shelf Medearis<br>
         Research the types of tools used  in farming in the late 1800&rsquo;s<br>
         Listen to popular music from the  late 1800&rsquo;s</p>
