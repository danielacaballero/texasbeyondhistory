      <p>This motif is composed of a relatively simple, single design element.&nbsp; It consists of a series of narrow, parallel lines incised either in a continuous diagonal band around the upper part of the vessel&rsquo;s exterior, or in a series of distinct diagonal sets separated by undecorated areas, also around the upper part of the vessel&rsquo;s exterior.&nbsp; In the future, with more specimens available for study, it may be possible to separate these two patterns into different motifs.&nbsp; For now, they are simply listed as &ldquo;Marsh Point.&rdquo;&nbsp; Generally, the lines of &ldquo;Marsh Point&rdquo; were more carefully incised than those of the &ldquo;Grassy Point&quot; motif, apparently at a time when the clay had reached a leather-hard state.&nbsp; As with &ldquo;Grassy Point,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Marsh Point&quot; motif begins directly below the lip and extends down the neck of the vessel from that point. </p>
    Unlike &ldquo;Grassy Point,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Marsh Point&quot; motif appears to be less closely tied to motifs in the Galveston Bay area.&nbsp; Although a few similar designs have been illustrated for San Jacinto and Goose Creek Incised, sherds of these types more commonly exhibit vertical, rather than diagonal, incised lines.&nbsp; Diagonal incised lines actually are more common in sherds of Mazique Incised, especially the <em>Manchac</em> variety, from coastal Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi Valley.&nbsp; Interestingly, no examples of &ldquo;Marsh Point&rdquo; are illustrated in any of the previous studies covering the coastal bend area, although it is likely that at least a few specimens occur at scattered sites in the northern part of the region.&nbsp; <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
