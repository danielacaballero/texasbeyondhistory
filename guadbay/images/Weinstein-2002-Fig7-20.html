      <p>The &ldquo;Cox Point&quot; motif is a relatively common design that has been recognized as an element of Rockport ceramics since the 1930s.&nbsp; It consists of a single, horizontal zigzag line that circles the upper part of the vessel&rsquo;s exterior just below the lip.&nbsp; Unlike all other Rockport Incised motifs, the line that forms &ldquo;Cox Point&rdquo; is relatively wide, and falls in the medium category (between 2 and 4 mm).&nbsp; It also is particularly sloppy, and exhibits burred edges formed by incising in a wet paste.&nbsp; These characteristics serve to set the motif off from other horizontal zigzag lines that most likely are elements in more-complicated motifs.&nbsp; All &ldquo;Cox Point&rdquo; examples from Guadalupe Bay are unzoned; however, specimens illustrated by other researchers include zoned examples that may eventually be designated as a separate motif.&nbsp; There were seven rims and one body sherd of &ldquo;Cox Point&rdquo; in the Guadalupe Bay collection.&nbsp; Two of the rims fit together, while three other sherds almost certainly are from the same vessel.&nbsp; Thus, the entire collection most likely represents the remains of only one or two vessels.&nbsp; </p>
    As noted, this motif has been recognized as a Rockport design since the first ceramic studies were attempted, and it has been illustrated on several previous occasions.&nbsp; Only a few sherds exhibiting designs similar to the &ldquo;Cox Point&quot; motif have been reported in the Galveston Bay area, while no counterparts are known from the Louisiana coast or the Lower Mississippi Valley.&nbsp; This suggests that the &ldquo;Cox Point&quot; motif is principally confined to the central Texas coast, and probably is a true Rockport diagnostic.
