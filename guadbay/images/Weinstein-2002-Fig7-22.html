      <p>The general decorative idea of the &ldquo;Keeran Point&quot; motif is similar to that of &ldquo;Cedar Point,&rdquo; with the important exception that &ldquo;Keeran Point&rdquo; exhibits multiple horizontal lines with subsequent over-incising.&nbsp; At Guadalupe Bay, &ldquo;Keeran Point&rdquo; came in three basic patterns:&nbsp; horizontal lines with vertical over-incised lines, horizontal lines with diagonal over-incised lines, and horizontal lines with crosshatched over-incised lines.&nbsp; Eventually, these three patterns may be set up as separate motifs.&nbsp; For now, however, it is the technique of over-incising that allows them to be grouped together as &ldquo;Keeran Point.&rdquo;&nbsp; As with &ldquo;Cedar Point,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Keeran Point&quot; motif occurs in a band around the upper part of the vessel, sometimes with a nondecorated zone between the band and the lip, sometimes with the motif occurring immediately below the lip.&nbsp; Interestingly, one of the specimens from Guadalupe Bay contained red pigment within its incised lines.&nbsp; </p>
    Several examples of the &ldquo;Keeran Point&quot; motif are known from the central Texas coast, having been illustrated in past publications from the region.&nbsp; It also is a fairly common motif along the upper Texas coast where it has been recorded on Goose Creek and San Jacinto Incised sherds.&nbsp; Over-incising is relatively rare farther east along the Louisiana coast, although several examples of Plaquemine Brushed, <em>var. Plaquemine</em> and Coles Creek Incised, <em>var. Hardy</em> are known to exhibit the technique.&nbsp; This may indicate that the geographical &ldquo;heartland&rdquo; of over-incising is in the Galveston Bay area. <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
