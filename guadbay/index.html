      <p align="left">Some 2,500 years ago aboriginal peoples began frequenting a  small bluff overlooking the head of San Antonio  Bay, just below the Guadalupe River  delta. &nbsp;This place was situated in an  estuary environment between the river and the sea, so to speak.&nbsp; Within a few hours walk, wade, or paddle was  the confluence of two rivers, an expanding river delta where the combined rivers  hit the bay and dumped mud and sand, the broad shallow bay itself, and the  sandy barrier known today as Matagorda  Island that protected the bay from the  direct impact of the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; Equally close were fresh and saltwater  marshlands, thickly wooded valleys, oxbow lakes, and flat grassy prairies punctuated by live oak motts.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">Given these choices, the peoples who began to frequent the  spot archeologists know as the Guadalupe   Bay site (41CL2)  harvested a fascinating array of edible resources: shellfish, finned fish,  mammals large and small, reptiles, and birds.&nbsp;  An equally diverse range of plants would have been gathered,  although we have precious little direct evidence of this simply because few  plant remains survive for long along the Texas  coast.</p>
      <p align="left">Over the next two millennia the Guadalupe Bay  site witnessed dynamic changes in the immediate landscape, changes that  impacted the availability of certain food resources, especially shellfish.&nbsp; The changes that most directly affected the  native peoples of the area would have been the seasonal and year-to-year  patterns and episodes wrought by Mother Nature.&nbsp;  </p>
      <p align="left">Today, even though the Guadalupe and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the  San Antonio rivers are dammed and their would-be waters are heavily tapped and  diverted, every few years they still go on rampaging floods that fill the  valleys, wash away anything that can be moved, and dump muddy water and all kinds  of debris into the bays.&nbsp; Several times a  century a major hurricane zeros in on the central Texas coast pushing saltwater up the rivers  and across low-lying terrain, flattening trees and destroying most anything  human-built.&nbsp; Between floods and storms   are irregular stretches of time without water&#8212;multi-month and multi-year  droughts that wither plants, animals, and people alike.</p>
      <p align="left">Such climatic events and cycles would have had much to do  with precisely when the coastal Indians of the region chose to spend time in the immediate area of the site.&nbsp; But most of the patterns visible in the archeological record and across the  landscape  are the accumulated result of longer spans of time that mask  the dynamics of  climate and ecological change.&nbsp; In  this exhibit we do our best to link the human occupation of Guadalupe Bay  site with the development and evolution of the adjacent Guadalupe  River delta and the upper part of San Antonio Bay. </p>
      <p align="left">Long story short: early in its history the site overlooked   the upper San Antonio   Bay and nearby  waters were on the salty side, but through time the river delta advanced  into  the bay through ever-twisting lobes that sometimes channeled freshwater toward the  site.&nbsp; We can detect these shifting  conditions most easily in the prevailing shellfish found in any one  occupation&mdash;oysters like it salty, rangia clams like it much less so.&nbsp; And native peoples did not dine on shellfish  alone. In fact, fish, mammals, and other critters provided the bulk  of the fat, carbohydrates and protein that sustained life.&nbsp; While shellfish weren't the most  important menu items, eating shellfish leaves behind abundant, unmistakable  evidence&mdash;shells upon shells decaying ever so slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp; So much so that the main occupational deposits   are   dense layers of shell  often  characterized as shell middens.</p>
      <p align="left">The first thousand years of the site&rsquo;s human history spans  the tale end of the long Archaic era, back before pottery and  the bow and  arrow were introduced. Radiocarbon dates on deeply  buried shell layers tell us that Late Archaic groups used the site on and off with some  irregularity during the 1200-year span from roughly 500 B.C. to A.D. 700.</p>
      <p align="left">Around A.D. 1300  the site became a cool-season shoreline camp used by the ancestors of the famed Karankawa  Indians  encountered by  European colonists and later American  settlers.&nbsp; Over the next five centuries  the Guadalupe Bay site was heavily used, mainly during  the cooler months of the year from fall through spring.&nbsp; It was a &ldquo;base camp&rdquo; or seasonal village from  which work groups ventured forth, sometimes on dry foot to  hunt deer and bison or to trap and gather many lesser critters, fruits, and  tubers.&nbsp; On  other occasions they  waded or paddled into the delta and bay waters in search of fish, shellfish,  coots and the like.&nbsp; Archeological  evidence in the form of  food remains and  tools made of stone, bone, and  shell show that the diverse food resources were obtained by varied means  including specialized fishing techniques.</p>
      <p align="left">The most distinctive Karankawa signature is written in the myriad fragments of their  earthenware pottery,  a style named for the nearby town of Rockport.&nbsp; The 1992 excavation of the Guadalupe Bay site by  archeologists from Coastal Environment, Inc. (CEI) recovered over 40,000  potsherds,  of one variety or another of Rockport  ware.&nbsp; This is by far the largest pottery  sample from any archeological site along the Texas coast.&nbsp;  Such a large collection required researchers to conduct a detailed  pottery analysis to study   variation on the earthenware  theme.&nbsp; While many sherds bear no  decoration, thousands  do. These show that Rockport pottery was decorated mainly by  incised  or  painted designs executed in jet-black paint made of  molten asphaltum.&nbsp; The twenty-two  decorative &ldquo;motifs&rdquo; defined by the Guadalupe   Bay researchers are  featured in a special gallery highlighting the creativity of Karankawa potters. </p>
      <p align="left">The abundance and variety of the  Guadalupe Bay site's pottery stems from the role this locality played in Karankawa life. It served mainly as a cool-season shoreline camp  occupied from fall to spring. We cannot tell whether it was reused each year&#8212;more likely it was not. But it was a traditional location that generation after generation of Karankawa people returned to when localized conditions proved favorable, situated as it was on the shores of a rich estuary adjacent to the delta and at the head of one of the most productive bay systems on the central Texas coast. </p>
