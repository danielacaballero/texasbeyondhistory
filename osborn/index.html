				  <p class="text">At first sight, the small farm near Bastrop 
                    seemed insignificant. Based on what remained of the dilapidated 
                    structures, they hardly merited a second look. But as the 
                    site was investigated, it became clear that the story of this 
                    seemingly unimportant farm was worth telling. This exhibit 
                    looks at the farm as representative of a critical juncture 
                    in the state's economic history, as it was gradually transformed 
                    from a property worked by African-American slaves to a venture 
                    supported through tenant farming by Mexican-American families.</p>
                  <p class="text">Originally part of a league granted to empresario 
                    Stephen F. Austin, the T. C. Osborn farm lies near the site 
                    of the Old San Antonio Road, pathway of explorers, traders, 
                    and travelers. Texas Lieutenant Governor and U.S. Congressman 
                    George Washington Jones lived there in a stately two-story 
                    frame house from the 1850s to the turn of the century. Bastrop 
                    historians note that the acclaimed orator periodically delivered 
                    speeches from the upper balcony.</p>
                  <p class="text">But this story does not concern the more-celebrated 
                    players in Texas history but instead focuses on a lesser known 
                    segment of the populace&#151;the laborers who worked the cotton 
                    fields and farmed the fertile Colorado River bottomland.</p>
                  <p class="text">Here we look at the farm as it was gradually 
                    transformed from a property worked by African-American slaves 
                    to a venture supported through tenant farming by Mexican-American 
                    families. Specifically, we focus on a small board-and-batten 
                    house that in 1987 sat squarely in the middle of a planned 
                    roadway on the south end of the town of Bastrop. In advance 
                    of the construction, archeologist John Clark of the Texas 
                    Department of Transportation investigated the house site and 
                    gathered information on the farm.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although the house itself was near collapse 
                    and, by most standards, a relatively recent archeological 
                    site, Clark believed it important to recover as much archeological 
                    information as possible. Based on his preliminary research, 
                    he realized that this could be the first study of a Mexican-American 
                    tenant farm. Clark and his team documented the structure and 
                    excavated 32 five-by-five foot units within the yard area. 
                    After the excavations were finished, the remains of the old 
                    farmhouse were torn down and a new road was laid.</p>
                  <p class="text">In most cases, an archeological report is produced 
                    soon after the field investigations are complete. In this 
                    case, because of lack of time and money, the recovered data 
                    was set aside for 13 years. In 2000, TxDOT contracted the 
                    Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at The University 
                    of Texas at San Antonio to close-out the project. Their work 
                    involved revisiting the site, interviewing former residents, 
                    analyzing the artifacts, and interpreting the recovered data, 
                    including that recovered by archeologist and historians from 
                    the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. The TARL team 
                    had previously documented the earliest farm structures. Using 
                    all of these findings, Dr. Mary S. Black developed a five-day 
                    bilingual curriculum, &quot;Living on a Cotton Farm,&quot; 
                    for grade school and middle school students.</p>
                  <p class="text">As researchers learned, the farm's history spanned 
                    more than 100 years and involved six families: Castleman, 
                    Jones, Osborn, Gonz&aacute;lez, Mart&iacute;nez, and Garc&iacute;a. 
                    The early development of the farm was owed in large part to 
                    a number of African-American slaves who worked for Castleman 
                    and Jones. Unfortunately, the names of the slave families 
                    were not recorded in U.S. census records or other available 
                    documents. The third owner, T. C. Osborn, farmed the property 
                    with sharecroppers, including the Gonz&aacute;lez, Mart&iacute;nez, 
                    and Garc&iacute;a families.</p>
                  <p class="text">The farm was established between 1840 and 1855 
                    by Andrew Ewing Castleman, who bought land from the estate 
                    of Stephen F. Austin. A Tennessee native, Castleman operated 
                    the farm with the help of eight slaves who lived in log cabins 
                    behind his expansive two-story house. Between 1855 and 1906, 
                    the next owner, attorney George W. Jones and his family, worked 
                    the property with six slaves. Politics and public life continually 
                    called Jones, however. In addition to serving as Bastrop District 
                    Attorney, Jones unsuccessfully ran for the Texas House of 
                    Representatives and Senate, and served a brief stint as Lieutenant 
                    Governor under James Throckmorton. He was elected to two terms 
                    in the United States Congress in 1878 and 1880. </p>
                  <p class="text">Thomas C. Osborn acquired the Jones farm in 
                    1906 after a career as cowboy and rancher. Inclined toward 
                    business rather than farming, Osborn directed his attention 
                    to the town of Bastrop, where he and his family lived and 
                    where he owned a butcher shop and later a saloon. To run the 
                    farm, he brought in tenant sharecroppers.</p>
                  <p class="text">Over time, the various tenant families lived 
                    in the structures dating to the Castleman/Jones era as well 
                    as in the small board-and-batten house (shown in the top picture) 
                    built by Osborn in the northwest corner of the farm. One of 
                    the first to occupy it was Livorio Gonz&aacute;lez, who with 
                    his wife, Rosario Dominguez Gonz&aacute;lez, and three children, 
                    lived in the small frame house until 1922.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1932, the board-and-batten house was occupied 
                    by David Garc&iacute;a, who left work as a miner in the nearby 
                    town of Phelan to return to his long-held dream of farming. 
                    The family worked at the farm for ten years, raising four 
                    children there. Mrs. Garc&iacute;a's grandfather, Macedonio 
                    R&iacute;os, was also a farmer who played a significant advocacy 
                    role in community affairs. In 1911, R&iacute;os and others, 
                    acting as &quot;trustees of the Mexican community, west of 
                    the Colorado River,&quot; purchased a parcel of land to be 
                    used as a graveyard, church, and school. Garc&iacute;a's oldest 
                    daughter, Emma Garc&iacute;a Rockwell, offered researchers 
                    a poignant recollection of her childhood at the Osborn Farm, 
                    where she and her siblings grew up (see section following).</p>
                  <p class="text">The Pete Mart&iacute;nez family worked for T.C. 
                    Osborn for nearly 40 years, living first in one of the small 
                    log houses formerly occupied by slaves and ultimately in the 
                    two-story G. W. Jones house in the northeast section of the 
                    farm. Interviews with Pete Mart&iacute;nez, Jr., who was born 
                    and raised on the farm, provide a compelling look into the 
                    economics of tenant farming. </p>
                  <p class="text">Between 1906 and 1954, the Osborn tenants annually 
                    cultivated approximately 100 acres of the 327-acre farm in 
                    cotton, using the remainder for grazing and homesteads. During 
                    that time there was no electricity on the farm and no running 
                    water. The land remained in the Osborn family until 1985 when 
                    it was sold to Terry Bray. Prior to removing the remaining 
                    historic structures, which had seriously deteriorated by then, 
                    Bray contracted with TARL to document them and explore their 
                    history.</p>
                  <p class="text">The following section takes a look at the world 
                    of the tenant farmer, as reflected in the small board-and-batten 
                    tenant farmer's house and in the memories of the families 
                    who lived there. </p>
