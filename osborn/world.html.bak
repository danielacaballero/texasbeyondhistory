                  <p class="text">Cotton farming was vital to the industrial development 
                    of Texas, and in Bastrop County it was one of the more lucrative 
                    industries. But before the advent of mechanized harvesting, 
                    it required hard, grinding labor to bring in a cotton crop. 
                    Between 1840 and 1865, the work fell on the available pool 
                    of African-American slaves. But after Emancipation and the 
                    abolishment of slavery in 1865, cotton growers turned to tenant 
                    farming as a means of securing the needed labor. The tenant 
                    system was popular throughout the latter part of the nineteenth 
                    century and into the first-half of the twentieth century. 
                    In many instances, as was the case with T. C. Osborn, the 
                    owner lived in town and allowed the tenant farmers to live 
                    on and work the farm with little or no supervision.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the late-nineteenth century, many of 
                    the tenant farmers were former slaves, but in time many of 
                    these workers left for better jobs in the developing cities. 
                    This migration of farm workers and the growing demands of 
                    the cotton industry caused a labor shortage that had to be 
                    replenished. </p>
                  <p class="text">At the turn-of-the-century, a reserve of low-paid 
                    Mexican labor existed across the border and was an important 
                    factor in the development of large-scale agriculture in south 
                    and central Texas. Mexicans came by the thousands to work 
                    on farms at wages of about $1.00 per day. In most cases, the 
                    economic advantages afforded by employment in the U.S. pulled 
                    Mexicans across the border, just as the violence and economic 
                    disorder caused by the Mexican Revolution pushed them out 
                    of Mexico. </p>
                  <p class="text">Throughout the 1920s and well into the post-World 
                    War II years, this large pool of agricultural workers made 
                    cotton the premiere industry Texas, and the Mexican workers 
                    the laborers of choice. Their labor was critical, because 
                    modernization was slow in coming to the cotton fields. As 
                    noted in 1920 by Fred Roberts, cotton farmer and president 
                    of the South Texas Cotton Growers Association:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><i>Modern machinery&#133;has made it possible 
                      for one man to cultivate a great deal of land, but there 
                      has been no development along the line of picking and chopping 
                      cotton. We pick cotton like we did a hundred years ago and 
                      we chop cotton like we did a hundred years ago, with the 
                      exception that we put it into a sack now where we used to 
                      put it in a basket. </i></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">By 1920, 55% of all Bastrop County farms were 
                    tended by tenant farmers, many of them Mexican Americans, 
                    and the remainder by owner-operators. Within this system, 
                    there were two types of tenant farmers: share tenants and 
                    sharecroppers. The share tenant rented land and a house from 
                    farm owners, and then cultivated with his own seed, equipment, 
                    horses or mules, and made use of his family's labor. In contrast, 
                    sharecroppers were resident laborers who were given a house 
                    by the owner and received monthly cash advances to tide the 
                    family over until the end of the season. Most sharecropper 
                    agreements were for either halves or quarters. In Bastrop 
                    County, most sharecroppers worked for halves. </p>
                  <p class="text">As explained by Pete Mart&iacute;nez, Jr., a 
                    former resident of the T. C. Osborn farm:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><i>The way my daddy did it&#151;all the time

                      landlord provided the land, the seed, and the mules and 
                      plows. He furnished everything. The only thing you furnished 
                      was your work. You and your family got out there and worked 
                      for him.... When you go to harvesting the crop, you pick 
                      a bale of cotton, you put it in the wagon, you bring it 
                      to the gin, they'll gin it for you, they'll tell you how 
                      much it brought you, you take that check to the landlord, 
                      you get half of it.</i></p>
                    <p class="text"><i>See, you have to come up with quite a few 
                      bales before you can get anything out of it, because all 
                      during the year the landlord, he's advancing you money. 
                      They had a deal where, depending on the size of the family, 
                      they'd give you so much per month. And on the first of the 
                      month you'd go up there and get your money.</i></p>
                  
					 </blockquote>
                    
                  <p class="text">Mart&iacute;nez recalled that the amount of 
                    the monthly allowance was about $20. &quot;Of course money 
                    was different then,&quot; he said. &quot;It was hard to get, 
                    but it went a long way.&quot; Today, he continued, it's easy 
                    to get, but it but it doesn't go very far. </p>
                  <p class="text">His father-in-law, Jos&eacute; Barr&oacute;n, 
                    sharecropped land near the Osborn farm. Barr&oacute;n recalled 
                    that his entire family, including his three brothers and three 
                    sisters, pitched in to help on the farm whenever they could. 
                    Their father was the planter, or <i>sembrador</i>, and the 
                    children provided the labor during the harvest&#151;<i>piscaban

                  <p class="text">In most families, children were taught to do 
                    chores and hold small jobs early on out of necessity. Mrs. 
                    Louise Rodr&iacute;guez Garc&iacute;a recalls that she and 
                    her four sisters helped in the fields from the time they were 
                    five years old. She and her husband, David Garc&iacute;a, 
                    and their children lived in the small Osborn tenant house 
                    from about 1932 to 1941. </p>
                  <p class="text">According to her daughter, Emma Garc&iacute;a 
                    Rockwell, few sharecroppers could afford to hire people. Most 
                    had to use the immediate family. People would get paid depending 
                    on the amount, or weight, of the cotton picked. </p>
                  <p class="text">If you had a bountiful crop, you might hire 
                    people then, she said, but she couldn't recall her father 
                    ever having hired outside help. &quot;We, the families, had 
                    to do it in order to keep the money within.&quot; She remembers 
                    going into the fields by the time she was around seven or 
                    eight years old, and she also took small jobs to help the 
                    family make ends meet. </p>

                    <p class="text"><i>I went to school, but then I had to come 
                      and help after school. Mother, like my grandmother, made 
                      the clothes for us. My dresses cost 25 cents&#151;2 &frac12; 
                      yards at 10 cents a yard. But 25 cents were not easily available. 
                      I recall that canned milk was a must for my brother, Homer, 
                      a baby in 1942. So I found a job washing dishes for a lady 
                      who paid me 50 cents a week. I did this work en route to 
                      school. It only involved about 30 minutes. The pay covered 
                      the cost of the milk: 12 cans at 4 cents each.</i></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text"> The family had a milk cow and chickens and 
                    also grew corn to supplement their needs. Mrs. Rockwell continued 
                    helping in the fields for as long as her father had the farm 
                    (ca. 1941). She was the first<i> Latina</i> to attend what 
                    had previously been an all-Anglo high school and, after graduation, 
                    she worked at nearby Camp Swift to earn enough money to attend 
                    Southwest Texas State University. She eventually went into 
                    the U.S. Foreign Service and worked in various embassies in 
                    Europe and Central America.</p>
                  <p class="text">The older generation, however, often found themselves 
                    bound by the system, according to Pete Mart&iacute;nez, Jr.: 
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><i>You see that's all the Mexican people did. 
                      That's all they knew. You just got by. And you bought things&#151;it 
                      was just on a handshake back then. So at the end of the 
                      year you pay the boss man and you pay anybody else you owe.... 
                      And my daddy would say that money left his hands sore. He 
                      said so much money went through his hands, that's all they 
                      have left, sore hands. </i></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">In spite of the hardships and hand-to-mouth 
                    nature of the system, most sharecropper families showed a 
                    strong work ethic, pride, and optimism. Mart&iacute;nez recalled 
                    that his father's uncle, another farmer, was always a happy 
                    man. He would say, 'Well, I don't have anything left, but 
                    I've got my doors open.'&quot;</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p class="text"> <i>See, what he's saying is that he paid 
                      everybody, so he can go back and start charging from them 
                      tomorrow if he wants to, because you see, his name was good. 
                      He made good on that money he owed. See, that was the deal, 
                      when my crop comes in, I will pay you. And they did. </i></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">Mart&iacute;nez's father moved off the Osborn 
                    farm in 1954 after his son went to Korea. His uncles, the 
                    Dom&iacute;nguez brothers, were the last persons in Bastrop 
                    to sharecrop, finally quitting the system in the late-1950s 
                    or early-1960s. </p>
