            <p class="text">In 1962, a handful of metal and pottery artifacts 
              from a Rains County site in East Texas was sent to the University 
              of Texas for evaluation. At the time no one could have anticipated 
              these few objects would be the first faint clues toward the identification 
              of a significant commercial enterprise with international connections, 
              based upon this site in the East Texas woods. Yet that is exactly 
              what subsequent archeological investigations have shown. Some 250 
              years ago, the Gilbert site was the focus of a successful market-oriented 
              endeavor linking East Texas with Europe.</p>
            <p class="text">What was the market-driven and apparently successful 
              product supplied by the people who occupied the Gilbert site? When 
              did this take place, who were they, and how were the answers to 
              these and other such questions sought and derived from the archeological 
              evidence? </p>
            <p class="text">Before attempting to answer these questions, let's 
              take a look at the site. On the surface, the Gilbert site wasn't 
              much to look at. Part of the site was a pasture and part was covered 
              in woods, mainly post oaks and blackjack oaks. In places, one could 
              make out low rises, about 30 feet across, which we euphemistically 
              called &quot;mounds,&quot; although &quot;low heaps&quot; would 
              have been more appropriate. There were 20 of these scattered along 
              the northern end of a sandy ridge overlooking Lake Fork Creek and 
              one of its tributaries. The tallest &quot;mound&quot; towered about 
              18 inches above the surrounding terrain&#151;most were even less 
              conspicuous. We soon learned that these low heaps were actually 
              middens&#151;trash deposits that sometimes had firepits within them 
              and almost always had lots of animal bone, most of it deer. Oddly, 
              a few of the middens were capped with a layer of sterile (artifact-free) 
              red clay&#151;obviously an intentional addition, but for what purpose?</p>
            <div align="center"><a href="images/C17.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/C17-sm.jpg" alt="Profile of Feature 7, showing thick cap of red clay." width="350" height="136" class="thumbimg"></a> 
            </div>
            <div class="caption">Profile of Feature 7, showing thick cap of red 
              clay.</div>
            <p class="text">In the 1960s, it was assumed that each of the middens 
              probably represented the location of a house and that the 20 house-middens 
              represented a village that had been occupied during the mid-eighteenth 
              century. The preponderance of French trade goods mixed with items 
              of native manufacture including stone arrowheads, pottery, and bone 
              tools was similar to that found at several other sites in north 
              Texas including another Rains County locality, the Pearson site. 
              These sites, including Gilbert, were considered part of the Norte&ntilde;o 
              focus, believed to be linked to eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century 
              occupations by Southern Wichita, Caddo peoples who apparently moved 
              south into what is today Texas and Oklahoma from Kansas. Spanish 
              authorities used the collective term Norte&ntilde;os, nations, or 
              peoples of the north, in the eighteenth century. It referred to 
              the Wichita and various other groups known to live within provincial 
              Texas to the north of San Antonio beyond the effective control of 
              the Spanish. The Norte&ntilde;o focus concept is no longer used 
              much today; we have come to recognize that the archeological and 
              ethnohistoric record is much more complex than was envisioned in 
              the early 1960s.</p>
           <h3><a name="trade"></a>Trade Goods and Native Artifacts</h3>
            <p class="text">The Gilbert site has yielded what has proved thus 
              far to be the most remarkably large and varied inventory of &quot;trade&quot; 
              goods documented from an eighteenth-century Native American site 
              in Texas. The extensive list of such European-supplied trade goods 
              identified from the Gilbert site includes firearms, gunflints, lead 
              bullets and shot (in ball form), axes and hatchets. There are also 
              knives, brass kettles, brass and iron projectile points, hawk bells, 
              glass beads, buttons, a finger ring, hoes (notably appearing unused), 
              horse gear, and different sizes of cuprous (containing copper) wire 
              bracelet stock. Many of these things had been discarded in apparently 
              unused or still useable condition. </p>
            <p class="text">One of the major artifact classes at Gilbert was firearms. 
              All were flintlock smoothbores which proved to be of a lighter, 
              hunting-type of gun as compared to the larger and heavier military 
              &quot;muskets&quot; of the era. Detailed comparative study showed 
              a major French influence in the design and decoration of these particular 
              firearms. None were intact and it could be estimated from parts 
              that at least 20 different long guns were discarded and mostly scattered 
              about the site. Since so many gun parts had been cut or broken into 
              pieces, as were other metal artifacts, it seems apparent that the 
              Native Americans here were experimenting with the use of metal for 
              a variety of purposes. The large quantities of diverse metal items 
              appear to have been treated as a novel raw material and used in 
              a variety of ways.</p>
            <p class="text">Despite the obvious presence of firearms in numbers, 
              no clear bullet damage was found on deer skeletal remains. One small 
              triangular flint arrow point of the Fresno type was found in direct 
              association with deer bones. A large number of the same type arrow 
              point was found throughout the site. These, and the native-made 
              gunflints, clearly show that a high level of skillful flintworking 
              was maintained during this period despite the acculturation process 
              indicated by so many European goods. While guns may have been the 
              new weapons of choice, the bow and arrow was still in use.</p>
            <div align="center"><a href="images/Mb2.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/Mb2-sm.jpg" width="350" height="97" alt="French clasp knife blade. Photo by Milton Bell." class="thumbimg"></a> 
            </div>
            <div class="caption">French clasp knife blade. Photo by Milton Bell.</div>
            <p class="text">Remnants of French-type brass kettles showed extensive 
              wear. Some of the discarded kettles had been broken and cut up to 
              create tinkler cones (ornaments attached to clothing). Examples 
              of more than one variety of native-made pottery, including broken 
              and sometimes repaired pieces, also were found. The presence of 
              metal and ceramic containers again suggests that, during the mid-eighteenth 
              century, the Native Americans at the Gilbert site were adopting 
              foreign materials when convenient and desirable, but still maintaining 
              traditional crafts.</p>
            <p class="text">Native pottery was extremely common at the site. Over 
              2000 pottery sherds representing at least 47 individual vessels 
              were recovered from the 1962 work alone. Among the many pottery 
              types present in this collection are shell- and bone-tempered wares 
              characteristic of the eighteenth century and a small number of grog-tempered 
              (grog is ground-up pottery) vessels. The latter is probably Caddo 
              pottery dating to several centuries earlier that represents an earlier 
              use of the area. The grog-tempered sherds were found in only one 
              small area of the site, the shell- and bone-tempered pottery was 
              found in every excavation. In fact, one of the reasons that only 
              a single group is thought to be responsible for the Gilbert site 
              is because of the uniform distribution of ceramics and other types 
              of artifacts across the site.</p>
            <p class="text">Most of the shell- and bone-tempered pottery from 
              Gilbert most closely resembled pottery from several sites along 
              the Red River that were originally attributed to the Norte&ntilde;o 
              focus as well. Several other vessels were recognized as historic 
              Caddo pottery and were assumed to be trade pieces. Since the 1960s, 
              many more late Caddo sites have been studied, and it is now recognized 
              that bone- and shell-tempered pottery is relatively common at historic 
              Caddo sites. In other words, the ceramics do not help pin down the 
              identity of the group that lived at Gilbert. </p>
          <h3><a name="source"></a>What was the source of the European trade 
              goods?</h3>
            <p class="text">The European artifacts at the Gilbert site strongly 
              point to French sources. While some degree of affiliation with French 
              trade activity was expected because of the site's geographical location 
              and anticipated general age, the 1962 excavation turned up evidence 
              for a major commercial connection between the Gilbert site and France. 
              In fact, the initial Gilbert site report published in 1967 was the 
              first detailed archeological documentation of eighteenth-century French 
              trade in the south-central United States. </p>
            <p class="text">The apparent surplus of European goods hints that 
              French traders themselves may have been present at the site, together 
              with their merchandise. Alternatively, the trade goods could have 
              been brought to the site by those transporting the hides to French 
              traders living along the Red River. The hides would have been moved 
              by horseback&#151;horse bridle bits and the bones of at least one 
              horse were found at the site. The use of horses also helps explain 
              how such a quantity of heavy metal items&#151;guns, hatchets, and 
              kettles&#151;arrived at the site. While the details of the trading 
              are not known, it is clear that the deer-hide trade created such 
              a wealth of foreign items that those who occupied the Gilbert site 
              could afford to be wasteful.</p>
            <p class="text">This circumstance bears a striking resemblance to 
              the wealth of French trade goods present at the Trudeau site near 
              the confluence of the Red River and the Mississippi in south-central 
              Louisiana. Trudeau was the principal village of the Tunica between 
              1731-1764 and main source of the so-called &quot;Tunica Treasure,&quot; 
              a vast amount of high quality European trade goods that were surreptitiously 
              removed from Tunica graves. <a href="http://www.crt.state.la.us/crt/ocd/arch/tunica/matun.htm" target="_blank" class="text">The 
              Tunica</a> were middlemen in the French-Indian trade network and 
              were especially prominent because they controlled the trade in horses. 
              It is possible that the Tunica at Trudeau were involved, at least 
              indirectly, in the deer-hide trade that figured so prominently at 
              the Gilbert site. Anyone seriously interested in the topic should 
              read<em> The Tunica Treasure</em>, a marvelous 1979 study by archeologist 
              Jeffery Brain that tells the intriguing story of the Tunica and 
              the treasure. </p>

                    deposits across the site showed that the vast majority were 
                    those of white-tailed deer. Based on the 1962 excavations 
                    alone, the bones of at least 127 deer were present at the 
                    site. Given that only a relatively small portion of the total 
                    site area was excavated, this number represents only a fraction 
                    of the total number of deer that were butchered here. While 
                    we cannot say for certain how many, we guess that the total

			<p class="text">The deer bones represent every part of the skeleton, 
                    indicating the animals were butchered at the site. It is extremely 
                    telling that the least-common bones were antlers and caudal 
                    vertebrae (tail bones). These bones were probably removed 
                    along with the hides. This, together with the finding of an 
                    unusually large number of end scrapers, the particular kind 
                    of stone tool that is most suitable for hide dressing, suggests 
                    that the site served as a major deer-hide production locale. 
                    To give you some idea of the magnitude, there were 418 scrapers 
                    from the 1962 work alone, suggesting that the entire site 
                    must have contained thousands of scrapers. </p>
            <p class="text">Most of the deer bones were those of relatively young 
              adults ranging in age from1.5 to 3.5 years old&#151;the prime age 
              for hides and meat. Among the bones at the site were those of a 
              variety of other species including rabbits, raccoons, squirrels, 
              rodents, fish, turkey, and numerous turtles, especially box turtles. 
              Interestingly, box turtles overwinter in burrows, a fact which suggests 
              that they must have been collected at other times of the year (see 
              discussion below on time of year the camp was occupied). Other animals 
              of note include horse (one individual), puma, bobcat, and dog/coyote. 
              Bones of most species (besides deer) belonged to only a single individual. 
              The two most numerous mammals second to deer were bison (or cow), 
              represented by four individuals, and bear, of which there were at 
              least five individuals. Both bison and bear have large, luxurious 
              hides that also could have been traded.</p>
            <p class="text">Numerous arrow points and gunflints evidence a ready 
              arsenal of hunting weapons. The metal knives found at the site indicate 
              the full range of deer hunting, butchering, and hide-preparation 
              that took place there. While it is assumed that the large quantity 
              of deer meat was also an important by-product, historical records 
              suggest that hides were the major product exported from Texas to 
              European markets during the middle-eighteenth century. The scope 
              of this enterprise is indicated by the incredible number and variety 
              of trade goods found at the Gilbert site, items which are assumed 
              to have been received in payment for the hides.</p>
            <h3><a name="village"></a>Village or Warm-Season Deer Hunting Camp?</h3>
            <p class="text">Several lines of evidence suggest that the Gilbert 
              site does not represent a village occupied year-round. For instance, 
              only a single mano was found and no metates or grinding slabs. Such 
              artifacts are normally common at the villages of peoples who depended 
              on corn as a staple. There was also no clear evidence of substantial 
              houses, although temporary shelters must have been present. Not 
              a single posthole was found despite purposeful searching, including 
              machine scraping and shovel-skimming; such techniques are often 
              used in East Texas to detect houses. Low midden/mounds at other 
              somewhat similar sites in the region have been interpreted as abandoned 
              pithouse depressions that had been subsequently filled with trash. 
              But with one possible and tenuous exception, no subterranean house 
              pits were found at Gilbert. </p>
            <p class="text"> If substantial mud-plastered wattle and daub houses 
              with thatched roofs (known to be characteristic of Caddo and Wichita 
              villages) had been present, it is expected that numerous daub fragments 
              would have been found. While some daub was found, none of it bears 
              the tell-tale impressions of the woven-limb framework (wattle) upon 
              which the mud (daub) was applied, such as that found at other sites 
              in the region. Additional evidence arguing against a winter-season 
              occupation and a village-sized population level is the presence 
              of only a modest number of hearth/fire pits and a single bell-shaped 
              storage pit. Such features are common at village sites. Also absent 
              are human burials, another common occurrence in village sites.</p>
            <p class="text">And what of the peculiar red-clay caps that topped 
              several of the middens? These were clearly intentional and labor-intensive 
              additions that happened after the middens beneath had accumulated. 
              In other words, these were added late in the use of the site. We 
              considered various explanations. While the idea that this cap was 
              added as a floor for a structure was discounted because there were 
              no signs of postholes, it could be that the structures were temporary 
              grass huts that didn't need to be securely anchored. Another idea 
              is that the clay may have been added to seal in the stench of rotting 
              deer remains. This is, perhaps, a stretch considering the amount 
              of effort that must have been involved. Digging through the red 
              clay at the site was hard-enough work, even with a sharp metal shovel 
              and a wheel barrow at hand to move the dirt. And it wouldn't have 
              taken more than a thin layer to seal what lay below. Perhaps you 
              have a better idea?</p>

            <p class="text">The sum of evidence strongly suggests that the Gilbert 
              site resulted from a series of warm-season encampments by a single 
              group of Native Americans for the main purpose of harvesting deer 
              hides for export. Although not a permanent village, the Gilbert 
              site may have been a temporary home for weeks, perhaps even months 
              at a stretch. The quantity and variety of materials, presence of 
              20 substantial middens, and presence of artifacts linked with both 
              male hunters and female hideworkers, strongly suggests that the 
              group was sizeable and included men, women, and their children. 
              It was an eighteenth-century deer hunting camp with a French connection. 
              It is possible, perhaps even likely, that French traders did visit 
              the Gilbert site and maybe even lived there at times as they did 
              at many Caddo villages of the period. </p>
            <h3><a name="who"></a>Who Occupied the Gilbert Site?</h3>
            <p class="text">Certainly one of the most common questions asked of 
              us by the general public is, &quot;What tribe did these people belong 
              to?&quot; This is, of course, particularly to be expected concerning 
              sites of the historic period. At least equally common is our inability 
              to supply a specific and certain answer. The Gilbert site illustrates 
              why answering this question is often so troublesome.</p>
            <p class="text">As explained, the artifact evidence from the initial 
              1962 work was considered typical for a component of the Norte&ntilde;o 
              focus, a focus based upon similarity of the archeological remains 
              from a group of mostly eighteenth-century Native American sites 
              in the Southern Plains. During the eighteenth century, much of north 
              Texas and adjacent areas of Oklahoma to the west of the Caddo area 
              proper were occupied by affiliated southern Wichita groups including 
              the Tawakoni and Yscani. Wichita is one of the four shared tongues 
              of Caddo peoples (the others are Caddo-proper, Pawnee and Arikara). 
              A closely affiliated group were the Kichai who were a somewhat more 
              independent and mobile folk who spoke a minor, separate Caddo tongue. 
              In the 1967 report, Ed Jelks proposed that the tribal identity of 
              the people at this site was probably &quot;Tawakoni, Kichai, or 
              Yscani.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">I continue to believe the Kichai are the most satisfactory 
              candidate for the tribal identity at this site. As described by 
              the ethnologist John Swanton: &quot;The Kichai seem to have been 
              in the habit of attaching themselves now to one tribe and now to 
              another, sometimes with a Caddo group but more often with the Wichita 
              and their confederates.&quot; It is just such a group that we might 
              expect to find serving as middlemen in the hide-gun-horse trade 
              and possessing a mix of artifacts found in both Caddo and Wichita 
              sites. It has been suggested, however, that an as-yet-unidentified 
              Caddo group may have occupied the Gilbert site. During historic 
              times there were 25 different named groups who spoke Caddo. Given 
              the preponderance of Caddo and Caddo-like ceramics at Gilbert and 
              the known presence of French traders at every Caddo village in the 
              eighteenth century, this suggestion cannot be dismissed. </p>
            <p class="text"> The fact is that Caddo- and Wichita-speakers shared 
              many elements of culture beyond language. Most of the distinctive 
              things that set them apart in the eyes of the French and Spanish&#151;language, 
              tattoos, hairstyles, clothing, and customs&#151;are archeologically 
              invisible. Nonetheless, as more eighteenth-century Native American 
              sites and early historic accounts are studied and compared with 
              one another, we may one day be able to offer a more definitive answer.</p>
