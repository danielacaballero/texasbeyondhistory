            <p class="text">By Ed Jelks</p>
            <p class="text">The 1962 dig at the Gilbert site, co-sponsored by 
              the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) and the Dallas Archaeological 
              Society (DAS), planted a seed that grew into the annual TAS field 
              school, a tradition that has continued unbroken from 1962 until 
              the present.</p>
            <p class="text">It all began early in 1962 when Harold Atkins of Sulphur 
              Springs mailed me some artifacts he had found at a site on the upper 
              Sabine to see if I could identify them. They consisted largely of 
              eighteenth-century trade goods, including fittings from typical 
              French trade guns. Lathel (Duffy) Duffield, R. K. (King) Harris, 
              and I had developed a strong interest over the preceding three or 
              four years in the archeology of the southern Wichita groups, the 
              archeological expression of which Duffy and I had defined in 1961 
              as the Norte&ntilde;o Focus. So I became very excited about the 
              prospect that here was another important Norte&ntilde;o site in 
              Texas. I visited the site with King a few days later and was impressed 
              with its potential.</p>
            <p class="text">I was panting and drooling to excavate at Gilbert, 
              but there were no funds available for that purpose. Then an idea 
              struck me: Why not have the TAS sponsor a dig there, with TAS members 
              providing volunteer labor in exchange for gaining hands-on field 
              experience under the direction of professionals? I broached the 
              idea to UT colleagues Mott Davis, Dee Ann Story, and Duffy, and 
              they endorsed it enthusiastically, each agreeing to take a turn 
              at directing the dig.</p>
            <p class="text">So I organized the dig as a TAS project, with the 
              Dallas Archaeological Society a co-sponsor. The plan was to have 
              TAS members provide the labor, and those members who so desired 
              would participate in analyzing the data from the site and in writing 
              a site report.</p>
            <p class="text">It all worked out as planned. More than 70 TAS members 
              turned out to work on the site, many of them also members of the 
              DAS. Twenty-five avocationals and six professionals co-authored 
              the site report, which was published in 1967 as Volume 37 of the 
              <em>Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society</em>.</p>
            <p class="text">The project was highly successful by all accounts, 
              so much so that the TAS sponsored a second dig the following summer 
              at the Late Prehistoric Oblate rockshelter at Canyon Reservoir, 
              where Curtis Tunnell was directing salvage excavations. The momentum 
              was building, and the next summer a third TAS dig, by now being 
              called a field school, was organized and directed by Dee Ann Story 
              at the Vinson site, another Norte&ntilde;o component near Tehuacana. 
              By then the tradition of having an annual TAS field school was firmly 
              established.</p>
            <h3>Field School as Instrument of Social Bonding </h3>
            <p class="text">The long-standing tradition of cordial, mutually respectful 
              cooperation between avocational and professional archeologists in 
              Texas was manifest at Gilbert: in the excavation activities, in 
              the learning experiences, and in the socializing that took place. 
              The group would gather after supper every day for a discussion about 
              the field problems encountered during the day, to draft strategies 
              for the next day's excavation, and, to cap the evening, a singing 
              session to the accompaniment of some amateurish guitar plunking 
              by the likes of Mott Davis and me. I resurrected one of the ballads 
              from my childhood, The Sinking of the Titanic, which became the 
              group's favorite song. The Titanic has continued to be sunk and 
              resunk, I believe, just about every evening at every TAS field school 
              since then, with Mott carrying on at the guitar after I moved away 
              from Texas.</p>
            <p class="text">The tradition of social bonding between individuals 
              that has been a hallmark of the TAS field schools through the years 
              had its beginning at Gilbert. It was there that I met Charlie Bollich, 
              Kathleen Gilmore, Norma Hoffrichter, and Charlie Smith&#151;who 
              became four of my dearest friends&#151;for the first time, and I 
              got better acquainted with others whom I had known more or less 
              casually before: Jay Blaine, Isabelle Lobdell, Roy Padgett, and 
              Dessamae Lorrain, to mention a few.</p>
            <p class="text">Some of the images that remain burned in my memory 
              include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text">Charlie Bollich, exclaiming that he could not survive 
                without several fixes a day, brewing up cajun coffee from the 
                bountiful supply of beans he had brought along.</li>
              <li class="text">Bollich appearing with several nice channel cat 
                that he had caught on set lines.</li>
              <li class="text">Roy Padgett and Izzie Lobdell driving up in an 
                old panel truck that they had fitted out with bunks and other 
                camping conveniences. They bought the truck from a preacher who 
                had used it to save sinners by driving around singing hymns and 
                preaching the gospel through a loudspeaker. The loudspeaker was 
                still on the truck.</li>
              <li class="text">Isabel, ever the efficient organizer, running off 
                a daily report every night on a mimeograph machine she had brought 
                along, to keep everyone up to speed on the progress of the excavations.</li>
              <li class="text">Kathleen Gilmore running up excitedly with an interesting 
                engraved brass artifact that she had found. I told her it was 
                a butt-plate from a French trade gun. She stood silent for a few 
                seconds as the wheels turned in her head. Then, deciding I was 
                pulling her leg, she said: &quot;Like hell it is.&quot; It took 
                some doing to convince her that it really was a butt-plate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">I am sure that those who have attended each and every 
              TAS field school since 1962 also have stored up treasured vignettes 
              of field-school personalities and happenings such as these. The 
              social bonds forged each summer in sweat, dust, and storm are instrumental 
              in making the TAS the successful and cohesive organization it continues 
              to be.</p>
            <p class="text">Today the TAS has some 1500 members, including professional, 
              avocational, and student archeologists, who share a common interest 
              in learning about Texas' past through archeology. To learn more
