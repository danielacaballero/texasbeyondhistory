		  <p class="text">In the Post-Oak Savanna about 50 
            miles east of Dallas is an unusual archeological site, a place that 
            played a little-known part in Texas history. Here, some 250 years 
            ago, a Caddo-connected Native American group established a deer-hunting 
            and hide-processing camp that produced thousands of deer hides for 
            an international market. The hides were destined for Europe to create 
            fine leather clothes for Parisians and other sophisticated folk, few 
            of whom could have imagined the origin of their sleek and soft leather 
            garments. Their tastes in fashion enriched the lives of an as-yet-unidentified 
            group affiliated with the Caddo and Southern Wichita, possibly the 
            little known Kichai. Whoever the Gilbert site occupants were, they 
            possessed a wealth of European trade goods, particularly guns and 
            other metal items, so many in fact that they abandoned perfectly good 
            items including brand-new iron hoes. </p> 
            <p class="text">By the early eighteenth century, French traders operating 
              out of Louisiana had created an extensive network of Native American 
              partners and clients who provided deer and buffalo hides in exchange 
              for guns and other European trade goods. While details of the French 
              fur trade in the Great Lakes region far to the north are well known, 
              the history of the French trade network in Texas and Louisiana is 
              less known. For the Native American groups in Texas, French guns 
              were particularly welcome because the Spanish, who then controlled 
              most of the region (at least on paper), forbade their citizens to 
              trade guns to native peoples. Beyond their value as weapons, guns 
              were also prized because they could be traded readily for horses. 
              In the early eighteenth century, Southern Plains groups such as 
              the Comanche had large herds of horses, but relatively few guns, 
              while the more settled groups in deep East Texas and further east 
              in the Lower Mississippi valley had French guns, but few horses. 
              Based on the archeological evidence at hand, the Gilbert site appears 
              to have played a key role in the hide-gun-horse trade of the mid-eighteenth 
              century, a French connection in the oak and hickory woods of northeast 
              Texas.</p>
            <img src="images/Flintlock-crop.jpg" alt="Image of gun" width="350" height="56">
            <p class="text">The Gilbert site is in northern Rains County near 
              the upper reaches of Lake Fork Reservoir. To the west is the Blackland 
              Prairie where buffalo country began. To the east are the Piney Woods, 
              homeland of the Caddo. Given the extensive evidence of deer harvesting 
              at the Gilbert site, its location in the Post-Oak Savanna was obviously 
              no accident. Deer would have been much more common here in the mixed 
              woods and grassland environment than either to the west, where it 
              was more open, or to the east, with its dense forests. In fact, 
              today the site is still part of a deer-hunting lease.</p>
            <p class="text">The story of the archeological investigations at the 
              Gilbert site is noteworthy in the history of Texas archeology. In 
              1962, volunteer and student archeologists from the <a href="http://txarch.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#800000">Texas 
              Archeological Society</font></a> (TAS) and the Dallas Archeological 
              Society (DAS) came together at the Gilbert site in northern Rains 
              County and carried out landmark excavations under the direction 
              of Dr. Edward Jelks and several other professional archeologists 
              from the University of Texas. Almost 40 years later, the Gilbert 
              site remains the only carefully investigated Indian site in Texas 
              that has produced a large collection of French trade goods. As importantly, 
              the highly successful, cooperative, and educational pairing of professional 
              and volunteer archeologists established a tradition: the TAS Field 
              School, an annual event ever since (see <a href="tas.html" class="text">Birth 
              of the TAS Field School</a>). The partnership continued during the 
              analysis and writing phases and, in 1967, the thirty-seventh volume 
              of the <em>Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society</em> (BTAS) 
              was entirely devoted to the Gilbert site, the combined work of 31 
              contributors. </p>
            <p class="text">Volunteer archeologists continued to conduct research 
              at the site until the early 1980s, often competing with collectors 
              armed with metal detectors. A great deal of what we know about the 
              Gilbert site today comes directly from the volunteer salvage efforts 
              by R. &quot;King&quot; Harris, Inus Marie Harris, Jay Blaine, Jerrylee 
              Blaine and other members of the DAS and TAS. It is because of the 
              persistence and special interests of Jay Blaine, in particular, 
              that much of the fascinating story of the Gilbert site is now known. 
              Blaine says he owes as much to the Gilbert site as we do to him. 
              During the initial 1962 work, Blaine was a newcomer to archeology&#151;a 
              &quot;greenhorn,&quot; as he puts it. But he fell in with a good 
              crowd especially his mentor, the late King Harris of Dallas, a legendary 
              collector turned archeologist. Harris served as co-director of the 
              1962 investigations at the Gilbert site. One of the many things 
              that set Harris apart from other volunteer archeologists is that 
              he developed an extraordinary expertise in historic-era Indian sites 
              and in trade beads in particular. The famous Bead Boards that Harris 
              and wife, Inus Marie, put together contain examples of hundreds 
              of varieties of glass trade beads, identified by country of origin 
              and date. They still remain invaluable reference materials at research 
              laboratories and museums across the country. </p>
            <p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>The Gun Man</h3>
            <p class="text">Like King Harris, <b>Jay Blaine</b> became an expert, 
              in this case about metal artifacts&#151;guns, swords, knives, kettles, 
              hatchets, hoes and all manner of smaller metal things forgotten, 
              especially gun parts. He first became interested in metal artifacts 
              in the late 1940s when, as a college student in California, he was 
              swept up into the state's fascination with the centennial anniversary 
              of the famous '49ers. Blaine began reading historical accounts, 
              including diaries, describing the terrible ordeals that befell the 
              wagon trains that tried to cross the &quot;40-Mile Desert&quot; 
              in western Nevada. This led to a visit to the area during a family 
              vacation. What he found appalled and fascinated him&#151;all sorts 
              of scattered debris from pre-Civil War wagons. These things belonged 
              in museums, he thought, and not knowing what else to do, he collected 
              examples of some of the curious metal artifacts he found. Most he 
              could not immediately identify, and so he began asking questions 
              and reading obscure reference materials. Life intervened, and the 
              Blaines moved to Texas where he became a postal supervisor.</p>
            <p class="text">In 1960, Blaine stumbled across a copy of the BTAS 
              and realized that there were others out there who were fascinated 
              with the early history locked in scattered bits and pieces. So he 
              joined the TAS and the DAS and began attending meetings and volunteering 
              to help on digs. Through Harris he became involved with several 
              historic Indian sites with curious metal artifacts. As part of the 
              Gilbert analysis team, he was &quot;sentenced to firearms&#151;they 
              would hardly let me look at anything else,&quot; he says, only half-joking. 
              What he soon realized was that almost nothing was known then about 
              French trade guns; even most of the reigning experts had a poor 
              grasp of the intricacies involved in distinguishing similar parts 
              made in different factories, different countries, and at different 
              times. &quot;I like to break into a system and see what it is composed 
              of,&quot; Blaine says, and that is what he proceeded to do.</p>
            <p class="text">Today, Blaine is acknowledged as one of the foremost 
              authorities on metal artifacts. He has built a very important comparative 
              collection of documented metal artifacts and, in the process, has 
              become an expert in metal conservation and identification. Although 
              he claims to be retired and &quot;over the hill,&quot; his expertise 
              is in demand. He continues to help archeologists and museums identify 
              and preserve metal artifacts such as the traces of Coronado's 1541 
              expedition that have recently been found in the Texas Panhandle. 
              Since it is largely through Blaine's detective work that much of 
              the Gilbert site story can be told, we will turn to him for more 
              of the tale (see <a href="french.html" class="text">French Connection 
              in East Texas</a>).</p>
