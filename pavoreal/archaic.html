                  <p class="text">The Archaic deposits proved to be shallow&#151;no 
                    more than 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) thick and sometimes 
                    only half that. The shallow Archaic deposits also contained 
                    a mix of artifacts of different ages including dart points 
                    perhaps 2000 years old, others perhaps 9,000 years old, and 
                    many dating to between these extremes. Unfortunately, artifacts 
                    of mixed age were often found together in the same layers. 
                    This is because the Archaic deposits formed atop a stable 
                    surface to which very, very little sediment was added. Radiocarbon 
                    assays from the site and the dart point styles suggest that 
                    <strong>the Archaic deposits formed intermittently over a span 
                    of perhaps 7,000 years</strong>, from sometime in the Early Archaic 
                    (ca. 7,000 B.C to the latter centuries B.C.). </p>
                  <p class="text">This means that, roughly speaking, there was 
                    a maximum 1 centimeter (about 3/8 of an inch) of deposition 
                    for every 100 years of the Archaic occupation span. Of course, 
                    most of the deposition must have occurred in erratic spurts 
                    separated by lengthy periods of stability and intermittent 
                    erosion. Nonetheless, this calculation pretty much sums up 
                    the main problem with the Archaic deposits&#151;too much time 
                    represented by too little deposition. </p>
                  <p class="text">The site's Archaic artifacts are similar to 
                    those found at many other Archaic sites. The table below shows 
                    a breakdown by general category of the Archaic artifacts. 
                    Most are pieces of tool-making debris (debitage) or fragments 
                    of bifaces (two-sided shaped pieces) that were broken during 
                    manufacture before being finished as knives or dart points. 
                    Among the projectile points were only three fragments of arrow 
                    points dating after A.D. 800 and some 184 dart points dating 
                    mainly to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. Because the 
                    Archaic artifacts of differing ages were mixed together, there 
                    wasn't much that could be learned from them that isn't already 
                    known from studies of other sites in the region. Photographs 
                    of a few of the site's more unusual Archaic artifacts can 
                    be seen in this section.</p>

                  <p class="text">More informative than the artifacts were the 
                    site's features&#151;discrete clusters representing mainly 
                    cooking activities. A total of 19 Archaic features was documented 
                    at Pavo Real; three were burned rock middens, 15 were individual 
                    features (hearths and clusters), and one was a burned tree 
                    root. </p>
                  <p class="text">Of the three <strong>burned rock middens</strong>, Feature 
                    4 was the main focus of investigation and was found to be 
                    an annular (ring-shaped) midden that had remnants of two large 
                    hearths (Features 4A and 4B) in its center. Feature 3 was 
                    a sheet midden (single layer of rock) within which no internal 
                    features were recognized. The other midden was only minimally 
                    investigated, so its size and form were not determined. </p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the smaller features (hearths) occurred 
                    around the midden in a small hearth field. Of the 15 individual 
                    hearths and burned rock clusters, three <strong>partially exposed 
                    clusters</strong> cannot be confidently classified as hearths. 
                    Of the 12 remaining individual features, all are regarded 
                    as hearths. Four are <strong>small hearths</strong> less than 1 m in 
                    diameter, 6 are<strong> medium hearths</strong> having a diameter of 
                    1-1.5 m, and two are <strong>large hearths</strong> having a diameter 
                    of at least 2 m. While the size distinctions are somewhat 
                    arbitrary, there do seem to be three distinct size classes 
                    of hearths that may have important functional implications. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the technical report, each of these hearths 
                    is described and considered in detail. Frankly, for most we 
                    have little to go on apart from their size and shape. Organic 
                    materials (like charred plant remains and animal bones) were 
                    preserved very poorly, if at all, at Pavo Real. So basically, 
                    all that is left are the burned rocks. The accompanying photographs 
                    show some of the range of variability. Black thinks that most 
                    of the hearths were once part of earth ovens of various sizes. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Significantly, the larger hearths were found 
                    near the center of the site's largest burned rock midden, 
                    while all those outside the midden were smaller. This pattern 
                    suggests that larger amounts of certain kinds of foods (very 
                    likely bulbs and roots) were baked in a designated cooking 
                    pit around which the midden formed. In contrast, it is obvious 
                    that smaller amounts of food were prepared in the smaller 
                    hearths. Black speculates that a wider range of foods may 
                    have been cooking in the smaller hearths/earth ovens, perhaps 
                    including meat and plant foods requiring relatively short 
                    cooking times. These ideas will have to be evaluated at other 
                    Archaic sites where better preservation conditions prevail 
                    and direct evidence of food can be found.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although charred plant remains were scarce, 
                    a few small samples of charred wood were recovered from the 
                    burned rock midden, its internal features, and two of the 
                    hearths in the surrounding hearth field. Seven radiocarbon 
                    dates were obtained. Of these, six (including all four from 
                    the midden) formed a tight cluster of dates between about 
                    1900-2400 B.C. The seventh date was about 3500 B.C. and came 
                    from one of the hearths. These dates suggest that the main 
                    period of Archaic use (or at least the main time during which 
                    most of the hot rock cooking was done) was during the Middle 
                    Archaic and early part of the Late Archaic.</p>
                  <h3>Anatomy of a Burned Rock Midden </h3>
                  <p class="text">The largest and most complicated feature recorded 
                    at Pavo Real is the burned rock midden (BRM) designated as 
                    Feature 4. It was also the focus of investigation and better 
                    documented than most of the hearths. As the excavations progressed, 
                    it became apparent that the overall form of the midden was 
                    annular or ring-like, with a central area within which were 
                    clusters of large rocks surrounded by a ring made up of densely 
                    packed rocks of uniformly small size. Two adjacent remnants 
                    of large, circular hearths (Features 4A and 4B) were documented 
                    within the central area of Feature 4.</p>
                  <p class="text">The TxDOT archeologists began the investigation 
                    of the midden by exposing much of its surface prior to further 
                    excavation. By doing so, they were able to recognize the existence 
                    of the internal features, Feature 4A and 4B. In 1979 this 
                    was an important discovery because archeologists had not yet 
                    realized that most burned rock middens formed around central 
                    cooking areas. In part this was because most of us didn't 
                    have a very good excavation strategy for investigating middens. 
                    And I (Black) should know. </p>
                  <p class="text">As Pavo Real was being investigated in 1979, 
                    I was in charge of the excavation of the <strong>Panther Springs 
                    Creek site</strong> (41BX228) a few miles to the east. We were 
                    investigating five middens there and, instead of trying to 
                    expose the upper surface of any one of them, we dug through 
                    each of them with small excavation pits and narrow backhoe 
                    trenches. As a result, we just saw thick layers of jumbled 
                    rocks and did not perceive any overall organization to the 
                    middens. I am now confident that each of those middens probably 
                    had central cooking areas similar to the one found at Pavo 
                    Real. </p>
                  <p class="text">One reason I think this is because in 1993 I 
                    also had the opportunity to excavate another burned rock midden 
                    at the <strong>Higgins site</strong> (41BX184) directly across Panther 
                    Springs Creek from the site I just mentioned. At the time, 
                    I still thought that most middens were just unstructured piles 
                    of discarded cooking rocks and that the actual cooking had 
                    taken place in hearth fields around middens, but not in them. 
                    (I knew about the internal features at Pavo Real, but thought 
                    these were the exception to the dominant pattern.) But when 
                    we used a Gradall to expose the top of the Higgins midden, 
                    we found a dark-stained central pit within which was a large 
                    &quot;hearth&quot; quite similar to those found at Pavo Real. 
                    Other archeologists have since found similar patterning at 
                    dozens of other middens in central Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">Back to Pavo Real. The accompanying photographs 
                    show why the technique of exposing the entire surface of a 
                    midden is an effective way to understand its structure. By 
                    laying bare almost the whole accumulation and then selectively 
                    removing the smallest rocks from the central area, the distinctive 
                    patterns of the two internal &quot;hearths&quot; could be 
                    clearly seen. <strong>The midden had an overall circular pattern 
                    near the center of which was an area pitted by several irregular 
                    shallow depressions</strong>. In the pitted central area, as compared 
                    to surrounding mass of rocks (the ring), the soil between 
                    the rocks was darker and there were some very large rocks. 
                    Eventually, two partial rings became apparent and it was realized 
                    that these were remnants of two large internal features side-by-side 
                    within the central area.</p>
                  <p class="text">The lower part of the central area revealed 
                    a more complex situation than was reflected on the midden's 
                    upper surface. Feature 4B proved to be an intact oven bed, 
                    while most of the larger rocks in Feature 4A formed a crescent 
                    shape around a depression that was apparently devoid of larger 
                    rocks. Based on the existing records and on experience with 
                    other middens, I believe that Features 4A and 4B represent 
                    the superimposed, juxtaposed, and mixed remnants of many similarly 
                    constructed cooking features built within the center of the 
                    midden. Each successive cooking event would have impacted 
                    the configuration of the central area, new pits, enlarged 
                    pits, rock robbing and reuse, sediment stripping (for earth 
                    to seal ovens), etc.</p>
                  <p class="text">Feature 4 and its internal features are interpreted 
                    as <strong>the remains of an earth oven facility that was reused 
                    dozens of times (but not hundreds) over a period of at least 
                    300-400 years </strong>during the Middle Archaic and early Late 
                    Archaic. It is a good example of a &quot;classic&quot; central 
                    Texas BRM as defined by my colleagues and I in a 1997 study. 
                    The two central features suggest that the midden accumulated 
                    as the result of the repeated construction of large ovens 
                    about 2 meters (6 feet) in diameter with substantial heating 
                    elements (beds). No plant or animal remains were recovered 
                    apart from a small amount of charcoal from the fuel wood. 
                    Nevertheless, based on what has been learned in the last decade 
                    from other BRMs in the region, it seems likely that Feature 
                    4 was used to process bulk quantities of some sort of roots 
                    or geophytes such as lily family bulbs, sotol, or possibly 
                    yucca.</p>
                  <p class="text">I calculate that <strong>Feature 4 could represent 
                    about 40 earth oven events</strong>. If we assume that the cooking 
                    episodes took place over a 300-year span (as suggested by 
                    the radiocarbon dates), the midden could have formed as the 
                    result of one site visit and earth oven use every 7.5 years. 
                    This calculation is mentioned only to make the point that 
                    Pavo Real was just one of many convenient stopping places 
                    along Leon Creek and so many other stream valleys located 
                    a short distance from the places where root foods grew (some 
                    grow in stream valleys, others on rocky slopes; both are near 
                    Pavo Real). Every so often when plant densities and/or human 
                    needs drew people to this spot, another oven or two was built 
                    and fired. In other words, small burned rock middens do not 
                    imply intensive occupation, nor do they necessarily imply 
                    intensive use of a particular resource. They imply a strategy 
                    of gathering and baking relatively large batches of food resources 
                    (roots and bulbs) that took a lot of time and effort relative 
                    to the amount of caloric energy represented by the food. </p>
                  <p class="text">Why would anyone have gone to such trouble? 
                    I suspect the answer is fairly simple: they didn't have much 
                    choice. <strong>Faced with starvation during the winter and early 
                    spring when virtually no other plant foods are available, 
                    when hunting was unsuccessful and stored foods were exhausted, 
                    Archaic peoples had no recourse but to eat roots.</strong> Why, 
                    you might ask, didn't they just pick up and move where food 
                    was more plentiful? No doubt they did whenever they could, 
                    but by Middle Archaic times (about 5,000 years ago) there 
                    were lots of hunting and gathering people throughout the region 
                    and there was no place left to move to that wasn't already 
                    occupied. This simplified explanation is speculative, but 
                    it seems to fit the growing body of evidence from Pavo Real 
                    and many other sites on and near the Edwards Plateau.</p>
