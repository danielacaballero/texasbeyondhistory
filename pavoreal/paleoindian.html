                  <p> <span class="text">In early Paleoindian times (about 12,000-13,600 
                    years ago) small groups of <strong>Clovis</strong> and <strong>Folsom</strong> 
                    people camped at Pavo Real for short stays during which they 
                    refurbished some of their tools and weapons from the abundant 
                    supply of chert they found at the site. Clovis and Folsom 
                    are the names of archeological cultures or cultural traditions 
                    named by archeologists for their distinctive lanceolate spear 
                    and dart tips (projectile points). The finding of a few artifacts 
                    below the main Paleoindian layer at Pavo Real suggests that 
                    the locality was visited by people at an even earlier time. 
                    These may have been early Clovis people, although we are not 
                    sure. </span></p>
                  <p class="text">Although archeologists think that Folsom culture 
                    succeeded Clovis culture, artifacts from the two cultures 
                    were found in the same layer at Pavo Real and could not be 
                    &quot;stratigraphically separated.&quot; In other words, the 
                    Folsom materials did not occur in a separate layer overlying 
                    that containing the Clovis materials. Perhaps the Clovis and 
                    Folsom occupations of the site (and these may well represent 
                    more than two visits to the site) were not separated by very 
                    much time. Alternatively, sediment accumulation may have been 
                    so slow that Folsom peoples camped on the same surface as 
                    had Clovis peoples in earlier times, such that the artifacts 
                    from both were intermingled. </p>
                  <p class="text">Throughout the Paleoindian occupations, knappers 
                    made use of chert obtained at or very close to the site. Lithic 
                    (stone) artifacts are essentially the only preserved cultural 
                    evidence upon which we can base our interpretations of the 
                    lives and activities of those who camped at Pavo Real. Techniques 
                    of stone tool manufacture and aspects of stone tool use can 
                    be inferred in some detail; from these inferences, the setting 
                    of the site, and comparative data from other early Paleoindian 
                    sites, limited interpretations can be made regarding broader 
                    aspects of the prehistoric lifeways represented at this site.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Pavo Real was subject to repeated flooding 
                    during the era in which the Paleoindian occupations occurred.</strong> 
                    It is situated on the inside of a bend in Leon Creek on a 
                    point bar in a region known for flash flooding. What is preserved 
                    of the site is a flat terrace surface bounded on its east 
                    by a low bedrock bench and on its west by a steep bank dropping 
                    off toward the creek. At the time of the Clovis and Folsom 
                    occupations, the site area was minimally 50 meters long and 
                    40 meters wide (about 160 by 130 feet). Materials left by 
                    these early occupants were buried by overbank flood deposits 
                    across the flat terrace. It is likely that some evidence of 
                    the early Paleoindian occupations was washed away at times 
                    when high-energy floods eroded the creek bank.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1979-1980 when Pavo Real was dug, there was 
                    little challenge to the <strong>Clovis First</strong> theory that Clovis 
                    was the first North American culture or to the widely held 
                    ideas that Clovis was succeeded over much of its range by 
                    Folsom, and that the archeological remains left by both of 
                    these were characteristic of nomadic big-game hunters. Clovis 
                    hunters were thought to have preyed on mammoths and Folsom 
                    hunters on now-extinct species of bison. It was often hypothesized 
                    that early Paleoindian hunters may have been responsible for 
                    the extinction of these members of the terminal Pleistocene 
                    <strong>megafauna</strong> (large Ice-Age animals).</p>
                  <p class="text">Excavations at Pavo Real began in the belief 
                    that only Archaic archeological deposits were present, a view 
                    that was reinforced when a seemingly artifact-free gravel 
                    layer was encountered in test units below artifacts and features 
                    of early Archaic age. Such gravels were (erroneously) considered 
                    by the site's investigators to be the<strong> geologic marker of 
                    the glacial maximum</strong> (peak of last Ice Age) at 17,000 or 
                    18,000 years ago. Near the close of scheduled excavations, 
                    a Clovis point was found at the base of the Archaic deposits. 
                    A hurried testing ensued in search of additional Paleoindian 
                    artifacts and these were, in fact, found. Most of these were 
                    found within a flood deposit that was below the gravel then 
                    thought to represent the glacial maximum.</p>
                  <p class="text">The dig was extended, excavation strategy was 
                    modified, and several experienced archeologists were added 
                    to the field crew, but no specific research goals were identified 
                    and pursued. Machines were used to remove the remaining Archaic 
                    deposits above the layer (called the <strong>Folsom zone or Zone 
                    5</strong>) bearing the Paleoindian artifacts. Zone 5 was excavated 
                    by hand, and a high proportion of the exposed artifacts was 
                    mapped in place. A number of these artifacts included <strong>diagnostics</strong> 
                    (distinctive artifact types) matching Clovis and Folsom assemblages 
                    at other, sealed sites.</p>
                  <p class="text">In much the same way that Clovis and Folsom 
                    Paleoindian artifacts were accidentally discovered beneath 
                    the Archaic deposits, another component of unknown affiliation 
                    was found by chance in deposits underlying the unit containing 
                    Clovis and Folsom materials. This <strong>lowest cultural component</strong> 
                    was barely investigated and too little was recovered to suggest 
                    what affinities it might have to other early assemblages. 
                    For the most part, it seems to date from early Clovis times. 
                    (A single, apparently man-made flake was recovered from a 
                    still deeper deposit that clearly predates Clovis, but it 
                    is hard to say much about a single flake.)</p>
                  <h3>Analysis Results </h3>
                  <p class="text">Two of the preliminary questions addressed by 
                    Michael Collins and his research team at the Texas Archeological 
                    Research Laboratory were: (1) Were the Clovis and Folsom materials 
                    in <strong>primary context</strong> (where they were originally dropped) 
                    or <strong>secondary context</strong> (moved and redeposited during 
                    floods)? and (2) Was there evidence of any stratigraphic separation 
                    between the Clovis and Folsom components?</p>
                  <p class="text">There is no geologic evidence that the cultural 
                    materials were transported from elsewhere and deposited together 
                    (such as by stream or flood action), nor was there any indication 
                    of a stratigraphic break or separation between Clovis and 
                    Folsom materials. These geological inferences are entirely 
                    consistent with the archeological evidence. The physical condition 
                    of the artifacts do not indicate that they were transported 
                    nor is there horizontal size-sorting suggestive of stream 
                    transport; further, the Clovis and the Folsom artifacts exhibit 
                    the same degree of patination (weathering) and surface damage. 
                    The most compelling evidence for primary context is the large 
                    number of <strong>refits</strong>, that is, artifact fragments that 
                    fit together (<strong>conjoin</strong>), showing they were once part 
                    of the same tool or were made from the same piece of chert. 
                    The presence of pieces of large and small knapping debris 
                    that conjoin one another and were found close together in 
                    Zone 5 is a clear signature of artifacts in primary context.</p>
                  <p class="text">Within Zone 5 there is no evidence of the vertical 
                    separation of Clovis and Folsom artifacts. Geologically, Zone 
                    5 accumulated intermittently over an unknown interval of time 
                    beginning before and continuing after the majority of the 
                    Clovis and Folsom artifacts were dropped. Probably the best 
                    explanation for the component mixing at Pavo Real is that 
                    natural deposition was slow enough for all of these cultural 
                    materials to accumulate in a very few centimeters of sediment 
                    but rapid enough that no stable surface formed. </p>
                  <p class="text">Various techniques were used to date the Paleoindian 
                    deposits and related geological layers at Pavo Real. Tiny 
                    fragments of charcoal were found in the site's deeper and 
                    earlier deposits, giving the original investigators hope that 
                    these could be used to obtain radiocarbon age estimates of 
                    the Paleoindian occupations. Unfortunately, the resulting 
                    dates fell with early Archaic times, suggesting that the charcoal 
                    was introduced into the lower deposits by pit-digging or other 
                    disturbances. Years later, attempts to date snail shells (one 
                    of the few organic materials that did survive) also were not 
                    satisfactory for complicated reasons we won't go into. Finally, 
                    a technique called <a href="images/osl.html" target="_blank" class="text">OSL 
                    (optically stimulated luminescence) dating</a> was attempted. 
                    OSL dating was more successful in that estimates for the absolute 
                    ages of Zones 5, 7, and 9 were obtained. Unfortunately, this 
                    dating technique does not yield precise age estimates and 
                    results n rather wide ranges of possible ages. </p>
                  <p class="text">It appears likely that the Paleoindian component 
                    at Pavo Real was nearly totally excavated. Artifact counts 
                    dropped off abruptly along the west, south, and east margins 
                    of the excavated area. On the north, chert counts were still 
                    high, but the proportion of these that were cultural in origin 
                    was dropping off and the percentage of natural or stream-rolled 
                    chert fragments was increasing. The exposed area of occupation 
                    was roughly 50 m by 12 m. A majority of the artifacts were 
                    found in a layer that was no thicker than 20 centimeters (8 
                    inches). </p>
                  <p class="text">To sum up the key findings regarding the Paleoindian 
                    component at Pavo Real: (1) Clovis and Folsom artifacts were 
                    found together in a loamy fluvial (water-laid) deposit with 
                    no evidence for post-depositional (later) mixing or that they 
                    accumulated on a stable land surface; (2) the Clovis and Folsom 
                    artifacts were dispersed over an elongate area covering about 
                    550 square meters (almost 6,000 square feet); (3) very little 
                    of the Paleoindian component went unexcavated; (4) the Paleoindian 
                    artifacts were buried by repeated overbank flooding of relatively 
                    low energy; and (5) there is no indication that the stream 
                    moved these artifacts prior to their burial. </p>
                  <p class="text">Because of these factors, the Paleoindian artifacts 
                    and two cultural features (both clusters of artifacts) can 
                    only be attributed to the Clovis or to the Folsom component 
                    on the basis of diagnostic features&#151;lacking these, no 
                    specific cultural assignment is possible. Collins made the 
                    following assignments: there is 1 Clovis feature, 1 unassigned 
                    feature, 145 Clovis artifacts, 57 Folsom artifacts, 99 unassigned 
                    artifacts, and 22,933 pieces of unassigned debitage (roughly 
                    16,000 debitage pieces are definitely cultural&#151;the others 
                    are probably natural fragments). There are also numerous large 
                    stones scattered throughout the component that are too large 
                    to have been moved by floodwaters without having also moved 
                    lots of artifacts. Therefore, the majority of the large stones 
                    are considered <strong>manuports</strong>, meaning they were carried 
                    there by humans and perhaps used as anvil stones or weights 
                    to hold down the edges of hide coverings.</p>
                  <p class="text">Field investigators believed that the two Paleoindian 
                    cultural features&#151;concentrations of chipped stone&#151;represented 
                    distinct knapping events (occasions when one or more prehistoric 
                    flint-workers sat down at the spot to produce or rework tools). 
                    The first, Feature P3, consists of small, non-diagnostic flakes 
                    from more than one piece of raw material. In the absence of 
                    refits, there is no basis for attributing this cluster of 
                    flakes to a single knapping event. The other, Feature P4, 
                    consists of a core and various debitage pieces shown by refitting 
                    to connect with a Clovis blade core and other debitage found 
                    outside of the feature.</p>
                  <h3>Pavo Real As A Lithic Workshop </h3>
                  <p class="text">Most of the behavioral evidence preserved and 
                    recovered from the early occupational levels at Pavo Real 
                    relates to the knapping of stone. This evidence is dominated 
                    by tool-making debris produced by breaking up pieces of the 
                    local variety of Edwards chert. While it seems likely that 
                    the quality of the local chert was somewhat better (less weathered) 
                    13,000 years ago than it is now, it was still plagued with 
                    many flaws and a variety of textures. Consequences of the 
                    flaws are evident throughout the knapping debris. In the general 
                    region, better grades of Edwards chert were readily available 
                    at the time to the people who camped at Pavo Real. Was Pavo 
                    Real occupied because, or in spite of, the abundant but less-than-ideal 
                    chert cropping out at the site?</p>
                  <p class="text">The bulk of the Paleoindian assemblage from 
                    Pavo Real is made up of non-diagnostic lithic debitage (generic 
                    flakes, chips, and chunks of chert). Much of the evidence 
                    stems from earlier stages of reduction in this material and 
                    attests to similarities in the knapping process before the 
                    distinctive pieces that characterize Folsom or Clovis take 
                    form. There are also numerous simple tools such as unifaces 
                    (shaped on only one face) and some bifaces (shaped on both 
                    faces) that cannot be assigned to either Clovis or Folsom. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">One curious set of Paleoindian artifacts consists 
                    of four miniature lanceolate points that cannot be assigned 
                    to Folsom or Clovis. Similar small-scale projectile points 
                    have been found at other sites in Paleoindian contexts of 
                    Clovis, Folsom, and Hell Gap cultures. The four miniature 
                    pieces in this collection may include points made by knappers 
                    of Clovis or Folsom affiliation, or both.</p>
                  <h3>Clovis Lithic Technology </h3>
                  <p class="text">The majority (72%) of the 202 Paleoindian lithic 
                    artifacts at Pavo Real that can be assigned to Clovis or Folsom 
                    on the basis of morphology (shape) are of Clovis affiliation. 
                    These include fluted projectile points, bifaces, bifacial 
                    debitage, blade cores, blades, tools on blades, and blade 
                    production debitage. The accompanying photographs provide 
                    examples of most of these. The vast majority of the Clovis 
                    artifacts are made on the local material. </p>
                  <p class="text">All of the artifacts inferred to represent Clovis 
                    <strong>biface technology</strong> (as opposed to blade technology) 
                    relate to the production, use, maintenance, and discard of 
                    fluted projectile points. There are two projectile points 
                    that appear to have been discarded at the end of their usefulness. 
                    Such pieces are typically found near sources of raw material 
                    in association with evidence for point manufacture, exactly 
                    the circumstances seen at Pavo Real. </p>
                  <p class="text">Nine fragmentary Clovis bifaces found at Pavo 
                    Real are consistent with the idea that the site was a workshop 
                    where weapons were retipped. These fragments appear to be 
                    Clovis point preforms (unfinished points) and a fragmentary 
                    channel flake (specialized flake that creates the flute). 
                    The bifaces are typical of unsuccessful attempts to produce 
                    Clovis points. </p>
                  <p class="text">There is substantial evidence for <strong>blade production</strong> 
                    at Pavo Real. Both of the blade core forms, conical and wedge-shaped, 
                    previously recognized in Clovis assemblages are present as 
                    well as various kinds of blades, blade fragments, and blade-core 
                    preparation flakes. The Clovis assemblage from Pavo Real also 
                    includes <strong>blade tools</strong> such as end scrapers (blades with 
                    one end that has been shaped into a circular tool edge). Most 
                    of the end scrapers have a single notch on one edge, presumably 
                    to facilitate hafting; they also have evidence of having been 
                    resharpened. </p>
                  <p class="text">Dale Hudler examined each of the blades tools 
                    from Pavo Real under a microscope and found evidence of use 
                    wear (such as edge damage and polish) on many of them. The 
                    wear patterns he observed are considered characteristic of 
                    contact with both plant and animal materials, with the latter 
                    the more common. Such evidence shows that more went on at 
                    the site than just tool making. The Clovis people who camped 
                    here probably hunted nearby, butchered animals, gathered plant 
                    foods, made tools or clothes out of leather and wood, and 
                    so on. </p>
                  <h3>Folsom Lithic Technology </h3>
                  <p class="text">Characteristic Folsom lithic artifacts present 
                    at Pavo Real include fragmentary Folsom points, aborted Folsom 
                    point preforms, channel flakes, thin retouched flakes, ultrathin 
                    biface fragments, spurred end scrapers on flakes, large thin 
                    unifaces, and multiple gravers. It is possible that some of 
                    these could actually be of Clovis origins. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Folsom artifacts at Pavo Real are exclusively, 
                    or very nearly exclusively, made of the local chert. Most 
                    of these pieces indicate that the Folsom knappers had problems 
                    similar to those encountered by Clovis knappers. There are 
                    multiple examples of knapping failures caused by flaws in 
                    the raw material. Evidence for early stages in the Folsom 
                    reduction technology were not identified in this assemblage. 
                    This is almost certainly because they are not distinctive 
                    enough to be recognized as such. </p>
                  <p class="text">Two fragments of Folsom points were presumably 
                    removed from their hafts and discarded at the site. Also present 
                    is evidence of Folsom point manufacture. This is similar to 
                    the Clovis assemblage at the site and is also inferred to 
                    be the result of retooling (removing broken or worn out tools 
                    from the wooden foreshafts of weapons and replacing these 
                    with new ones). <strong>Folsom preforms</strong> exhibit a number of 
                    failures, some resulting from knapping error and some from 
                    insurmountable flaws in the raw material. The <strong>Folsom channel 
                    flakes</strong> recovered from Pavo Real seem to have been successfully 
                    detached, suggesting that completed Folsom points were probably 
                    produced at the site from the local chert.</p>
                  <p class="text">Bifaces other than preforms include two fragmentary 
                    ultrathin bifaces and two thin flakes with bifacial pressure 
                    flaking. <strong>Ultrathin bifaces</strong>, as the name suggests, are 
                    large and extraordinarily thin bifaces thought to be cutting 
                    tools (knives). Use-wear evidence confirming this function 
                    was not found on the Pavo Real tools, perhaps because the 
                    evidence for that use was removed by resharpening.</p>
                  <p class="text">Numerous end scrapers on flakes from Pavo Real 
                    exhibit the classic attributes of Folsom end scrapers. Thin 
                    retouched flakes and flakes with multiple graver tips are 
                    also considered to be of Folsom affiliation. The retouched 
                    flakes may be cutting tools while the items called gravers 
                    are too delicate to be used in the engraving of any durable 
                    material such as wood or bone unless extremely lightweight 
                    incisions were produced.</p>
                  <h3>Pavo Real as a Paleoindian Site </h3>
                  <p class="text">At a general level of comparison, <strong>the Clovis 
                    assemblage compares favorably with Clovis camp sites</strong> (as 
                    opposed to kill sites and other specialized site types). In 
                    Texas, at least five Clovis camp sites are indicated in the 
                    ecotone along the Balcones Escarpment (Gault, Wilson-Leonard, 
                    Vara Daniel, Spring Lake, and Kincaid&#151;see map in &quot;Site 
                    and Its Investigations&quot;). The emerging pattern seems 
                    to be that of generalized hunter gatherers who would find 
                    an ecotonal setting such as Pavo Real ideal for the variety 
                    of resources that could be accessed with relatively little 
                    travel. This idea contradicts the prevailing model of Clovis 
                    peoples as highly mobile big game hunters. </p>
                  <p class="text">Pavo Real is consistent with considerable data 
                    that now exists on Clovis and on Folsom site distributional 
                    patterns. Clovis site distributions and Clovis subsistence 
                    data across North America reflect generalized hunting and 
                    gathering lifeways, not big-game hunting specialization. To 
                    some of us engaged in the search for the origins of human 
                    occupancy of North America, it seems highly improbable that 
                    this pattern represents the adaptation of the founding populations 
                    of the continent (as expected according to the Clovis-First 
                    theory). Clovis culture is simply too well adapted to diverse 
                    resources in too many kinds of environments to be recent arrivals 
                    to those environments. </p>
                  <p class="text">In its consistency with Clovis site distributional 
                    data, <strong>Pavo Real reinforces this emerging pattern</strong>. The 
                    keystone in the interpretive model of rapid Clovis expansion 
                    into an empty continent is that specialized big-game hunting 
                    is transferable to any habitat where big game are present, 
                    but when the evidence is preserved, most Clovis subsistence 
                    is based on small animals and probably also included plants. 
                    Clovis knappers were intimately familiar with tool stone sources 
                    all over the continent, including some that were relatively 
                    obscure. Their familiarity with the resources of the continent 
                    looks more like the end product of many generations of exploration 
                    and learning.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Folsom</strong>, on the other hand, <strong>seems to 
                    be the archeological manifestation of a specialized big-game-hunting 
                    way of life</strong>. This in itself poses a challenge to archeology 
                    since ethnographic analogs are lacking (no comparable human 
                    societies survive). Pavo Real as a Folsom site seems consistent 
                    with the distributional pattern of other Folsom sites and, 
                    in that sense, adds to what is known about Folsom subsistence 
                    strategies. As scholars struggle to better understand a truly 
                    nomadic big-game-hunting adaptation, this distributional pattern 
                    will be pivotal.</p>
                  <p class="text">Were the Clovis and Folsom components better 
                    separated at Pavo Real, undoubtedly more could be said about 
                    the structure of their camps and the nature of the activities 
                    that transpired there. As it is, Pavo Real provides additional 
                    evidence of the regional-scale land-use behaviors of Clovis 
                    and of Folsom peoples. Pavo Real is probably also a strong 
                    indication that Clovis and Folsom folk camped at numerous 
                    localities in the Balcones Escarpment ecotone. Given the long 
                    history and current pace of urban and suburban growth in this 
                    part of Texas, to say nothing of 13,000 years of erosion, 
                    many of these campsites undoubtedly have been lost and such 
                    losses will continue.</p>
                  <p class="text">There are deep alluvial deposits in the valleys 
                    of larger streams where they emerge from the dissected edge 
                    of the Edwards Plateau and change to a lower gradient along 
                    the margin of the Gulf Coastal Plain. These are precisely 
                    the settings where early sites have a better chance of survival 
                    because they are deeply buried. Sites formed in such settings, 
                    where rapid rates of deposition would favor better component 
                    isolation, would also have better conditions for preservation 
                    of such materials as bone.</p>
                  <p class="text">Concerted geoarcheological reconnaissance along 
                    the alluviated valleys of such rivers as the Brazos, Little, 
                    San Gabriel, Colorado, San Marcos, Guadalupe, Medina, Sabinal, 
                    Frio, and Nueces as well as lesser streams along the Balcones 
                    Escarpment ecotone should identify areas where latest Pleistocene 
                    to earliest Holocene age deposits exist. Additional Clovis 
                    and Folsom sites will likely be found well-preserved and stratigraphically 
                    well-isolated in these settings. Such sites have the potential 
                    to expand and refine our understanding of Clovis and Folsom 
                    adaptations as expressed in the Balcones Escarpment ecotone 
                    and glimpsed at Pavo Real.</p><br>
