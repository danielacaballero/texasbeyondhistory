      <h2>FAQ: What is lithic reduction?</h2>   
      <p> Lithic reduction (or just reduction) is the process of taking a relatively 
        large, shapeless piece of chert and reducing it into progressively smaller, 
        purposefully shaped pieces that can be used as tools. The general reduction 
        process is called <strong>flint knapping</strong> or just <strong>knapping</strong> (chert 
        knapping just doesn't sound right), but there are several different reduction 
        techniques involving different kinds of flint- knapping tools (such as 
        hammerstones, antler billets, and antler pressure flakers) and different 
        methods of applying force to remove material from the parent mass (called 
        a <strong>core</strong>). Chert nodules can be reduced into a variety of flakes 
        or <strong>blades</strong> (parallel-sided flakes made by a specialized reduction 
        technique), some of which may be further reduced into tools themselves 
        (these are called <strong>flake tools or blade tools</strong>). Alternatively, the 
        nodule of chert can be reduced (chipped away) until only a single bifacial 
        tool is left (a <strong>core tool</strong>). <br>
