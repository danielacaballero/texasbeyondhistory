      <h2>FAQ: What are assemblages and components? </h2>  
      <p>Assemblages are groups of artifacts made and left behind at one place 
        on the landscape (a site), ideally by a single group of people or by closely 
        related groups. Ideally, archeologists prefer to study assemblages representing 
        only a single culture dating to a short period of time; these are known 
        as<strong> single-component assemblages</strong>. A <strong>site component</strong> is a group 
        of artifacts and cultural features left during one occupational episode 
        or relatively brief period. Often, however, <strong>site assemblages</strong> contain 
        a mix of artifacts from different times, making it difficult or impossible 
        to know which artifacts belong to the same occupational episode. In other 
        words, we often can't separate the materials that date to different components. 
        This was the case at Pavo Real. While we were able to do a pretty good 
        job of separating the Archaic and Paleoindian assemblages, we could not 
        separate individual site components except in cases of distinctive artifact 
        types considered <strong>diagnostic</strong> of a particular culture or time period.
