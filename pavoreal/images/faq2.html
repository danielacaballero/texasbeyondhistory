      <h2>FAQ: What is a burned rock midden? </h2>  
      <p>A burned rock midden (BRM) is basically a refuse accumulation of fire-fractured 
        cooking rocks (&quot;burned rocks&quot;) that vary greatly in size and 
        thickness. Some have just a single layer of rocks and are only 4-6 meters 
        in diameter (13-20 feet). Others may be up to six or seven feet thick 
        and can cover several acres. BRMs formed because prehistoric peoples often 
        returned to the same spots on the landscape and built cooking or roasting 
        pits. Within these pits, which were often little more than shallow scooped-out 
        basins, prehistoric cooks used layered arrangements of heated rocks to 
        bake plant foods (mainly), especially bulbs and roots. Plants such as 
        sotol, agave lechuguilla, wild onion, and wild hyacinth have starchy bulbs 
        that are inedible and sometimes poisonous without prolonged baking; cooked 
        right, the complex starches break down into simple sugars that are readily 
        digestible and sweet. The layered arrangements are called <strong>earth ovens</strong> 
        because, when they were in use, they were capped by a thick layer of earth 
        that sealed in steamy heat while the plants cooked for as long as several 
        days. A &quot;well-developed&quot; BRM is simply a substantial accumulation 
        that can vary from 18 inches thick to 4-5-feet thick at some sites. <br>
