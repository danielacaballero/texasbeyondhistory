      <h2>FAQ: What are the Archaic and Paleoindian 
        periods?</h2>
      <p class="text"><strong><font color="#bf5700"></font></strong></p>
      <p class="text">These broad periods were conceived of as &quot;stages&quot; 
        of cultural development thought to be part of a predictable evolutionary 
        progression: Paleoindian--&gt;Archaic--&gt;Formative--&gt;Classic.</p>
      <p class="text"> The <strong>Paleoindian</strong> period or era was thought to begin 
        about 13,500 years ago (11,500 B.C.) with the <strong>Clovis </strong>culture, which 
        was followed by <strong>Folsom</strong> and various other early cultures until about 
        10-11,000 years ago (8,000-9,000 B.C.). Paleoindian cultures are known 
        for their distinctive lanceolate spear or dart points (&quot;Paleo&quot; 
        points) and were characterized by archeologists as <strong>mobile big-game 
        hunters</strong>. Big game hunted by Paleoindian peoples included the mammoth, 
        <em>bison antiquus</em>, and various other now-extinct ice-age mammals. 
        In fact, some have argued that Paleoindians caused the extinction of these 
        animals. This view is contested and humans seem unlikely to be the principal 
        cause of ice-age extinctions (climatic change was much more important).</p>
      <p class="text">Today, there is increasingly good evidence of earlier cultures 
        in North America prior to Clovis and we now know that Paleoindian cultures 
        were more complicated (and interesting) than mere hunters of big game. 
        In fact, Clovis culture is now seen as being broadly based on a variety 
        of game and many plants and not nearly so mobile as earlier archeologists 
        had envisioned. </p>
      <p class="text">Paleoindian cultures were succeeded by Archaic cultures 
        across all of North America between about 10,000-9,000 years ago. The 
        <strong>Archaic</strong> era or period lasted thousands of years during which prehistoric 
        peoples developed highly localized and successful cultures based on a 
        broad range of <strong>hunting and gathering</strong>. Instead of lanceolate projectile 
        points, they made many different styles of barbed and broad-bladed dart 
        points used with the atlatl or spear-thrower. They also used many other 
        kinds of stone, wooden, and bone tools. Instead of being highly mobile, 
        Archaic peoples lived in increasingly smaller territories and learned 
        to exploit all kinds of local resources. In many areas, <strong>plant foods</strong> 
        were particularly important and this ultimately led, in some regions, 
        to the development of agriculture. </p>
      <p class="text">In many regions of North America, especially the Eastern 
        Woodlands and the American Southwest, (not to mention Mesoamerica -- modern 
        Mexico and points south), the Archaic period was succeeded by what was 
        once called the<strong> Formative </strong>era. Formative cultures were characterized 
        by village life, dependence on agriculture, and pottery making. Yet, in 
        some regions, central and south Texas for instance, the Archaic period 
        really never ended until historic times. In the region that includes Pavo 
        Real, the introduction of the bow and arrow around A.D. 600-800 is said 
        to usher in the <strong>Late Prehistoric</strong> period. Yet the basic lifestyle 
        remained Archaic and included many elements that had been part of all 
        cultures dating back to Clovis (if not earlier). It is this realization 
        that led to the rejection of the simplistic notion of <strong>unilineal cultural 
        evolution</strong> and successive stages of cultural development (Paleoindian--&gt;Archaic--&gt;Formative--&gt;Classic). 
        But the terms Paleindian and Archaic are still useful to refer to broad 
        time periods. </p>
