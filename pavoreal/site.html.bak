                   <p class="text">Pavo Real was first recognized and recorded 
                      in 1970 by two high school students, Bill Fawcett and Paul 
                      McGuff, long after the original two-lane highway 1604 had 
                      been built across Leon Creek. They had found the site after 
                      TxDOT cleared a new, much wider right-of-way in anticipation 
                      of expanding the road into an eight-lane thoroughfare. The 
                      two students were searching the area for archeological sites 
                      because they could see that subdivisions, roads, and shopping 
                      centers would soon obliterate most traces of the many prehistoric 
                      campsites present in northern Bexar County. They hoped the 
                      information they recorded would be of use, as indeed would 
                      prove to be the case. (Fawcett and McGuff both went on to 
                      study archeology in college and become professional archeologists.)</p>
                    <p class="text">The original site record was brief and noted 
                      the presence of &quot;fire pits&quot; near the creek that 
                      had created &quot;a rise above the rest of the site.&quot; 
                      On the surface it appeared similar to many other poorly 
                      known sites in the area&#151;just another seemingly unremarkable 
                      place where prehistoric people had left behind evidence 
                      of camping and tool making. A few years later, Dr. Thomas 
                      R. Hester, then professor of anthropology at the new, nearby 
                      campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio, visited 
                      the site and recognized that the site might have deeply 
                      buried deposits dating back to at least the early part of 
                      the Archaic period. Hester alerted TxDOT archeologists to 
                      the site's potential and urged the agency to investigate 
                      the site prior to the construction of the highway.</p>
                    <p class="text">In the late 1970s, federal and state laws 
                      and regulations governing <strong>cultural resources</strong> were 
                      in place, but the field of contract or cultural resource 
                      management (CRM) archeology was still young and the &quot;standard 
                      operating procedures&quot; were not yet standardized. Because 
                      some of the funding for the highway expansion came from 
                      the federal government, the impact of the construction on 
                      potentially important &quot;historic properties&quot; (such 
                      as archeological sites and old buildings) would have to 
                      be considered under the <strong>National Historic Preservation 
                      Act of 1966</strong>. Because site 41BX52 lay unalterably in 
                      the path of the planned highway, TxDOT archeologists began 
                      to evaluate the site's significance by carrying out test 
                      excavations. </p>
                    <p class="text">Before discussing the investigations further, 
                      let's take a look at what archeologists call the &quot;site 
                      setting&quot; of Pavo Real.</p>
                    <h3>Site Setting </h3>
                    <p class="text">The general location of the Pavo Real site 
                      figures prominently in the region's historical landscape 
                      as well in as San Antonio's modern transportation network. 
                      As part of it's unique natural setting, the site was located 
                      on or near important but little known historic and, very 
                      probably, prehistoric trails. The valley of Leon Creek, 
                      which heads (begins) only 22 kilometers upstream from the 
                      site, forms a natural corridor linking the Hill Country 
                      of the southern Edwards Plateau, the Blackland Prairie to 
                      the east and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the south. The site 
                      is located within the Balcones Fault zone just below the 
                      Balcones Escarpment, once known as the margin of Apacher&iacute;a 
                      and Lomer&iacute;a Grande. The edge of the Edwards Plateau 
                      is also known as the Balcones Canyonlands because of the 
                      many deeply entrenched streams and rivers that drain the 
                      plateau.</p>
                    <p class="text">Historically, an old trail ran through the 
                      natural pass formed by the Leon Creek Valley and linked 
                      Bexar (modern San Antonio) and a Spanish Colonial presidio 
                      popularly known as San Sab&aacute; (Presidio San Luis 
                      de las Amarillas) in present-day Menard County. Early 
                      settlers called this pass, la puerta (de las casas) 
                      viejas (roughly translated as, &quot;gateway 
                      to the old houses&quot; or &quot;old pass&quot;). The nearby 
                      pass and the immediate vicinity of the Pavo Real site became 
                      a documented Comanche trail leading northward from the springs 
                      of San Pedro Creek in San Antonio. In the early history 
                      of the settlement, the historical trail also may have been 
                      called the camino de tehuacanas (an apparent reference 
                      to the Tawakonis, a Wichita group commonly associated with 
                      north-central Texas throughout the 18th century). By the 
                      mid-19th century, this ancient trail became a major route 
                      of German immigration from San Antonio into the Hill Country.</p>
                    <p class="text">Today, the vicinity of the Pavo Real site 
                      is the intersection of two major regional thoroughfares. 
                      Interstate Highway 10 passes through the Leon Creek Valley 
                      following the same basic route as the historical trail and 
                      today, a few hundred years east of Pavo Real, carries an 
                      average of about 181,000 vehicles per day. Loop 1604 West 
                      runs along the Balcones Escarpment and today it carries 
                      some 162,000 vehicles daily over Leon Creek and the former 
                      location of the ancient campsite.</p>
                    <p class="text">In addition to Pavo Real's location on a natural 
                      corridor, three other factors help explain why prehistoric 
                      peoples stopped to camp at Pavo Real: water, chert, and 
                      ecotone. Leon Creek itself would have had <strong>water</strong> it 
                      in year-round, even during droughts, at least in its deeper 
                      holes. Until the early 20th century, Leon Springs (10 kilometers 
                      upstream) and three other minor springs flowed freely (since 
                      the early 1900s, groundwater pumping has severely reduced 
                      or halted the flow of all springs in northern Bexar County). 
                      Today very little water flows in Leon Creek except at times 
                      of significant rainfall when it is subject to flash flooding. 
                      The finding of water snails in the site's Paleoindian deposits 
                      hint that there was a permanent pool of water at or near 
                      the site early in its history. The relatively well-watered 
                      valley would have provided habitat for many of the plants 
                      and animals upon which prehistoric peoples depended.</p>
                    <p class="text">The site area also has an abundance of <strong>chert</strong>, 
                      the hard silica-rich rock often called &quot;flint&quot; 
                      that prehistoric peoples used to fashion projectile points 
                      and many tools. Chert seams are visible in the limestone 
                      bluff opposite the site, cobbles and fractured chert pieces 
                      are common in the gravel bed of Leon Creek, and, most importantly, 
                      chert was available on the site along a natural limestone 
                      bench that was exposed in Paleoindian times. The chert present 
                      along the bench ranged from pebbles to small boulders up 
                      to 40 centimeters (about 16 inches) across. As chert goes, 
                      the local material is not of a particularly high quality. 
                      It is highly weathered (turning it white and eventually 
                      soft and chalky), often fractured, and sometimes contains 
                      internal masses of a harder chert that makes flint knapping 
                      difficult. Most of it is white to gray in color. Despite 
                      its uneven quality, the Pavo Real chert was used intensively 
                      by the Paleoindian groups who camped at the site and less 
                      intensively by later Archaic peoples.</p>
                    <p class="text">The third factor is that the site is located 
                      along a broad <strong>ecotone</strong> or zone of mixed plant and 
                      animal communities sharing characteristics of the Edwards 
                      Plateau (Balconian biotic province) to the north, the Blackland 
                      Prairie (Texan biotic province) and the Gulf Coastal Plain 
                      (Tamaulipan biotic province) to the south. North of the 
                      site, the plateau is rocky, hilly, and has mostly thin soils. 
                      The vegetation is drought-resistant oak-juniper savanna 
                      on uplands and slopes with hardwood forests in the better-watered 
                      canyons and valleys. Along perennial streams are found cypress, 
                      pecan, willow, and other trees dependent upon abundant water. 
                      Among the streams and rivers that form the Balcones Canyonlands, 
                      Leon Creek is rather small and intermittent. Not far east 
                      of the site is a narrow band of the Blackland Prairie, which 
                      was originally dominated by tall grasses. South of the site, 
                      is the expansive Gulf Coast Plain, which is covered mainly 
                      in drought-resistant thorny scrub brush and grasses except 
                      along streams. </p>
                    <p class="text">In summary, the Pavo Real site was located 
                      on a natural transportation corridor in a location that 
                      provided prehistoric peoples with convenient access to the 
                      basic necessities of hunting and gathering life: water, 
                      tool-making materials (chert and wood), plants and animals. 
                      But don't get the wrong idea&#151;Pavo Real was not a particularly 
                      idyllic or favorable spot, it was just in a general location 
                      that had lots of things going for it. There are (or were) 
                      dozens of other prehistoric sites located along this stretch 
                      of Leon Creek, some of them were probably more-favored spots, 
                      to judge by the relative quantities and densities of refuse. 
                      Many major prehistoric occupation sites occur along the 
                      Balcones Escarpment, especially at the major springs and 
                      along the larger streams and rivers. At times of drought, 
                      the Balcones Canyonlands may have served as critical resource 
                      areas because of the permanent water and wealth and diversity 
                      of other natural resources. </p>
                    <h3>Investigations </h3>
                    <p class="text">When TxDOT archeologists began to investigate 
                      Pavo Real, they thought it was a typical Archaic campsite, 
                      as it indeed proved to be (in part). Archeologist Jerry 
                      Henderson was placed in charge of the fieldwork assisted 
                      by Glenn T. Goode and several other TxDOT archeologists. 
                      Initial backhoe testing in late May 1979 revealed the presence 
                      of several shallowly buried middens and deeper deposits 
                      suspected to date to the Early Archaic (about 7,000-9,000 
                      years ago). As the TxDOT work progressed, the Archaic deposits 
                      at 41BX52 were found to include at least one well-developed 
                      burned rock midden (Feature 4) as well as several smaller 
                      middens, all located along the terrace edge nearest the 
                      creek. A hearth field of undetermined extent occurred in 
                      the vicinity of the annular (ring-shaped) midden, the only 
                      area of the site where the Archaic deposits were sampled 
                      reasonably well.</p>
                    <p class="text">Following the backhoe trenching in May, 1979, 
                      the TxDOT archeologists began hand excavations at Pavo Real 
                      to examine the middens and dig below them in hopes of finding 
                      an Early Archaic component. [Most burned rock middens date 
                      to the Middle Archaic period (about 5,000-7,000 years ago) 
                      or later. The lifeways of earlier Archaic peoples was very 
                      poorly known in the late 1970s and was the subject of considerable 
                      interest.] For most of the summer of 1979, the archeologists, 
                      aided by local TxDOT workers opened up a series of small 
                      excavation units, mostly 2-x-2 meter squares, in different 
                      parts of the site. They concentrated most of their effort 
                      in and around the site's largest burned rock midden (designated 
                      Feature 4).</p>
                    <p class="text">By mid-August time was running out; fieldwork 
                      was scheduled to be completed before the end of August. 
                      Thus far the site hadn't turned up much that was particularly 
                      interesting or different from previously excavated sites. 
                      <strong>It was a typical burned rock midden site dating mainly 
                      to the Middle and Late Archaic periods with some evidence 
                      of Early Archaic occupation</strong>. But preservation conditions 
                      were poor&#151;almost nothing was found except burned rocks, 
                      dart points and other chipped stone tools, and lots of tool-making 
                      debris. In a few cases some charcoal was found in some of 
                      the hearths that might yield radiocarbon dates.</p>
                    <p class="text">Friday August 17th would be the last day for 
                      the local workers, and the Austin-based archeologists expected 
                      to wrap things up the following week. It was apparent that 
                      many of the excavation units could not be completed within 
                      the remaining time. Then, <strong>unexpectedly, a Clovis point 
                      was found on August 15th</strong> within what had previously 
                      been considered an Early Archaic deposit (only 45 centimeters, 
                      or 18 inches, beneath the surface). This find was potentially 
                      important because Clovis sites were rare&#151;was this an 
                      isolated find?</p>
                    <p class="text">The archeologists were given a several-week 
                      extension to determine whether intact Paleoindian deposits 
                      were present. By late September they had found a Folsom 
                      point and other early artifacts and determined that an isolated 
                      Paleoindian component was present, sandwiched between two 
                      gravel lenses. A Gradall (a large precision-digging machine 
                      often used in highway construction) was then brought in 
                      to remove most of the remaining Archaic deposits north and 
                      east of Feature 4. Despite continued pressure to hurry up 
                      and finish the dig so that highway construction could proceed, 
                      the dig was extended by several months to investigate the 
                      Paleoindian materials.</p>
                    <p class="text">The second half of the dig, from October, 
                      1979, to January, 1980, concentrated exclusively on the 
                      site's Paleoindian component, which rested in a sandy layer 
                      between two gravel lenses. Henderson was still in charge 
                      of the work, but additional experienced professional archeologists 
                      were hired on to help. At the time, the archeologists thought 
                      the early materials dated mainly to the Folsom period and 
                      so they called the sandy layer the <strong>Folsom zone</strong>. To 
                      investigate the zone, they laid out a series of 2-x-2-meter 
                      squares that systematically covered most of the area (in 
                      contrast to the spotty approach taken with the Archaic dig). 
                      Instead of digging using mainly shovels, as was done with 
                      the Archaic dig, they dug mainly with trowels and carefully 
                      plotted the locations of many of the artifacts they found. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">In addition to the archeological dig there 
                      was also geological work done to try and understand how 
                      the Paleoindian component formed. This mainly consisted 
                      of using heavy machines to dig deep, but narrow, trenches 
                      through various parts of the site followed by detailed geological 
                      recording. Unfortunately, the geological work was not coordinated 
                      with the archeological work, resulting in several missed 
                      research opportunities. For example, the deposits identified 
                      geologically as those most likely to show stratigraphic 
                      separation between Clovis and Folsom occupations were not 
                      targeted by the archeological excavations. Another missed 
                      opportunity was the chance to effectively sample a deeply 
                      buried deposit beneath the main Paleoindian deposit. Flint 
                      flakes (tool-making debris) were found in a deep geological 
                      test, but this was not followed up by excavation. These 
                      materials could date to earliest Clovis times or possibly 
                      even earlier.</p>
                    <p class="text">One very far-sighted thing that did come from 
                      the geological work was the taking of four <strong>soil monoliths</strong>. 
                      Archeologist Grant Hall from the Center for Archaeological 
                      Research at nearby UT-San Antonio lent his expertise in 
                      this effort. Soil monoliths are columns of sediment that 
                      were carved out of the walls of some of the trenches, solidified 
                      with a plastic resin, wrapped in burlap, and then encased 
                      in wooden boxes built around the columns. The accompanying 
                      photographs show how this was done. Such samples provide 
                      &quot;witness columns&quot; of intact sediments for future 
                      studies. And, in fact, archeologists and soil scientists 
                      20 years later were able to take samples from the archived 
                      Pavo Real soil monoliths and apply sophisticated new analytical 
                      techniques to study how the site formed and to date the 
                      site's deposits. </p>
                    <p class="text">After the Pavo Real dig ended in early 1980, 
                      the materials were processed in TxDOT's archeological laboratory 
                      and Jerry Henderson began initial analysis. Unfortunately, 
                      other agency priorities intervened, personnel changed, and 
                      the project remained uncompleted for two decades. </p>
                    <p class="text">In 2000, archeologists from the Texas Archeological 
                      Research Laboratory began to analyze the Pavo Real materials 
                      under contract to TxDOT. Noted Paleoindian expert and geoarcheologist 
                      Michael B. Collins directed the studies of the Paleoindian 
                      materials. Pavo Real's Archaic materials were studied by 
                      Steve Black, who had directed the excavation of another 
                      Archaic burned rock midden site in northern Bexar County, 
                      the Panther Springs Creek site, in 1979-1980 while the work 
                      at Pavo Real was underway. Dale Hudler managed the project 
                      and undertook a variety of special studies of projectile 
                      points and other materials. Expert consultants were called 
                      in to do other specialized studies, particularly those of 
                      the soil monoliths. The work was completed in 2003, culminating 
                      in a thorough scientific report and this web exhibit.</p>
