                    Creek on Loop 1604 just west of Interstate 10 in northwest 
                    San Antonio, Texas. As they speed over the creek, few drivers 
                    have any idea that Clovis and Folsom peoples once camped here 
                    some 12,000-13,000 years ago. Of course, long ago ancient 
                    campsites were common along the spring-fed streams that drain 
                    the Edwards Plateau along the Balcones Escarpment and some 
                    are still preserved today, despite the intense urban and suburban 
                    development in this area of Texas. But this particular place, 
                    which is known today as the Pavo Real site, was the subject 
                    of a major archeological excavation in 1979-1980. This is 
                    its story.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the late 1970s the Texas Department of Transportation 
                    (TxDOT, then called the Texas Department of Highways and Public 
                    Transportation) was in the process of expanding a rural two-lane 
                    road, FM 1604, into a divided, multiple-lane suburban highway 
                    (Loop 1604) in northern Bexar County. In the highway's path 
                    lay a known archeological site with the official designation 
                    41BX52<strong> </strong>(being the 52nd site recorded in Bexar County, 
                    Texas). The archeological site was situated on the banks of 
                    Leon Creek on the inside of a bend in the stream. In 1979 
                    the potential significance of the site was brought to the 
                    attention of TxDOT archeologists, who soon began archeological 
                    excavations there in an attempt to mitigate the looming impact 
                    of the highway construction project. </p>
                  <p class="text">The excavations revealed a rather typical Archaic-era 
                    accumulation of burned rocks (spent cooking stones) and tool-making 
                    debris first seen on the surface and found buried within the 
                    shallow soils that had built up along a low stream terrace 
                    that extended for several hundred yards along Leon Creek. 
                    Artifacts and cooking pits (hearths) showed that Archaic hunters 
                    and gatherers had camped briefly at this spot off and on for 
                    at least 7,000 years. Below the Archaic deposits was a series 
                    of stream-laid gravel, sand, and silt layers that accumulated 
                    near the end of the Pleistocene (last Ice Age) about 10,000-11,00 
                    B.C. As the end of the planned dig neared in August, 1979, 
                    the excavators started finding early Paleoindian artifacts 
                    including Folsom and Clovis points in a thin layer sandwiched 
                    between layers of gravel.</p>
                  <p class="text">At the time, few Early Paleoindian sites had 
                    ever been investigated in this area of Texas and the site 
                    on Leon Creek appeared to hold great promise for understanding 
                    lives of the mobile &quot;big game hunters,&quot; as Clovis 
                    and Folsom peoples were thought to represent. So the dig was 
                    extended and allowed to continue even as construction on the 
                    new highway continued apace all around the excavation. Abundant 
                    evidence of stone tool-making activities dating mainly to 
                    the Clovis period (about 13,500 to 12,500 years ago or 10,500-11,500 
                    B.C.) was found. Clovis &quot;knappers&quot; (short for flint-knappers, 
                    the term for those who make tools by chipping or knapping 
                    flint or &quot;chert&quot;) had taken advantage of the abundant 
                    chert that outcrops just across Leon Creek from the campsite. 
                    They had knocked off large, narrow &quot;blades&quot; from 
                    chert nodules and fashioned various kinds of cutting and scraping 
                    tools from them. </p>
                  <p class="text">After several more months of digging, the excavations 
                    were halted and a new bridge was built over Leon Creek, entombing 
                    in concrete what remained of the archeological site, which 
                    had been named Pavo Real (Spanish for peacock). <strong>The archeological 
                    excavations at the Pavo Real site had recovered important 
                    evidence of early Paleoindian lifeways as well as some new 
                    insight into the Archaic period as well.</strong> Unfortunately, 
                    the original excavators were not able to publish a report 
                    on their work. The Pavo Real materials remained unanalyzed 
                    for 20 years. As a result the important discoveries made at 
                    the site lost much of their impact as comparable discoveries 
                    were made elsewhere in Texas and elsewhere in North America. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Two decades later, TxDOT contracted with the 
                    Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of the University 
                    of Texas at Austin to complete the analysis and reporting 
                    of the Pavo Real site. An extensive technical report was prepared 
                    that provides a detailed scientific appraisal of the archeological 
                    site. The web exhibit you are reading is a public education
