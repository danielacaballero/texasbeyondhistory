        <li><strong>Archaic: </strong>&nbsp;period  of time between 10,000 to 1,200 years ago when people began to become less mobile,  as populations increased. Archaic peoples had less territory (area) in which to  look for food because there were more and more people through time. This meant  less and less &quot;open&quot; space. Hemmed in with more mouths to feed,  Archaic peoples learned to use more natural resources, from rats to roots to  bugs. In some areas of North America, this  increased sedentism led to the domestication of plants and the  beginning of agriculture and  settled village life.</li>

        </strong></span></a>&nbsp; groups that support themselves by hunting and fishing and by  gathering wild fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;  Hunters and gatherers are usually nomadic.&nbsp; For most of human history, people hunted animals and gathered plants in the wild, instead of  growing crops or raising animals such as cattle. They did not have grocery  stores for food or hardware stores for tools as we do today. In some countries, people such as some Australian Aborigines  still practice a hunting and  gathering lifestyle.&nbsp;</li>

Generally, younger layers are deposited on top of older  layers. In geology, stratigraphy is the study of layers of rock, including  their geographic extent, age, classification, characteristics and formation. </li>

    <ul>
          <li><strong>Trinomial:&nbsp;</strong>  a designation consisting of  three parts. Archeologists use a trinomial to distinguish sites, such  as 41BX831, the Richard Beene site. </li>
