  <p>This exhibit  was written in 2006 by <strong>Dr. Alston V. Thoms</strong> and TBH editorial assistant  <strong>Jeff Taff</strong>. Portions were adapted from the   final technical report on the Richard Beene investigations by  Thoms   and Rolfe Mandel. <strong>Heather Smith</strong> prepared the exhibit for the  web. TBH editors Susan Dial and Carol Schlenk created the interactive learning module, &quot;Dig through Layers of Time&quot; with web develper Josh Leong. This exhibit was partially underwritten by grants from the <strong>National Endowment for the Humanities</strong> and the <strong>Texas Preservation Trust Fund</strong> (Texas Historical Commission). TBH partner organization the <strong>Southern Texas Archaeological Association</strong> (STAA) also helped sponsor the exhibit and deserves credit because many of its members participated in a STAA field school at the  Beene site in 1994 and participated in other field work at Applewhite Reservoir. </p>
  <p> Thoms is professor of anthropology at <strong>Texas A&amp;M University</strong> and directs  the <strong> Archaeological-Ecological Laboratory</strong>. He directed over a decade of archeological research  at the Beene site, most it of while serving as the director for the <strong>Center for Ecological Archaeology</strong>. His research interests center on the hunter-gatherers of North America and included land-use practices, tool-stone and cook-stone technology, heritage                     resources management, site-formation processes, archaeological                     ecology, and cooperative-research with American Indians and                     other archaeological stakeholders. He has carried out extensive archeological field research for over three decades in Texas, the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and the Southeast. </p>
  <p>Thoms'  fieldwork in Texas spans more than 30 years, during which time he has worked closely with avocational archeologists, Native American groups, Civil War enthusiasts, and local historical  organizations. Thoms is a sixth-generation Texan whose archeological interests date to his grade-school days in the Texas Panhandle  when his father taught him how to find Indian campsites around  playa lakes and along draws. To learn more about his research interests and accomplishments, see <a href="https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/anthropology/profile/alston-thoms/" target="_blank">Thoms' TAMU faculty profile</a>. </p>
  <p>All of the otherwise unattributed photographs were taken by TAMU archeologists, most of them by Thoms.  Most of the graphics are taken from the forthcoming final report. TAMU Curator of Anthropology <strong>Patricia Clabaugh</strong> provided the images and graphics and has been involved with the Applewhite investigations since the early 1990s. She and her staff did all of the curation for the Richard Beene site collections and archives. Retired archeologist and active artist <strong>Dr. Frank A. Weir</strong> painted the "Life at Beene" scene.</p>
