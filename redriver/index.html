				 <h3 align="center">The Red River War of 1874</h3>
                  <p class="text">During the summer of 1874, 
                    the U. S. Army launched a campaign to remove the Comanche, 
                    Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indian tribes from the 
                    Southern Plains and enforce their relocation to reservations 
                    in Indian Territory. The actions of 1874 were unlike any prior 
                    attempts by the Army to pacify this area of the western frontier. 
                    The Red River War led to the end of an entire way of life 
                    for the Southern Plains tribes and brought about a new chapter 
                    in Texas history.</p>
                  <p class="text">A number of factors led to the military's campaign 
                    against the Indians. Westward-bound settlers came into conflict 
                    with the nomadic tribes that claimed the buffalo plains as 
                    their homeland during the nineteenth century. To provide a 
                    measure of protection for these settlers, the Army established 
                    a series of frontier forts. The outbreak of the Civil War 
                    resulted in a withdrawal of the military from the western 
                    frontier. The Indians took advantage of the situation and 
                    aggressively exerted control over the Southern Plains. There 
                    was an outcry for the government to take action.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 called for 
                    two reservations to be set aside in Indian Territory&#151;one 
                    for the Comanche and Kiowa and another for the Southern Cheyenne 
                    and Arapaho. According to the treaty, the government would 
                    provide the tribes with a variety of basic services and training, 
                    housing, food and supplies, including guns and ammunition 
                    for hunting. The goods would be allotted to the tribes each 
                    year for a thirty-year period and the Indian tribes would 
                    be allowed to continue to &quot;<i>hunt on any lands south 
                    of the Arkansas River so long as the buffalo may range thereon</i>.&quot; 
                    In exchange, the Indians agreed to stop their attacks and 
                    raids. Ten chiefs endorsed the treaty and many tribal members 
                    moved voluntarily to the reservations.</p>
                  <p class="text">But the treaty was destined for failure. Commercial 
                    buffalo hunters essentially ignored the terms of the treaty 
                    as they moved into the area promised to the Southern Plains 
                    Indians. The great southern herd of American bison, lifeblood 
                    of the Southern Plains tribes, was all but exterminated in 
                    just four years&#151;from 1874 to 1878. The hunters slaughtered 
                    the animals by the thousands, sending the hides back East 
                    and leaving the carcasses to rot on the plains&#151;and the 
                    U.S. government did nothing to stop them. The disappearance 
                    of the buffalo impoverished the tribes and forced them to 
                    depend on reservation rations. </p>
                  <p class="text">The promises made by the U.S. government proved 
                    largely empty. Food was inadequate and of poor quality, while 
                    reservation restrictions were all but impossible for the Indians, 
                    who were used to roaming over the plains at will, to understand 
                    or accept. By late spring of 1874, discontent lay heavy on 
                    the reservations. As conditions continued to worsen many of 
                    the Indians who were still there now left to join with the 
                    renegade bands who had returned to the Texas plains. Among 
                    the Indians there was talk of war and killing, and of driving 
                    the white man from the land. </p>
                  <p class="text">During the spring of 1874 a leader and prophet 
                    for the Indians emerged in the person of Isa-tai of the Quahadi 
                    Band of Comanches. Isa-tai's medicine was viewed as being 
                    very strong and he was doing his best to incite a war against 
                    the whites. Because the majority of Indians now saw themselves 
                    as being in a desperate situation with the only alternative 
                    to starvation being war, it took little persuasion by Isa-tai 
                    to convince the Indian leaders they must strike back at the 
                    whites. Thus, a plan was formed that the Indians would attack 
                    and destroy the new settlement of buffalo hunters at Adobe 
                    Walls.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the early-morning hours of June 27, 1874 
                    some 300 Indians, led by Isa-tai and famed Comanche chief 
                    Quanah Parker, attacked the Adobe Walls post. The Indians 
                    planned to catch the whites by surprise and simply overpower 
                    them. Although the 28 hunters who occupied the post were vastly 
                    outnumbered, they were well armed with long-range rifles and 
                    were able to hold off the Indians. With their failure at Adobe 
                    Walls, many of the Indians began to spread out over the plains 
                    of Texas for one final grasp at the old ways of life. The 
                    increasing realization that their access to ancestral lands 
                    was diminishing encouraged many of the Indians to strike at 
                    the encroaching whites. The realization that the buffalo, 
                    their main source for survival, was quickly disappearing forced 
                    them to fight. For the Indians, this brought retaliation by 
                    the U.S. Army, defeat, and confinement to the hated reservations.</p>

                    the weapon adopted by the U.S. Army for cavalry use on the 
                    Plains.</div>
                  <p class="text">The attack on Adobe Walls by the Indians served 
                    as a catalyst for the U.S. Army to make plans to subdue the 
                    Southern Plains tribes once and for all. The new policy called 
                    for enrollment and protection of innocent and friendly Indians 
                    at their reservations, and pursuit and destruction of hostile 
                    Indians without regard for reservation or departmental boundaries. 
                    The primary objective of the military campaign of 1874 was 
                    the removal of the Indian groups from this area of Texas and 
                    the opening of the region to Anglo-American settlement. General 
                    Philip Sheridan later characterized the military operations 
                    as &quot;<i>not only comprehensive, but&#133;the most successful 
                    of any Indian Campaign in this country since its settlement 
                    by the whites</i>.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">The offensive utilized five columns converging 
                    on the general area of the Texas Panhandle and specifically 
                    upon the upper tributaries of the Red River where the Indians 
                    were believed to be. The strategy aimed at full encirclement 
                    of the region, thereby eliminating virtually all gaps through 
                    which the Indians might escape. Colonel Nelson A. Miles moved 
                    southward from Fort Dodge; Lieutenant Colonel John W. Davidson 
                    marched westward from Fort Sill; Lieutenant Colonel George 
                    P. Buell moved northwest from Fort Griffin; Colonel Ranald 
                    S. Mackenzie came northward from Fort Concho; and Major William 
                    R. Price marched eastward across the Panhandle from Fort Union. 
                    The plan called for the converging columns to maintain a continuous 
                    offensive until a decisive defeat had been inflicted on the 
                    Indians.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the Red River War of 1874, as many 
                    as 20 engagements between the U.S. Army and the Southern Plains 
                    Indians may have taken place across the Texas Panhandle region. 
                    The well-equipped Army kept the Indians on the run until eventually 
                    they could not run or fight any longer. The Red River War 
                    officially ended in June 1875 when Quanah Parker and his band 
                    of Quahadi Comanche entered Fort Sill and surrendered. The 
                    Indians were defeated and would never again freely roam the 
                    buffalo plains.</p>
