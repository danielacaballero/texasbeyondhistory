                  <br>
				  <p class="text">Prior to the Indian Wars of the mid-1870s, the 
                    preferred weapons of the U.S. Army were the Spencer repeating 
                    carbine and .50 caliber, single shot Springfield rifle and 
                    Sharps carbine. The Army selected the Springfield .45 caliber 
                    rifle in 1873 as the weapon for the infantry and the shorter 
                    carbine of the same caliber for the cavalry. These were the 
                    arms primarily used by the Army during the Red River War. 
                    Like the Springfield .50 caliber, the Springfield .45s were 
                    single shot weapons that had to be reloaded after each fired 
                    round. The best effective range for the Springfield .45 carbine 
                    was less than 400 yards, but significant hits could be made 
                    up to 600 yards. The bullet was driven out of the muzzle at 
                    a velocity of about 1,200 feet per second, and it could travel 
                    more than 1,000 yards </p>
                  <p class="text">Archeological evidence gathered from the Red 
                    River War battle sites indicates that the Indians were primarily 
                    using repeating rifles such as the Spencer that fired a .50 
                    caliber cartridge and could fire seven rounds before loading, 
                    and the Winchester or Henry rifles that fired a .44 caliber 
                    cartridge and could each hold up to 16 rounds of ammunition. 
                    Most likely, the Indians acquired the Spencers, Winchesters, 
                    and Henrys after the Civil War when large numbers of these 
                    weapons became available to frontier traders and gunrunners.</p>
                  <p class="text">With the Indians using repeating rifles and 
                    the Army using single shot weapons, it might appear that the 
                    Indians had the superior arms. In fact, many officers who 
                    served the Union during the Civil War and were familiar with 
                    the Spencer's firepower were very reluctant to exchange the 
                    repeating Spencer for the new single shot Springfield .45. 
                    So why did the Army change from the Spencer to the Springfield? 
                    There appear to be two main reasons the Army made the change&#151;one 
                    financial and one tactical. After the Civil War, the Army 
                    was forced to cut back on expenditures. The Army had recognized 
                    that a soldier armed with a repeating rifle would expend a 
                    large amount of ammunition during battle whether he had a 
                    clear target in sight or not. The belief was that with a single 
                    shot rifle, the soldier would become more efficient with his 
                    ammunition and take only clear shots at his target. </p>
                  <p class="text">Further, many officers had come to believe that 
                    the single shot Springfield was a weapon superior to the Spencer. 
                    The new .45 caliber Springfield cartridge had greater accuracy 
                    and velocity at long ranges. Many of the Army officers who 
                    had experienced warfare on the Plains realized they needed 
                    those advantages in combating what could be characterized 
                    as &quot;guerilla warfare.&quot; Indians tended to stay at 
                    a distance from the soldiers and to engage in close range 
                    combat only when the enemy was clearly outnumbered or could 
                    be surprised with a sudden attack. Therefore, even though 
                    the Spencer, Winchester, and Henry repeating rifles could 
                    fire more rounds in a shorter amount of time than the single-shot 
                    Springfield, it appears the Springfield, with its longer range, 
                    was the superior gun of the Indian Wars.</p>
                  <p class="text">There were weapons other than rifles and carbines 
                    that were used by the U.S. Army and the Indians during the 
                    Red River War. The Indians, for example, also used the bow 
                    and arrow. Metal arrowpoints that were either made by the 
                    Indians or were acquired through trade were found at several 
                    of the battle sites. Although bows and arrows may have played 
                    a part in the battles, the long range at which most of the 
                    fighting occurred during the battles did not allow the bow 
                    and arrow a prominent role.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1874, the U.S. Army also used the Colt single 
                    action Army revolver. This pistol fired six .45-caliber cartridges. 
                    The effective range of the Colt revolver dropped off rapidly 
                    over 60 yards. During the campaign, the Army employed various 
                    kinds of artillery as well. Colonel Nelson A. Miles, for example, 
                    had two Gatling guns that fired a .50 caliber bullet. The 
                    Gatling gun was capable of firing up to 300 rounds per minute. 
                    At the Battle of Red River on August 30, 1874, Col. Nelson 
                    Miles used the Gatling against the Southern Cheyenne&#151;the 
                    first time the gun was used in combat west of the Mississippi 
                    River. Miles also brought along a 10-pounder Parrott rifle, 
                    which was actually a small cannon. The Parrott rifle fired 
                    a shell that measured 8.8 inches long by 2.86 in diameter. 
                    The shell exploded upon impact and the shell casing became 
                    the shrapnel. The maximum range of the 10-pounder Parrott 
                    rifle at five degrees elevation was about 2,000 yards. </p>
                  <p class="text">Another piece of artillery that was used by 
                    the Army during the Red River War was the mountain howitzer. 
                    The howitzer was a short-barreled cannon designed to fire 
                    projectiles with relatively small powder charges at short 
                    ranges. The howitzer was capable of firing either the spherical 
                    shell or the cylindrical canister.</p>
