				  <p class="text">Though most of the battles of the Red River 
                    War were brief skirmishes that involved a small number of 
                    combatants and resulted in few casualties, a number of larger 
                    and more significant battles also occurred. These include 
                    the Battle of Red River, Sweetwater Creek, and Palo Duro Canyon. 
                    The battles of Lyman's Wagon Train and Buffalo Wallow also 
                    are notable. </p>
                  <p class="text">The first battle of the Red River War came on 
                    August 30, 1874, when troops of the Sixth Cavalry and Fifth 
                    Infantry under the command of Colonel Nelson A. Miles caught 
                    up with a large group of Southern Cheyenne near the Prairie 
                    Dog Town Fork of the Red River in what is now southern Armstrong 
                    and northern Briscoe counties, Texas. The military records 
                    describe the daylong Battle of Red River as a running battle 
                    across the rugged canyonlands north and south of the river. 
                    Though the Army soldiers numbered some 650 strong with two 
                    Gatling guns and a 10-pounder Parrott rifle, the Indians were 
                    able to hold them off long enough for the Indian families 
                    to safely escape up Tule Canyon and vanish across the Staked 
                    Plains. </p>
                  <p class="text">A week earlier, Major William R. Price and companies 
                    C, H, K, and L of the Eighth U.S. Cavalry had left Fort Union, 
                    New Mexico, and headed east toward the Texas Panhandle as 
                    the westernmost column in the campaign against the Southern 
                    Plains Indians. The column consisted of 216 soldiers and included 
                    two mountain howitzers and a large supply train. Crossing 
                    the Texas Panhandle south of the Canadian River, the column 
                    followed the old Fort Smith-Santa Fe Road. On September 4, 
                    Price divided his command, directing Captain Farnsworth to 
                    take H company, all of the wagons, and one howitzer toward 
                    Adobe Walls to establish a supply camp near there.</p>
                  <p class="text">Major Price took C, K, and L companies and one 
                    howitzer as the main column. On September 12, as the column 
                    moved northeast between Sweetwater Creek and the Dry Fork 
                    of the Washita River, they encountered a large band of Kiowa 
                    and Comanche Indians led by Kiowa chief Lone Wolf. The ensuing 
                    engagement, known as Price's Engagement or the Battle of Sweetwater 
                    Creek, took place along a high ridge north of Sweetwater Creek 
                    in present Wheeler County, Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">Though Major Price and the soldiers were not 
                    aware of it while the battle was occurring, a large number 
                    of Indian families apparently were behind the high ridge trying 
                    to evade the troopers and make their escape to the southwest. 
                    The Indian warriors likely were trying to lead the troops 
                    away from the women and children and were trying to keep the 
                    troops occupied long enough to give the families time to escape, 
                    which they did successfully. The running battle lasted some 
                    four hours and covered a distance of about seven miles.</p>
                  <p class="text">Meanwhile, Miles had decided to establish his 
                    headquarters camp on Red River and send a military escort 
                    under the command of Captain Wyllys Lyman with 36 empty supply 
                    wagons back toward Camp Supply in Indian Territory to restock 
                    the provisions. Lyman's command consisted of 36 infantry, 
                    20 cavalry, and 36 civilian teamsters, of whom only 10 were 
                    armed. </p>
                  <p class="text">On September 9, the train was returning to the 
                    Red River with supplies when it was attacked by a group of 
                    Kiowa and Comanche warriors at the divide between the Canadian 
                    and Washita rivers. The Indians began firing from long range, 
                    but the defensive maneuvers of the cavalry enabled the train 
                    to move 12 miles farther south until it reached a steep ravine 
                    about a mile north of the Washita River. As the train approached 
                    the river, the Indians began to press the attack and Lyman 
                    ordered the wagons to form into a protective corral for better 
                    defense. </p>
                  <p class="text">As the train was circling, a group of about 
                    70 warriors attacked from the right and rear of the train 
                    and almost overran the skirmish lines that had been established 
                    by the infantry. The skirmishers held and repulsed the attack 
                    but a sergeant named DeArmond was killed during the assault 
                    and Lieutenant Granville Lewis was severely wounded. One of 
                    the teamsters, a man by the name of Sandford, was mortally 
                    wounded while carrying ammunition to the troops. When the 
                    initial attack failed, the Indians retreated to the surrounding 
                    ridges and began to lay siege to the wagon train. It was later 
                    learned that, in addition to Lone Wolf, several other prominent 
                    chiefs also took part in the battle including Satanta and 
                    Big Tree.</p>
                  <p class="text">With the onset of darkness, the fighting fell 
                    off, but it was now apparent to Lyman that the Indians intended 
                    to continue their siege for an indefinite period and he ordered 
                    the men to dig rifle pits around the perimeter of the circled 
                    train to afford additional protection for the men. The next 
                    morning the Indians resumed their fire. On the night of September 
                    10, seeing that the situation was desperate, Lyman sent one 
                    of the scouts, W. F. Schmalsle, to Camp Supply to get help. 
                    As he left the wagon train, Schmalsle was chased by the Indians 
                    but he managed to evade them and he arrived at Camp Supply 
                    two days later. On the morning of September 12, the Indians 
                    began to abandon the siege.</p>
                  <p class="text">Later in the afternoon, a cold rainstorm set 
                    in and continued through the next day. Even though the command 
                    was almost out of supplies, Lyman decided not to try to move 
                    the train in the storm. Several of the horses had been injured 
                    and 22 mules for the wagons had been killed. In the early 
                    morning hours of September 14, Company K arrived from Camp 
                    Supply with medical aid and an ambulance. With the siege broken, 
                    Lyman moved out with the wagons and later that morning joined 
                    Colonel Miles. On the recommendation of Colonel Miles, 13 
                    of the troopers were awarded the Medal of Honor for their 
                    bravery in the fight and Lyman was eventually promoted for 
                    his performance.</p>
                  <p class="text">On the morning of September 12, 1874 about 125 
                    of the warriors who had laid siege to the Lyman wagon train 
                    decided to move south of the Washita River to join their families. 
                    As the warriors reached a small rise north of Gageby Creek 
                    they ran into a small detachment of six men from Colonel Miles' 
                    command who were riding with dispatches and were charged with 
                    locating Lyman's wagon train. The detachment consisted of 
                    civilian scouts Billy Dixon and Amos Chapman and four soldiers 
                    of the Sixth Cavalry. The ensuing engagement between the warriors 
                    and the six men has come to be known as the Battle of Buffalo 
                    Wallow.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Indians quickly encircled the couriers, 
                    stranding them with essentially no cover. The little group 
                    of men dismounted and prepared to fight. A Private Smith was 
                    given the horses reins to hold. Within moments of the battle's 
                    outbreak he was shot in the chest and fell to the ground as 
                    the horses stampeded. </p>
                  <p class="text">After about four hours of the Indians taunting 
                    and firing at them, all of the whites except Dixon had been 
                    wounded. He spotted a small buffalo wallow, a shallow depression 
                    on the plain. Determined to make use of what little cover 
                    there was, Dixon made a run for the wallow, and three of the 
                    other men quickly joined him. Once there, the men began digging 
                    with knives to deepen the depression, throwing the sandy soil 
                    up as a breastwork around the perimeter of the wallow. The 
                    two men who remained outside the wallow were Private Smith 
                    who had been shot first and was believed dead, and Chapman 
                    who had suffered a crippling wound to his leg. After several 
                    attempts, Dixon was able to reach Chapman and carry him back 
                    to the wallow.</p>
                  <p class="text">As the afternoon wore on, the men began to run 
                    low on ammunition and it was decided that the revolver and 
                    ammunition belt should be retrieved from the body of the dead 
                    Private Smith. One of the soldiers, a Private Rath, ran to 
                    the motionless body and recovered the items, but when he got 
                    back to the wallow he reported that Private Smith was still 
                    alive. Dixon and Rath made their way back to Smith and carried 
                    him back to the wallow, but it was obvious that he would not 
                    survive. &quot;<i>We could see that there was no chance for 
                    him. He was shot through the left lung and when he breathed 
                    the wind sobbed out of his back under the shoulder blade</i>,&quot; 
                    Dixon wrote in his memoirs. Later that night Private Smith 
                    died in his sleep.</p>
                  <p class="text">By mid-afternoon a storm came up and a heavy 
                    rain began to fall. As miserable as the men were in the buffalo 
                    wallow the storm had an unseen benefit. With the advent of 
                    the inclement weather, the Indians broke off the fight and 
                    disappeared into the night.</p>
                  <p class="text">The next morning Dixon left the wallow on foot 
                    to try to find help for the wounded men. After a short while, 
                    he encountered the Eighth Cavalry under Major Price's command. 
                    Upon learning of their situation, Colonel Miles had the men 
                    rescued. Although all six men were awarded the Congressional 
                    Medal of Honor, Dixon's and Chapman's were later revoked because 
                    they were not officially enlisted in the Army. In 1989, the 
                    Army Board for Correction of Military Records restored the 
                    medals to Dixon and Chapman.</p>
                  <p class="text">The critical battle of the Red River War began 
                    as the sun rose on September 28, 1874. At least five Indian 
                    villages had sought protection in the hidden isolation of 
                    Palo Duro Canyon. Then Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, in command 
                    of the Fourth Cavalry, charged into the canyon. With their 
                    people scattered, Indian leaders Iron Shirt of the Cheyenne, 
                    Poor Buffalo of the Comanche, and Lone Wolf of the Kiowa could 
                    not mount a united defense and fell back before the onrushing 
                    horsemen. The soldiers captured and burned the villages, including 
                    the Indians' winter food supply. They also captured 1,424 
                    Indian horses that they drove some 20 miles from the scene 
                    of the fight where they killed more than 1,000 of the horses 
                    to prevent them from being retaken by the Indians.</p>
                  <p class="text">After this battle, with no provisions to see 
                    them through the winter and with no horses, many of the Indians 
                    began to drift back to the reservations. Over the next several 
                    months, the U.S. Army would sweep the remaining Indian holdouts 
                    from the Texas Panhandle and force them onto the reservations. 
                    Thus ended the Indian War on the Southern Plains.</p>
