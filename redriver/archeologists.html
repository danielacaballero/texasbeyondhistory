                  <p class="text">Survey in the rugged Texas Panhandle can be 
                    grueling work, but the archeologists heading up the Red River 
                    battle site investigations were well suited for the job. Brett 
                    Cruse served as Project Director, leading Texas Historical 
                    Commission crews as well as volunteers in field investigations 
                    during 1998 and 1999. </p>
                  <p class="text">Cruse is a native of Turkey, Texas, a small 
                    farming and ranching community in the Panhandle. Brett received 
                    a B.S. in anthropology from West Texas State (A&amp;M) University 
                    and an M.A. in anthropology from Texas A&amp;M University. 
                    After working on various archeological field projects in the 
                    south, southwest, and eastern U.S., he joined the staff of 
                    the Texas Historical Commission in 1995 where he serves as 
                    the Regional Archeologist for the Plains Region and Project 
                    Director for the Red River War Battle Sites Project. </p>
                  <p class="text">Patricia Mercado-Allinger is the Texas State Archeologist. 
                    Pat is a &quot;Texan by choice&quot; having grown up in Southern 
                    California, where she spent many hours during her childhood 
                    roaming the golf course where her father was the greenskeeper. 
                    In fact, she credits her interest in archeology to her golf 
                    course wanderings because she observed numerous artifacts 
                    that piqued her curiosity about the toolmakers and the uses 
                    and antiquity of the objects.</p>
                  <p class="text">Both her B.A. and M.A. degrees in anthropology 
                    were earned at the University of Arizona, Tucson. She moved 
                    to Texas in 1979, working as the park archeologist at Caprock 
                    Canyons State Park. Later, while employed by a private consulting 
                    firm in Austin, she worked on projects throughout Texas and 
                    in southwestern Missouri.</p>
                  <p class="text">Mercado-Allinger has been with the Texas Historical 
                    Commission since December 1984 and has served as State Archeologist 
                    since 1996. She is also an active member of the Texas Archeological 
                    Society, serving on numerous committees and as president in 
                    1990. </p>
