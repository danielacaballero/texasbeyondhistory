				  <p class="text">The Red River War led to the final confinement 
                    of the southern Plains Indians on reservations in Indian Territory. 
                    With their removal from Texas, the western half of the state 
                    was opened to Anglo-American settlement. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Recognizing the historical significance of 
                    the Red River War, the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical 
                    Commission (THC) initiated the Red River War Battle Sites 
                    Project in 1998. Our goal was to precisely locate and document 
                    the more significant sites, to nominate them for inclusion 
                    in the National Register of Historic Places and to evaluate 
                    each of the sites for heritage tourism potential. During 1998 
                    and 1999, THC archeologists conducted archeological investigations 
                    at the sites of the battles of Adobe Walls, Red River, Lyman's 
                    Wagon Train, Buffalo Wallow, and Sweetwater Creek.</p>
                  <p class="text">The two seasons of fieldwork at the Red River 
                    War battle sites were tremendously successful. More than 3,000 
                    battle-related artifacts were recovered and precise boundaries 
                    for the battle sites were identified. For the most part, the 
                    investigations have shown that the sites have remained relatively 
                    undisturbed during the more than 125 years since the battles 
                    occurred. As result, we have new interpretations about specific 
                    battle events and information regarding arms and ammunition 
                    used by the U.S. Army and the Southern Plains Indians. The 
                    investigations are also serving to corroborate some of the 
                    historical accounts of the battles, while contradicting other 
                    historical records. Analysis of the recovered artifacts suggests, 
                    for example, that there were not as many Indian participants 
                    at the battles and they were not as well armed as some of 
                    the military reports indicate.</p>
                  <p class="text">The archeological methods that were used during 
                    the investigations of the battle sites involved several steps. 
                    First, the archeological team, equipped with metal detectors, 
                    systematically scanned the study area for metal artifacts. 
                    When the metal detectors indicated the presence of a metal 
                    object buried in the ground or on the surface, that place 
                    was marked with a surveyor's pin flag. The metal object was 
                    then excavated and left in place. If the artifact appeared 
                    to be related to the battle, it was assigned a unique identification 
                    number. This number was written on the pin flag, and the flag 
                    was left in place so the artifact could be recorded. Each 
                    artifact was then mapped in place and collected. To map the 
                    artifacts we used a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 
                    with sub-meter accuracy. The GPS data was then imported into 
                    a computer-mapping program and overlaid onto topographic maps 
                    to produce precise maps showing the location of each battle-related 
                    artifact. </p>
                  <p class="text">The archeological investigations at the battle 
                    sites have provided a clearer picture of how the battles unfolded, 
                    including the positions on the battlefields of the Army soldiers 
                    and the Indian warriors, as well as the lines of advance and 
                    retreat of the combatants. The investigations have served 
                    to support some of the historical accounts of the battles, 
                    while questioning other accounts. For example, the investigations 
                    at the Battle of Red River site have substantiated the historical 
                    accounts that the battle was a running battle that covered 
                    a distance of some 12 miles before the Indians broke away 
                    and escaped up Tule Canyon. Our studies also provided conclusive 
                    evidence that the Army indeed used the Gatling gun during 
                    the battle, which marks the first time the weapon was used 
                    in combat west of the Mississippi River and the first time 
                    it was used against Native Americans. </p>
                  <p class="text">Our data also indicates that the Indians may 
                    not have been as well armed as many of the military documents 
                    and reports seem to suggest. At every battle site investigated 
                    we discovered that there were approximately four U.S. Army 
                    cartridges recovered from the sites for every one Indian cartridge. 
                    In addition, we found that the majority of the Indian cartridges 
                    were Spencers of types that were not manufactured after 1866, 
                    a full eight years prior to battles. This suggests that the 
                    Indians were conserving their ammunition and using it only 
                    sparingly. </p>
                  <h3>Future Directions for the Red River War Project 
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text">Military reports, maps and other historic documents 
                    have provided critical information on the Red River War of 
                    1874-1875. Artifacts and their distribution at the battle 
                    sites have filled in many other important details. But to 
                    fully understand what happened during the Red River War the 
                    Indian perception of the events is needed. Army officials 
                    interrogated some of the tribal leaders after the war's end, 
                    and these interviews appear in Army records. The THC team 
                    is gathering and reviewing military documents for details 
                    about the Indian leaders who participated in the battles. 
                    There may be other tribal stories that have been passed down 
                    through the generations since the war. THC plans to make contacts 
                    with the tribes that were involved with the conflict. If tribal 
                    accounts of the war exist and the Indians are willing to share 
                    them, the stories will be recorded. These stories would surely 
                    contribute to a more complete understanding of this chapter 
                    of Texas history.</p>
                  <p class="text">The results of the THC's Red River War Project 
                    will be reported in a variety of ways. The information will 
                    be published and a plan will be developed with area museums 
                    to create a series of interpretive exhibits about the war. 
                    It is important to share the project results in this way since 
                    the battle sites investigated by the THC are all located on 
                    private property-on working ranches in most cases-with no 
                    public access. By creating partnerships with museums in the 
                    region, students, history buffs, and interested travelers 
                    will be able to learn more about the Red River War.</p>
