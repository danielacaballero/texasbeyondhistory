    <td width="480" valign="top"><p align="left">On a cold winter day in 1686, the small French ship<em> Belle</em> ran aground on the Texas coast, the victim of a run of bad luck and a howling north wind. The  <em>Belle</em> was the last of four ships of  the expedition led by Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle. La Salle had come to  establish a colony near the mouth of the Mississippi River with multiple aims that included providing a warm-water port to serve the fur trade and a base for  invading Mexico. France and Spain were then at war, and La Salle, with the backing of his king, intended to challenge Spain's domination of the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
      <p align="left">This was not La Salle's first journey to the New World. In 1669 La Salle had set out to explore  the Great Lakes region of North America. By  1682 he had reached the Illinois  country, establishing trading posts along the way. From the mouth of the  Illinois River, he began a journey of more than a thousand miles, following the  Mississippi River to its mouth in the Gulf of Mexico.  There he laid claim, in the name of Louis XIV, king of France, to roughly one-third of the territory of  today&rsquo;s continental United    States. In  light of such monumental  successes and the hope of conquering more territory&mdash;including the Spanish  silver mines in northern Mexico&mdash;the king was persuaded to back La Salle&rsquo;s  grandiose plan, providing ships, supplies, and personnel to carry out his  vision. The king&rsquo;s largesse, however, had limits. Whereas La   Salle saw a need for four ships, the monarch agreed to provide  only two: the small frigate <em>Belle</em> and  the escorting warship <em>Joly</em>. To  augment his force La Salle&mdash;drawing ever more  heavily on borrowed money&mdash;leased from private merchants two additional vessels, <em>L&rsquo;Aimable </em>and the ketch <em>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois,</em> and purchased additional  trade goods and supplies.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Sailing into History </h3>
      <p align="left">The small fleet embarked from the French port of La Rochelle with high hopes of establishing a French colony on the Gulf and fulfilling La Salle's dream. Misfortunes began before the  expedition reached the Antilles. On the coast of Haiti the <em>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois </em>was seized by pirates. Further along on the journey,    grievous  errors in maps and knowledge of geography  led La Salle to believe the mouth of  the Mississippi  lay much farther west than it actually was. In January 1685 the remaining three  ships made landfall on the Texas coast, some  400 miles from the Mississippi.  The landing site was in the territory of the Karankawa, whose  enmity the French soon aroused. It was uncharted territory, with no European  settlement nearer than hostile Mexico  or the post La Salle had established in Illinois.</p>
      <p align="left">Episodes of misfortune&mdash;made worse  by inept leadership&mdash;rose in succession. A major setback was the wrecking of  the <em>Aimable,</em> the store-ship carrying  most of the would-be colony&rsquo;s supplies, which ran aground while trying to enter  Matagorda Bay. A large portion of the supplies  and provisions was lost as the ship broke up and sank. The warship <em>Joly</em>, due to return to France once La  Salle reached his intended destination, carried <em>L&rsquo;Aimable</em>&rsquo;s crew and a few persons who recognized the   futility of the colony and refused to stay.&nbsp; Left  behind was an array of fearful and homesick colonists who had no idea where  they were.</p>
      <p align="left">While La Salle sought the Mississippi, a temporary settlement was set up  on the bank of Garcitas Creek  some five miles above its mouth in Lavaca   Bay. The small complex of crude structures afforded scant  protection from the unruly Karankawans, however, who waited in ambush for those who left  the settlement singly or in small groups. Hardly worthy of being termed a fort, the settlement has been called <a href="../stlouis/index.html" target="_blank">Fort St. Louis</a> only because of historical error. </p>
      <p align="left">With the settlement complete, La Salle loaded the<em> Belle</em> in readiness for making a sea search for the Mississippi. He placed on board items  that would be needed if he should find his river and fulfill his plan to move  the settlement there. He then embarked on a mysterious journey westward,  leaving the <em>Belle </em>in an insecure  anchorage in the charge of the  ship's mate, Tessier, who was often in a drunken state. </p>
      <p align="left">In La Salle&rsquo;s  absence, misfortune plagued the <em> Belle.</em> Already the ship&rsquo;s complement of 27 men had been reduced by the death of the  captain and five members of his crew who were caught away from the ship and  murdered by the vengeful Karankawa. Six  others, including the most experienced sailors who gone ashore in the  ship&rsquo;s lifeboat for water, either drowned in the bay while returning to the  ship at night or were slain by&nbsp; Indians.  Loss of the lifeboat proved crucial. </p>
      <p align="left">Without water, the remaining crew  suffered severe hydration&mdash;all except Tessier, who took charge of the store of  sacramental wine. At last anchor was weighed to seek a more favorable location,  but too late. A fierce northerly wind arose, and the unskilled and enfeebled  crew was unable to work the rigging. In desperation, they dropped the bow  anchor, but it failed to hold. As the ship was driven southward across the bay,  the anchor dragged until the ship plunged stern first into the reef of barrier  sand known today as Matagorda   Peninsula. Still some  distance from shore, the crew was unable to free the ship. Lacking the  lifeboat, two men attempted to reach the shore with a poorly constructed raft.  The raft came apart; one man swam ashore, but the other drowned. At last a more  solid raft was built, and the crew was able to set up camp on the beach and  ferry supplies from the wreck until the ship began to settle into the bottom and  the cargo became submerged.</p>
      <p align="left">For three months the <em>Belle</em>&rsquo;s castaways remained isolated on  the peninsular strip of sand, lacking the leadership of a resolute captain and  a boat for crossing the bay. For sustenance, they supplemented provisions saved  from the ship by fishing, gathering oysters, and shooting ducks. At last,  however, they began to feel the pinch of hunger and set out to look for the  means of escape. By good fortune, a canoe that had escaped the French on the  far side of Pass Cavallo turned up at the water&rsquo;s edge. Thus, the castaways  were finally able to cross the bay to reach the settlement. Of all those whom La Salle had  left&nbsp; on board <em>the Belle</em>&mdash;including the original crew of 27 and several men he had  placed there in irons&mdash;only half a dozen survived: the mate Tessier, the Abb&eacute;  Chefdeville, the useless Marquis de Sablonni&egrave;re, a soldier, a young lad, and a  servant girl from Saint-Jean-d&rsquo;-Ang&eacute;ly</p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile, La Salle himself, with a few  followers, had marched eastward, hoping to reach the post on the Illinois River. When nearing the country of the &ldquo;Cenis,&rdquo;  or Hasinai, in eastern Texas,  he was brutally murdered by his own men. Almost two years later, a Karankawa band,  feigning friendship, fell upon the twenty-odd persons remaining at the  settlement on Garcitas Creek. Only half a dozen children were spared, to be  ransomed later by Spaniards and taken to Mexico    City. More than a year after the  <em>Belle</em>&rsquo;s loss, she was discovered by a Spanish expedition that  had come looking for La Salle. The discovery was recorded in the diary of the pilot, Juan Enr&iacute;quez Barroto,   who recognized the little frigate as a warship from its six pieces of artillery   and five swivel guns. The starboard side, the deck, and the prow were under   water. The Spanish pilot&rsquo;s description of the location would point the way for   archeologists three centuries later.</p>
      <h3 align="left"><strong>An Unprecedented Excavation </strong></h3>
      <p align="left">The <em>Belle</em> remained mired in mud for 310 years, untouched but not forgotten. After years of unsuccessful searching, archeologists from the Texas Historical Commission (THC) finally found the prize in 1995. The crew discovered one of the <em>Belle's</em> cannons, an elaborately inscribed gun that confirmed the age and identity of the wreck. </p>
      <p align="left">Properly excavating the shipwreck would require one of the most extraordinary engineering feats ever associated with an archeological excavation in Texas or anywhere else in the world. In 1996, at a cost of over $2 million, a  double-walled cofferdam was built around the sunken ship. This allowed THC archeologists  to pump out the wreck site and excavate the <em>Belle</em> almost as if they were on dry land. </p>
      <p align="left">The nine-month excavation yielded equally astonishing results: gooey gray mud had encased the <em>Belle</em> and sealed its contents  from the air. Most of the ship's stores&#8212;wooden boxes jammed with trade goods, tools to support a variety of trades,   muskets and munitions, yards of  rope, cannons, dishes, and more&#8212;were found in remarkably good condition. Here, for the first time, was an intact 17th-century French colonizing kit containing everything needed to establish a colony in the New World. </p>
      <p align="left">Even the ship's hull and timbers were  intact&#8212;though water-logged and fragile&#8212;still looking very much like they did when La Salle last saw them. The timbers still bore the original numbers carved into each piece to aid the ship's builders in assembling the <em>Belle</em>. For archeologists and others interested in Texas history, the quantities of astonishingly well-preserved artifacts and the ship itself represent a far more valuable and informative treasure than gold bars and silver coins. (Those, too, have been recovered from a shipwreck on the Texas coast, but that is another story.) </p>
      <p align="left">The THC's unprecedented excavation was completed in 1997 under the direction of Dr. James Bruseth, director of the Archaeological Division. But the discoveries from <em>La Belle</em> did not  end  in Matagorda Bay. The thousands  of recovered artifacts, dozens of wooden chests and barrels, and the complete  set of ship&rsquo;s timbers were brought to the Texas A&amp;M Conservation Research Laboratory, where a  painstaking process of cleaning, documentation, and preservation was  undertaken under the direction of Dr. Donny Hamilton. Over a period of nine years, enormous concretions of artifacts and other  remains were picked apart, conserved, analyzed, and identified, an undertaking tantamount  to a second &ldquo;excavation&rdquo; of the shipwreck. Analysts from across the country also have joined in the process and have provided comparative information from other 17th-century French sites. </p>
      <p align="left">To date, more than one million artifacts from the <em>Belle </em> have been conserved and catalogued, and many of these objects are now on display in Texas museums. The ship's hull has been reassembled in a giant vat filled with water and a stabilizing compound that is gradually replacing the water and hardening the wet wood. The reconstructed <em>Belle</em> ultimately will be on display for public viewing in the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin. Regional museums along the coast have joined in partnership to help present this slice of early Texas history to the public. The La Salle Odyssey Trail guides visitors to six museums with pertinent exhibits on La Salle, <em>La Belle</em>, and the short-lived French settlement, Fort St. Louis. </p>
      <p align="left">The story of<em> La Belle</em> did not end with its excavation and analysis. Three hundred years after its sailing, the French government made claim to the shipwreck and all its contents, based on the International Law of the Sea, a doctrine which gives ownership of official naval vessels to the &quot;flag nation,&quot; the country whose flag the ship flies. In 2003, however, following negotiations between the THC, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and representatives of the French government, a treaty was signed conceding ownership to France but giving day-to-day care of <em>La Belle</em> to the Texas Historical Commission. </p>
      <h3 align="left">In This Exhibit </h3>
<p align="left">This exhibit is a  collaborative effort among researchers in several institutions to bring the story of <em>La Belle </em>to a world-wide audience via<em> Texas Beyond History</em>.
