The main, or forward, hold, contained a remarkably intact trove of cargo: 63 wooden casks and 7 crates, still tightly packed in place and filled with an array of items. From household materials and construction tools to glimmering trade goods, these were the supplies intended for the Mississippi River colony that La Salle had ordered loaded on board <em>La Belle</em> in 1685, shortly before the vessel was wrecked in the bay. Munitions also were laid in, including two bronze cannons, cannonballs, swords, flintlock muskets, and barrels containing hundreds of pounds of lead shot. 
The main hold also housed equipment critical to ship operations, such as pumps for removing water from the bilge.
