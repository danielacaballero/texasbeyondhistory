Archeologists found that roughly 40 per cent of <em>La Belle&apos;s</em> hull and a quarter of her rigging elements were preserved.  As they washed the mud from the ship&apos;s wooden skeleton, the investigators made another surprising discovery: each timber was labeled with a Roman numeral.  This indicated that the ship had been assembled from a French kit made up of carefully numbered pieces to guide the shipwrights, or even less experienced builders, in the construction process. Although La Salle originally had planned to carry the ship kit within one of the larger vessels on the expedition, a change in plans forced him to assemble <em>La Belle</em> in Rouen, France, and sail it, loaded with cargo, with his other three vessels on the voyage to the New World. 
Study of the remains tells us that <em>La Belle</em> had been a three-masted sailing ship, or <em>barque longue</em>. Based on a 1684 handwritten construction order for the ship, discovered in a marine archive in Rochefort, France, original dimensions were 54 feet 4 inches long by 14 feet 9 inches wide.  With a draft of about eight feet, the vessel would have been well suited for navigating relatively shallow rivers and streams.
