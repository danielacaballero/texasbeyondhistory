Excavators working on the shipwreck found that a major portion of the hull was still intact, with much of the cargo preserved. Remarkably, many of the wooden barrels, casks, and boxes were still packed in the compartments, just as La Salle&apos;s crew had placed them some 300 years before.  Here were the ingredients for creating a colony in the new world: tools to fell trees and construct buildings; food, dishes, clothing and other supplies for daily life; weaponry for defense and hunting; and small, glittering items intended for trade with the native peoples. The ship&apos;s hull itself carried a trove of clues, large and small, about shipbuilding and sailing in the 17th century. It was dismantled timber by timber to be brought to shore, reassembled, studied, and preserved. To the archeologists, La Belle was a treasure far more valuable than gold or silver.
