The majority of  the earthenware vessels were made of coarse clays glazed with lead, and were generally not highly fired.   Most were manufactured in the Saintonge region of France, roughly 70 miles from  La Rochelle, the port from which <em>La Belle</em> set sail. Researchers from the Texas Historical Commission have traced the green-glazed pottery, such as the plate shown in the center, even more specifically to the small village of La Chapelle des Pots, where family pottery workshops  operated. Stoneware vessels, such as the gray-colored pitcher, or cruet, shown in the center, were more highly fired and used for holding  liquids. At forefront is a small, unglazed stoneware vessel from the Beauvaisis region. It  held mercury,  which was used for medicinal purposes. <!-- #EndEditable --></td>
