This page describes the movements of <em>La Belle</em> as she lay off the Texas coast waiting for the ship, <em>Le Joly</em>, as well as communications with the <em>Aimable</em>, and crewmembers' voyage by longboat to search for fresh water. How this page and three others from the ship's log survived is a remarkable tale. It is belived that Captain Tessier rescued the log and carried it to Fort St. Louis. During the Karankawa attack and ransacking of the fort, pages of the log were likely among the spoils. According to an account in the archives of Seville, the log pages, wrapped in lace,  were carried by four Jumano and Cibolo chiefs to Governor Juan Ysidro de Pardi&ntilde;as Villar de Francos in the remote Spanish settlement of Nuevo Vizcayo in 1689. To the Spanish, these documents were telltale evidence of the activities of the French on the northern frontier of new Spain.
