The bow compartment of the ship was used by sailors as a place for rest, one of the few areas where they could escape the elements. When the opportunity arose, tired sailors crawled through the deck hatch into the cramped bow quarters, where hammocks or wooden bunks may have been positioned. It was in this forward hold that archeologists made their most poignant discovery. Atop a coiled mound of anchor rope, the skeletal remains of an unknown Frenchman lay sprawled face down, elbows splayed outward.  Near him were a pewter salver, or wine-tasting cup, stamped with the name, "C. Barange", and a leather pouch containing two combs. A single leather shoe and a wooden cask, perhaps once containing water, lay close by. A Jesuit ring was found among the hand bones and nearby, several wooden beads. 
Despite a variety of attempts to discover the sailor&apos;s identity, we may never know whether the skeleton was an individual known as C. Barange, nor the circumstances of his death.  Attempts to extract DNA from the remains were unsuccessful, largely because of destruction by marine creatures.  A reconstruction of his face, however, by a University of Michigan medical artist, provides us an idea of what he may have looked like. (See Treasures of La Belle section for photo and detail.) 
In "From a Watery Grave, The Discovery and Excavation of La Salle&apos;s Shipwreck, La Belle," authors James Bruseth and Toni Turner imagine what the end was like for him:  "The archeological evidence portrays a miserable sailor desperately clinging to life, probably lying on one of the wooden bunks overlooking the anchor rope in the bottom of the bow. It is likely he died before the ship sank. After the wreck, his body was dislodged from the bunk and dropped to the bottom of the bow, settling directly on the coiled anchor rope, with his empty water cask falling next to him."
Three-hundred years after his lonely passing, the unknown sailor has now gained a measure of respect and even notoriety.  On February 3, 2004, his remains were buried with honor at the state cemetery in Austin.  Officials from Texas, the United States and France were in attendance, along with a cadre of archeologists who helped recover his remains from the sea.
