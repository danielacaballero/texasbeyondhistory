    <td><p align="left" class="style4">The skull is a hard bony structure that may appear to be one solid globe. Actually, it is made up of 29 bones! The bones of the upper part, or brain case, support and surround all that gray matter—yep, the brain.  Attaching to the brain case are the many complex structures that make up the face. Here you will find the two orbits (openings for the eyes) and the two nasals (for the nose). There are also the bones that make up the inner ear. These structures hold your major sensory organs that allow you to see, smell, and hear!
The lower part of the skull includes the jawbones (mandible and maxilla) and teeth which you can read all about in another section.

It appeared that he had suffered a blow to the left side of his face, breaking his left nasal bone. This may have been a punch thrown by someone who was right-handed. Or something could have fallen on him.  Ouch!</p>
      <p align="left" class="style4"><strong>DNA:</strong> Inside the skull, researchers found that almost the entire brain was still intact.  His skull really did its job of protecting the brain! Unfortunately, there was no usable DNA in his brain tissue. It had been invaded by tiny marine microorganisms.  Sea critters!  </p></td>

We had to hold it in an inverted position to keep the brain from running all over the table! The brain was removed by pouring ethanol and water into the skull. This made the tissue float out easily, but it felt like soggy dressing from a Thanksgiving turkey!

      <br>Have you ever seen TV detectives recreate a murder victim’s face so it could be identified?  Well, scientists can recreate a dead person’s face just by using the skull. To recreate our sailor’s face, scientists first put his skull through a hospital CT (computer tomography) scanner to make very fine, 3D computer images of it. This allowed them to see what his head looked like from any angle.</p>

    <td><p align="left" class="style5">Then, using the CT pictures, technicians created a resin cast, or model, of his skull, onto which a medical illustrator then applied bits of clay, shaping it to match face muscles. Finally, another layer of clay was added to look like the sailor’s skin. His body measurements tell us that the sailor was probably a white man, but we have no way of knowing his hair and beard color or length. Many men during this sailor’s time did have long hair and beards, so perhaps he did, too.
