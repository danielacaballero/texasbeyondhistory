    <td><p>Most of the people who sailed on La Belle originally came from France, so researchers wondered if our skeletal sailor might be related to families living in France today. Since the skeleton was found lying next to a cup with the name, C. Barange, they hoped to look for members of the Barange family in France and compare their DNA with that of the sailor. </p></td>

<p>First they had to take a look at the sailor’s DNA. We know that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is present in every cell of the human body and can sometimes be used to help identify and match up family members. So scientists took samples of his brain tissue,  his right leg bones,  his teeth, and one of his ribs to look for his DNA. </p>
<p>All the samples contained DNA, but none of it was human! The sailor’s DNA had been contaminated by bacteria and sea organisms that had been living on his skeleton for over 300 years!  So, unfortunately, scientists have not been able to genetically link our Mr. C. Barange with any modern-day relatives. Maybe new techniques will allow us to get better samples and help solve this puzzle some day in the future! </p></td>
