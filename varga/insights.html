    <td width="480" height="500" valign="top">    <p style="margin-top: 0">For approximately 6,300 years,  native peoples periodically camped at the Varga site on Hackberry Creek,  hunting and gathering a variety of foods to eat and resources to use for their shelters  and tools. In this exhibit, we have sought not only to trace their activities, but  also to bring to the forefront the various technical analyses used to develop  those interpretations. We have included a considerable amount of detail about  the methods used in these studies in order to show that it is not a simple  process to extract meaningful information from the  bits and pieces  recovered from archeological sites. Although eight types of studies are  highlighted in this exhibit, several others, including optimically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of sediments and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, were conducted to  maximize the opportunity for learning about the past. Taken as a  whole, the results from this broad suite of analyses provide new insights into the past, some with regional  consequence, others of lesser importance but of interest to researchers.</p>
      <p>     
      Four components, or major use periods, at the Varga site were identified  and analyzed. We learned that throughout most periods, native campers at the  site employed the same cooking technologies and made similar formal and  informal chipped-stone tools. They relied predominantly on Edwards chert for their  raw material. During the last 600-year period, the Toyah group(s) added two new  technologies: the bow and arrow for hunting, which replaced the atlatl and dart system, and ceramic pottery, which was added to hot-rock techniques for cooking.</p>
      <p> Projectile points, bifaces, end scrapers, and   edge-modified flakes dominate the cultural artifacts recovered from each of the   four major camping events represented.&nbsp; These stone tools are generally   considered evidence of intensive hunting and meat processing activities.&nbsp; Ground stone tools typically associated with plant processing, such as manos and metates, were nearly absent from all assemblages. &nbsp;Based   on the artifacts alone, including the bones from the Toyah interval, one    would normally draw the conclusion that the occupants of these camps focused solely on animal   resources.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It was only through various technical analyses,  however, including the use of lipid residues and stable isotopes on the burned rocks, plus the  microscopic residues observed on chipped-stone tools during use-wear analysis, that   the use of plant resources at this site was  documented. </strong>These findings  are particularly valuable because plants typically are poorly preserved in open  sites such as Varga.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Analysis of lipids, or fatty acids, on pottery sherds and  burned rocks, while not specific in plant/animal identifications, nonetheless provided important  clues to the foods consumed at the site, including  the ways in which they were prepared. These findings underlined  the dietary importance of plants to Varga campers. Nearly 80% of the burned  rocks and ceramic samples analyzed were found to contain plant residues. Plants  apparently were  cooked both in ceramic containers as well as in pits or oven  features that used hot rocks as cooking elements.&nbsp;  Although there were numerous animal bones, including deer and bison, found  at the site, the lipid analyses revealed surprisingly little direct evidence of cooking the meat. The lack of bison lipid residues on  burned   rocks from the Toyah component appears to indicate that meats were not cooked by these rocks.&nbsp;These varied findings suggest  that  meat was primarily eaten raw or dried (beef jerkey). </p>
      <p>
      Use-wear analyses of  stone tools from the Toyah component also emphasized the importance of plants  during this time period.&nbsp; About 70% of the  findings support use of tools on plants, while less than 15% indicate use on  animals.&nbsp; Use-wear studies  also revealed that the general shape of tools does not provide an adequate  indication of tasks for which the tool was used, nor  the material on which it  was used. For example, use-wear on edge-modified flakes revealed many tasks  that would have gone undetected, such as whittling and planing wood, scraping plant materials, and slicing meat. Further, the haft position on certain tools  indicated different uses other than what  more traditional  forms of morphological tool classification might suggest. For example, several Cliffton points, a type of artifact widely believed to be Perdiz preforms, showed evidence of hafting. This indicates these Cliffton points were not preforms; rather, they had been hafted to a shaft and used. </p>
      <p>
        Instrumental Neutron  Activation Analysis (INAA) on stone tools, raw cherts, and ceramics provided a  greater understanding of the procurement territory, or resource zones, of the  Varga site occupants and the distance the raw materials were transported. It  appears that, with few exceptions, most materials used to make the Varga tools and  vessels were derived from nearby sources. This localized, or spatially  constrained, operational area holds true in the Toyah component. This is rather interesting,  given the widespread distribution of classic Toyah assemblages throughout much  of the state.
        <p>Petrographic analyses  provided specifics on pottery-making technology at the Varga site. These findings can now  be compared to pottery from other sites.&nbsp;  For example, the Varga ceramics contained an average of 36% ground bone  particles used as temper, about 12% higher than other Toyah ceramics from  the Rush and O. H.  Ivie sites to the northeast, and the Onion Creek sites in south central Texas. On these sites, the bone  temper average was about 24%. Although use of bone temper in Toyah ceramic  technology is widespread across central Texas,  variations in the amount may indicate choices of individual potters,  differences in how the pots were used, and/or condition of the raw clay.</p>
        <p>
        Comparisons between ceramics from prehistoric sites and Historic Period mission  sites also show specific similarities and differences.&nbsp;The Varga study  showed the changes which took place among native potters in mission  settings. One was  the <strong>&nbsp;</strong>adoption of new pastes and tempering  sources; another was the reduction  of the common use of bone temper (although  note that some prehistoric pastes also lack bone).&nbsp; In the Historic  period, we see the coexistence of several ceramic paste groups, followed by the  gradual replacement of native, handmade pottery  by that made on a mechanical wheel.</p>
        <p>
        The diverse paleoenvironmental  data obtained from multiple lines of evidence and interpretations indicate very minor changes to the past climate and vegetation communities during the 6300 years  represented at this locale. &nbsp;A hint at a  possible change to drier or warmer conditions is the appearance of  bison and antelope in the Toyah subsistence base within the last 600 years.  The appearance of these two species in  the Toyah component potentially reflects the presence of more open grasslands  during this period. However, human selection cannot be ruled out. This relatively  minor change in the environment may have influenced human behavior and  adaptation, resulting in repeated use of this locality and contributing to the  relative consistency in the archeological record from the Varga site. </p>
        <p>Additional information about the prehistoric environment was gleaned through  stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses.&nbsp; In   general, these two sets of values can be used to understand possible changes   through time in past vegetation communities.&nbsp; Here, the nitrogen values changed   very little.&nbsp; The carbon values showed increased negative values from oldest to   recent.&nbsp; The latter increase of negative values over time reflects increase in   flowering shrubs and trees.&nbsp; There was no real indication of zonation in the   obtained values to reflect the visible soil stratigraphic boundaries.&nbsp; The   negative carbon values also indicate there were few or no grasses that grow in   warm/dry conditions.&nbsp; Therefore, this isotopic record shows no sign of the   previously identified warm/dry Altithermal climatic period documented   elsewhere.&nbsp; The Altithermal is generally thought to have existed between 6000   and 4500 years before present.&nbsp; The use of multiple technical analyses as done   here, including pollen, phytolith, and isotope, strengthens and documents   the finding that a significant warm and/or dry Altithermal period was not present at the   Varga site. </p>
        <p>An additional  analysis also was performed to help date the site occupations. Six fine-grained alluvial sediment samples that   contained few sand-grained size particles were relatively dated through   optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).&nbsp; These samples were collected from the   four cultural periods to date and compare with the more standard and numerous   radiocarbon dates from these same four periods.&nbsp; The OSL dating technique has   generally been applied to very sandy deposits.&nbsp; However, the OSL technicque here   provided very positive results that are quite similar to the numerous   radiocarbon ages obtained from the same cultural periods.&nbsp; Consequently, the   seldom used OSL technique on the fine-grained alluvial sediments appears   suitable for use even in these types of deposits.&nbsp; This provides yet another   dating technique that can be used to determine the ages of the deposits   surrounding the cultural artifacts in a alluvial   setting.</p>
        <p>Employing multiple techniques  toward   one general question/topic allows for a much stronger analysis of what   really happened in the past.&nbsp; For example, the identification of charred plant   parts (macrobotanical   analysis) did not directly correspond with the pollen results.&nbsp;   Here, if only one of these two techniques had been used, we would have ended with a   single result that  we believed represented the true nature of the   past environment.&nbsp; With the use of two techniques (macrobotanical and pollen analyses), with somewhat conflicting results, we now must soften our interpretations as to what the   past environment was really like.</p>
        <p>Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses also were   conducted on the same burned rocks as the lipid residue analysis.&nbsp; The isotopic   results definitely support the cooking of plants by the burned rocks through   very negative carbon isotope values.&nbsp; This cooking strategy apparently did not   change over the multiple events throughout time represented here.&nbsp; Again, the   use of multiple technical analyses have provided new insights and understanding   of the different food processing techniques.</p>
        <h3><strong>Looking to the  Future</strong></h3>
        <p>
      The combined  results from the various technical analyses at the Varga site have contributed detailed insights into human behavior and  ecology at the site.  &nbsp;It is hoped that  these and other technical analyses will be conducted at other excavated  sites.&nbsp; Continued use of diverse  technical analyses will add considerable information to the growing database of findings, enabling greater understanding and more broad-based interpretation of  prehistoric lifeways across Texas. It is also  hoped that researchers will develop more standardized methodologies for the  collection and analysis of samples, as well as report findings in such a way  as to allow for incorporation into shared research databases, such as the  Ceramics Database at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. By these  means, the findings from individual sites from a specific time period can be analyzed as groups to extract greater meaning and understanding at a higher level of human behavior.</p>
