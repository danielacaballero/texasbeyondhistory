    <td width="480" height="1142" valign="top"><p align="left">Some of La  Salle&rsquo;s contemporaries in Canada  referred to him as a wild dreamer, even as a mad man. Indeed, he was driven by  a great dream, a vision of magnificent achievement and high glory. In pursuit  of his dream, he perhaps displayed a touch of madness. He drove his men  unmercifully; when they deserted, he blamed his enemies. Three times&mdash;before the  final, fatal episode&mdash;there were attempts on his life, incited, he said, by the  jealousies of his rivals. He gave his ship captains impossible orders, then,  when a ship was wrecked, La Salle claimed that the captain had been seduced by his enemies, or was otherwise motivated by malice.  Assuredly, if the man was not mad, he was paranoid.<strong> </strong></p>
      <p align="left">The  influences that shaped his character, and his vision, though often elusive, had  their beginning in the wealthy merchant family into which he was born. La Salle&mdash;birth name  Robert Cavelier&mdash;was born in Rouen, the capital of old Normandy, on November 21,  1643, the second of three sons of Jean Cavelier<em> </em>and his wife, Catherine Gest. The older son, Jean (named for  his father), became a Sulpician priest and preceded Robert to Canada, where the French had established a  foothold optimistically called New France. By  La Salle&rsquo;s time, ships laden with furs from America  were ascending the Seine River to Rouen  in numbers. In the young Robert Cavelier, the scene surely inspired dreams of  one day crossing the ocean himself to conquer new territories to gain wealth  and honor. </p>
      <p align="left">After a  disappointing venture as a novice in the Jesuit priesthood, Robert left the  order and sailed for America.  By late summer 1667, he was at Ville-Marie, forerunner of Montreal,  described as &ldquo;perhaps the most dangerous place in Canada.&rdquo; La Salle&mdash;a name taken from  a family estate&mdash;made inroads  in the fur trade among the Indian tribes and carved from the wilderness a  colony called Saint-Sulpice. Yet his obsessive vision could not be suppressed.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;Having studied Indian languages, he learned  from a band of Iroquois Seneca of a distant  westward-running river called Ohio,  which no Frenchman had ever seen. La Salle sold his concession in 1669 and used  the proceeds to outfit his first exploratory journey, hoping to find a way to China by  following that river. This all-or-nothing gamble set the pattern for his life,  sacrificing the sure thing for a fantasy.</p>
      <p align="left">Whether La Salle made significant discoveries on that journey is  not known. From that time on, his record in Canada is marked by intense rivalry  and hostility among competing religious and commercial interests. With the  discovery by the Jolliet-Marquette expedition that the Mississippi River flowed  into the Gulf of Mexico and not the Pacific Ocean, La   Salle laid his plan. He must find a way into the Upper Great  Lakes, establish a string of outposts across the Illinois  country, then descend the Mississippi and  establish at its mouth a warm-water port for shipping furs when the Saint Lawrence River was frozen. </p>
      <p align="left">In pursuit  of this plan, La Salle&rsquo;s thirst for  discovery overruled his practical judgment. His vigor and determination antagonized  the various factions competing for the native fur trade, and they set out to destroy  him with  false rumors. His men, short of pay and often  driven to the limit of their endurance, were moved to desert; his creditors to  seize his assets; his brother to betray him; and the French Crown to  question his sanity. </p>

    <td width="480" valign="top"> <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Still, La  Salle made significant gains in Canada.  On a voyage to France in 1675, he obtained a royal grant to a post on the  north shore of Lake  Ontario. The new post, named Fort   Frontenac, was but a  stepping stone to his real ambition. He sailed again for France in 1677 to win a grant for the right to discover (at his own expense) &ldquo;the western  parts of New France; to establish forts  wherever he deems necessary&rdquo;; and to reap the commercial benefits.</p>
      <p align="left">Within a  few years, La Salle built a fort above Niagara Falls  and constructed the first sailing vessel (the <em>Griffon</em>) to ply the Upper Great Lakes.  The <em>Griffon</em> was a key element of his  plan; she would convey him to the lower end of Lake   Michigan. From there, by canoe and the necessary portages, he  would reach the Illinois River to build a fort and a new vessel for descending the Mississippi. Scarcely  begun, the plan began to unravel. The <em>Griffon</em>,  carrying a cargo of furs on which La Salle depended to pay his creditors, was  lost on the way back to Niagara. The second  vessel lay unfinished, as workers deserted. Forced to begin anew, La Salle,  with 23 Frenchmen and 31 Mohegan and Abnaki Indians, traveling by canoe,  descended the Illinois River to the Mississippi  and then turned southward to the Mississippi&rsquo;s  mouth. </p>
      <p align="left">On April 6  and 7, 1682, La Salle and his men explored  three of the river&rsquo;s eastern outlet channels. Two days later, on a spot of dry  land three leagues upstream, he planted the arms of France  and claimed for Louis XIV the entire Mississippi  drainage. Then began the long journey back up the river, hastened by a lack  of provisions and threatened by the hostile Qunipissa and Koroa Indians. La Salle himself fell violently ill along the way.</p>
      <p align="left">As time  would tell, the discovery had its confusing aspects. What he saw on the ground,  La Salle realized, did not fit the maps. The  discrepancies portended dire results for his effort to find the mouth of his  river from the sea. Eager as he was to return to France  to report his discovery, La Salle encountered  delays. He finally sailed for France,  arriving near the end of 1683 to seek support for his voyage to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
      <p align="left"> From the king of France, he received the grant of  the royal ship <em>Belle</em>, a light  frigate, with the 36-gun warship <em>Joly </em>assigned  as escort. At his own expense, La Salle leased the 180-ton cargo vessel <em>Aimable</em> to carry supplies, then added  the  <em>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois</em> to carry  supplies and trade goods as far as Saint-Domingue (Haiti).</p>
      <p align="left">With  France at war with Spain, La Salle's plan  was to establish a French base within striking distance of Spanish settlements and silver mines in Mexico. Some  maps of the period&mdash;all hypothetical&mdash;showed the Mississippi River,  or R&iacute;o del Esp&iacute;ritu Santo, discharging into the Gulf near the Texas coastal bend. Without means of taking  longitude, La Salle had been unable to  determine at what point on the east-west coast his river was found. The faulty  maps were his only clue. Thus, his voyage was doomed to failure at its  inception. </p>
      <p align="left">The four  ships sailed from La Rochelle, France, on July 24, 1684. Bad omens seemed to stalk the voyage from its inception. An  accident aboard <em>Le Joly</em> forced a  return to Rochefort for repairs, delaying final departure from France for another week. Dissension among the crew was followed by the loss of the <em>Saint-Fran&ccedil;ois</em> to Spanish raiders on the  approach to Saint-Domingue, then the defection of several men to a pirate fleet  at Petit Go&acirc;ve.&nbsp; Near Cuba&rsquo;s  western tip, a night-time squall caused the ships to drag anchor and crash  together in a mass of tangled rigging.&nbsp;&nbsp;  From that point, La Salle  set a course for the far end of the Gulf  of Mexico, where the maps indicated the mouth of the Mississippi would be found.  Navigation was precise but, on arrival there, La Salle  could see nothing he recognized. </p>
      <p align="left">After a  month of uncertainty, he began landing the people on Matagorda Island on the Texas coast.  Then came the series of misfortunes that ultimately spelled the ruin of his  enterprise. His supply ship, <em>Aimable</em>,  wrecked while trying to enter Matagorda Bay.  Still convinced that the Mississippi was near,  he sent the warship, <em>Joly</em>, back to France. With people  dying daily, La Salle put the survivors on a 50-mile  march up the bay to the site he had chosen on Garcitas Creek, which he called  <em>Rivi&egrave;re aux Boeufs</em> for the many buffalo. </p>
      <p align="left">Never  intended as a permanent settlement, this wilderness outpost, known in history  as &rdquo;Fort Saint Louis,&rdquo; was meant to be a temporary encampment until La Salle  found the main stem of the Mississippi. The means to accomplish his search was to have  been his last remaining ship, the little frigate <em>Belle</em>, which he loaded with supplies and weaponry for establishing  a post on his elusive river. Then the <em>Belle</em>,  too, was lost, running aground on a sandbar during a fierce storm. The people,  huddled in their crude camp on the Rivi&egrave;re aux Boeufs, were stranded. </p>
      <p align="left">La Salle  took seventeen men on an eastward march, hoping to find the Mississippi  and follow it to his Illinois post&mdash;the real  Fort Saint Louis&mdash;and to travel onward to Canada to seek relief for his  meager colony. Had the people waiting in their miserable settlement on the Texas coast received any  word at all from the marchers, they would have learned that their leader was  dead, the victim of a conspiracy among his disenchanted followers. </p>
      <p align="left">Although  his life was cut short, La Salle&rsquo;s vision and accomplishments were critical in  the shaping of North America. He explored the  Great Lakes region and Ohio and Mississippi valleys, &nbsp;blazing a trail to the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf  shore in 1682. &nbsp;In the name of France, he laid claim to this vast territory, equivalent  to roughly one-third of today&rsquo;s United    States, naming it <em>La Louisiane</em> in honor of the French monarch, Louis IV. In 1803, the  United States was to acquire  much of that land from France  in the <a href="images/lasalle-map-1.html" target="_blank">Louisiana Purchase</a>.</p>
