      <p><em>As the French were no longer on their guard, believing them</em> <em>{the Clamcoëhs, or Karankawa} to be friends, these had little trouble slaughtering them all, except the said Jean-Baptiste Talon; two of his brothers, younger than he, named Robert and Lucien; their older sister, named Marie-Magdalene; and another young Parisian named Eustache Bremen…They were saved by some women, who touched with compassion by their youth, loaded them on their backs and carried them into their cabins while their husbands massacred the rest, after the said Talons had seen their mother fall before their eyes. <br>
        <br>
        The aforementioned savage women also saved in the same way the wife of a French officer who commanded the settlement in the absence of Sr. de la Salle and who was also slain.  They were likewise moved with tenderness at the sight of the three-month-old baby she had at her breast, but the savages returned to their cabins after the massacre, killed her first and the her child, which on e of them dashed against a tree while holding by a foot. But they did not hurt the Talons or Eustache Breman, who were reared and loved by these same savage women who had saved them, as if they were their own children, for the six or seven years that they stayed among them…</em>.</p>
