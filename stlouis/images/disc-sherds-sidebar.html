      <p><strong>The Telltale Sherds</strong></p>
      <p>Archeologist Kathleen Gilmore found one puzzling,  unidentifiable group of green-glazed ceramic sherds in the materials recovered  from 1951 excavations at the Keeran Site. The earthenware weighed on her mind  in the years after she completed her analysis. As it developed, these sherds  were to provide the conclusive evidence for her that the Keeran Site was Fort St.    Louis. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;As Gilmore wrote in a  1986 article in the <em>Bulletin of Texas  Archeology</em>, the Keeran site collection included &ldquo;one group of French sherds  of a type that, to the best of the writer&rsquo;s knowledge, does not occur at any  other site in Texas.  The interiors are covered with a white slip over which a green glaze was  applied; this glaze varies from dull greenish yellow to deep grass green. The  lips on these sherds have been rolled onto the exterior, making them much  thicker than the bodies of the sherds.&nbsp;  The paste is buff to pink, with red specks. At the time of the original  analysis, this ware was thought probably to have been made in France.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Research carried out in both Canada  and France since that time  has shown definitely that the ware originated in Saintonge,  France, not far from La Rochelle, which was the center of colonial trade and  the port where La Salle embarked on his last  adventure.&nbsp; Unmistakable clues to this  origin are the paste, the glaze technique, and the rim treatment.&rdquo;</p>
