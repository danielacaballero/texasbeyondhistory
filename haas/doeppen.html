		          <p class="text">Investigations at the Doeppenschmidt-Haas house 
                    combined many lines of inquiry to date the structure and 
                    determine its period of use. Documentation of the structure, 
                    survey of the grounds, and test excavations within the house interior and two 
                    dump areas outside produced a quantity of artifacts and data. Perhaps most valuable, however, was having one of the former occupants, Fred 
                    Haas, as a &quot;co-investigator.&quot; Mr. Haas provided 
                    a colorful and poignant look back at the farmstead during 
                    its heyday and corrected the  
                    archeologists' interpretations of several enigmatic features.  His recollections 
                    are woven into the account of archeological findings.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Haas family moved to the log house shortly after 1901, the year Fred Haas was born. Although 
                    he was nearly 90 when he was interviewed for this project, 
                    his memory was sharp and his storytelling abilities unfettered 
                    by age. Although poor health prevented him from being at the 
                    site during archeological investigations, he returned for a celebration 
                    with his family and the current owners following the restoration of the house. 
                    On viewing the painstakingly rebuilt log structure, he exclaimed 
                    in typically forthright fashion, &quot;The house never looked 
                    this good!&quot;</p>
                  <h3>Life in a One-room House</h3>
            <p class="text">Although no recorded information was found pertaining to the builder 
              or date of construction of the log house, construction 
              techniques and certain artifacts suggest it was built sometime in 
              the 1870s. In contrast to the cruder, more hastily built log cabins 
              built by the earliest settlers of Texas, the Doeppenschmidt-Haas 
              house was well constructed and built for permanence, drawing on 
              building traditions developed in Europe and the upper southern United 
              States. The half-dovetail notching used is a construction type associated 
              with fine craftsmanship that, according to cultural geographer Terry 
              Jordan, suggests the hand of a knowledgeable workman rather than 
              a communal barn-raising effort by neighboring farmers. </p>
			  <p class="text">
			   The house is a roughly square, single-pen dwelling made of hand-hewn 
              cedar logs stacked horizontally, joined at corners with a combination 
              of half- and full-dovetail notching, and secured at the upper plate 
              with cedar pegs. Chinking between the logs was a mix of mud and 
              small stones, plastered over with a lime slurry. Haas recalls that 
              re-chinking had to be done by the family about every spring: &quot;The 
              holes between the logs would get so large you could throw a cat 
              through them.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">A front porch once extended across the front 
                    of the house, and it is shown in the circa 1915 photo of the 
                    house. It was there that family members slept on warm nights 
                    when the one-room house became too confining. It was there 
                    also that Haas believes one of the former residents was kept 
                    &quot;locked up.&quot; &quot;They claimed he'd lost his mind,&quot; 
                    he said. This recollection corresponds with census records 
                    for 1880 that list Phillip Doeppenschmidt as &quot;temporarily 
                    insane and paralyzed.&quot; Doeppenschmidt, who died in 1881, 
                    was buried at the hillside <a href="cemetery.html" class="text">cemetery</a> 
                    several miles from the house. </p>
            <p class="text">For Haas and his three brothers and sisters, life 
              in the one-room house was cramped but pleasant. Haas recalls his 
              mother cooking in an iron kettle in the large fireplace and heating 
              water there for family baths. Water was hauled from the creek several 
              hundred yards down the hill. In subsequent years, a shed room was 
              added for a kitchen at the rear of the house.</p>
            <p class="text">During his childhood, Haas wandered freely across 
              adjacent properties in the Hill Country. His mother allowed neighbors 
              to bring stock onto her property for water from the creek during 
              times of drought. Others from the area remember that cattle and 
              stock were branded and allowed to roam free among the large ranches. 
              As barb wire fencing became increasingly popular in Texas after 
              about 1880, the easily climbed dry-laid rock walls were gradually 
              replaced.</p>
            <h3>The Artifacts</h3>
                  <p class="text">Artifacts found during tests dug in the house 
                    interior bore out the varied activities that took place in 
                    the house. These ranged from toy parts and keepsakes to kitchenware 
                    and animal bone. A great many mementos were found in a test 
                    unit placed under the west window; among these were a German 
                    coin, a gold earring, a porcelain figurine, and a pocketknife&#151;all 
                    small enough to have slipped through cracks among the floor 
                    boards. The same may have been true for the many buttons recovered, 
                    fifteen of which were in front of the north doorway. Perhaps 
                    a pioneer woman sat there with her handwork and sewing to 
                    catch the breeze and natural light. Haas recalls, however, 
                    that as a child he dropped coins and buttons through the floorboards. 
                  </p>
            <p class="text">Fragments of stoneware and glass storage containers 
              as well as bottles of patent medicine, snuff, and beverages were 
              found in test excavations in the house and in the two dump areas 
              outside the rock-walled yard. From the 1880s and later, these items 
              could be purchased at stores in Bee Caves, Cedar Valley, and Austin. 
              Haas recalls walking several miles to Cedar Valley to buy snuff 
              for his mother. He also recalls visits to <a href="clerk.html" class="text">Hallman's 
              store</a> several miles away.</p>
            <p class="text">For larger purchases, the family periodically travelled 
              to Austin. The trip was a day-long process by wagon or on horseback 
              along Bee Cave Road, a rocky and rutted dirt lane so narrow that 
              cedar branches brushed the wagons. The road was not paved until 
              1936. Travelers crossed the Colorado River by ferry or, by 1890, 
              bridges over Barton Creek and the Colorado River. </p>
                  <p class="text">Some of the artifacts&#151;a brass luggage tag, 
                    the German coin, ornate black glass buttons, beads, the earring, 
                    and fragments of decorative bric-a-brac&#151;are more unusual 
                    items, particularly when considered in the context of the 
                    rugged frontier lifestyle epitomized at the site. Several 
                    appear to be the keepsakes of fairly worldly individuals who 
                    had traveled in a large city. Such a profile might fit an 
                    immigrant family&#151;either Doeppenschmidt or Haas&#151;who 
                    had retained mementos of a land and lifestyle left behind.</p>
            <p class="text">Artifacts were analyzed both for clues for dating 
              the site as well as for information about the families themselves. 
              One interesting piece of information that emerged from the study 
              was the similarity of tableware and glassware used by folks in rural 
              areas and in the city of Austin during the roughly fifty-year time 
              period from 1880 to 1930. Vessels of plain white ironstone, or whiteware, 
              predominated until a wide array of colorful decorated styles came 
              into vogue in the early 1900s. That rural folk living on what were 
              essentially &quot;frontier&quot; farmsteads would share the same 
              style preferences with city dwellers and be part of a larger network 
              of commerce is testament, perhaps, to the far-reaching effects of 
              mail order catalogs. </p>
            <h3>Afterward</h3>
            <p class="text">Although the house lacked such amenities as electricity, 
              indoor plumbing, or a well, it was occupied into the late 1930s 
              by families with as many as four children. At that point, the land 
              was purchased as part of a larger acquisition by the current landowners 
              who determined to restore the log house and protect the other historic 
              sites nearby. With Austin architect Joe Freeman overseeing renovations, 
              the house was brought back from ruin. The yard was cleared and landscaped 
              using native plants and the rock wall surrounding the house carefully 
              re-laid. Today the house, looking much as it did when first completed 
              by the careful craftsman over a century ago, is used as a family 
              retreat.</p>
