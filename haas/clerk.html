		    <p class="text">In 1882, prominent Austin businessman Ernst Hallman 
              determined to make a dramatic change in his life. Ten years previously, 
              the native of Colberg, Prussia, had been terribly injured in a train 
              accident in Manor, Texas. As a result, both his left leg and right 
              foot had to be amputated. Although he continued working as a district 
              clerk for Travis County for several years afterward, he apparently 
              was ready to leave city life behind. Having purchased more than 
              2400 acres of raw land west of the city, Hallman and his wife, Johanna 
              Schenck Hallman moved to the Hill Country to raise sheep.</p>
            <p class="text">Little is known of the outcome of his venture. For 
              even the toughest and most able bodied of men, the tasks of establishing 
              a ranching operation must have been daunting. Even today, the rocky 
              roads traversing the property Hallman once owned are rough and, 
              during bad weather, treacherous. And yet postal records tell us 
              that from 1883 to 1885, he also served as the postmaster of the 
              community of Colberg in the &quot;Hays/Travis area.&quot; Did the 
              native of Colberg, Prussia, give this small enclave the name of 
              his birthplace?</p>
<p class="text">Today, all that is left on the land he once owned 
              is a well-constructed stone building on a high ridge overlooking 
              a tree-lined hollow. The 16-x-35-foot building is coursed masonry: 
              hand-cut limestone laid with a mortar of burned lime and sand. The 
              interior is dirt-floored and one-room wide, although a frame partition 
              divides the interior into two sections. </p>
            <p class="text">In the fields surrounding the building, patterns of 
              rock are aligned in large rectangular patterns, perhaps the remnants 
              of corrals or pens. Piles of cut wood, nails, and other building 
              materials indicate that other structures, some say bunkhouses, once 
              stood in the area as well.</p>
                  <p class="text">Based on the artifacts, the stone structure 
                    and outbuildings were used chiefly as a residence and for 
                    farm or ranch purposes. As a group, the artifacts date the 
                    site from the 1870s to the early 1900s: fragments of heavy 
                    white tableware popular in the 1880s and 1890s, sherds of 
                    stoneware crocks and churns; bits of bitters, Schnapps and 
                    beer bottles from the 1870s to early twentieth century. Parts 
                    of a cast iron stove, horseshoes, a metal pail, baling wire, 
                    and other objects were found in the adjacent fields. </p>
                  <p class="text">Yet, ranchers in the area today clearly recall 
                    their grandparents' stories describing the stone building 
                    not only as a store but also as containing wooden post office 
                    boxes, a combination of services typical in rural communities. 
                    Small country stores chiefly carried basic items required 
                    for everyday life such as flour, sugar, coffee, and salt as 
                    well as a limited supply of dry goods and such non-staple 
                    items as snuff, bitters, medicine, liquor, and candy. The 
                    storeowner and his family often lived in one end of the store 
                    partitioned off from the commercial side. Because the objects 
                    sold in the store were intended largely for household use, 
                    they would be largely indistinguishable from artifacts found 
                    in a rural dwelling. For archeologists sorting through these 
                    remains, the problem of the building's function was frustrating, 
                    and is, as yet, not fully resolved.</p>
                  <p class="text">Whatever his role&#151;rancher, storekeeper, 
                    postal clerk, or all three&#151;Hallman remained at the scenic 
                    hilltop compound for only a decade, moving back to Austin 
                    with his family shortly before his death in 1892. His widow 
                    and two daughters retained ownership of the property until 
                    1907. Today, the small hollow at the base of the hill still 
                    carries his name, although the spelling has changed over time.</p>
