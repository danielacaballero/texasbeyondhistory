                  <p class="text">In the hilly uplands of Barton Creek, low rock 
                    enclosures and an ornate wrought iron fence stand out in odd 
                    relief amid an otherwise stark landscape. Yucca, scrub oak, 
                    and native grasses have overtaken this small cemetery, moving 
                    in and taking hold where cattle and goats have nudged the 
                    stone walls over. </p>
                  <p class="text">At times in the past, this somewhat desolate 
                    place saw family members gather to bury a loved one, bringing 
                    the coffin on horse-drawn wagon over rocky roads. Nine-year 
                    old Birdie Rose was laid to rest here in 1879 by her family&#151; 
                    Swedish immigrant Charles Rose, who served as postmaster in 
                    Cedar Valley, mother Rebecca, a native of Arkansas, and four 
                    brothers and sisters. Nearby is the grave of the ill-fated 
                    Phillip Doeppenschmidt, who according to local lore, was kept 
                    locked up on the front porch of his family's loghouse. Census 
                    records for 1880 list him as insane and an invalid; he died 
                    a year later at the age of 61. Missouri native Issac Hale 
                    came to the Texas Hill Country to farm the land, but died 
                    at the age of 30 leaving behind a wife and two small sons. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Fred Haas, who grew up in a nearby log house, 
                    recalls that a funeral in the Hill Country around the turn 
                    of the twentieth century might, at best, involve a circuit-riding 
                    preacher. There were, of course, no funeral homes, and bodies 
                    were generally laid out on a table at home prior to burial.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although perhaps as many as 30 other individuals 
                    were buried in this small cemetery, their identities and stories 
                    have been lost or forgotten. The few existing gravestones, 
                    including those for the three accounted for above, have weathered 
                    now almost beyond recognition. There may have been wooden 
                    markers in the past, but these, too, have vanished. But in 
                    the cemetery itself&#151;in its layout and general plan&#151;we 
                    can see traces of the people who were once here, a microcosm 
                    of the traditions and cultures brought into the Hill Country. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The single decorative wrought-iron enclosure 
                    is distinctly German in style; similar grave fences can be 
                    seen in early communities such as Fredericksburg. But unlike 
                    German cemeteries, with their more rigid organization and 
                    family hierarchy (children were buried in a children's section 
                    apart from the parents), there is little patterning in the 
                    graves in this hillside cemetery. More likely, it evolved 
                    over a brief period of time as families of several different 
                    backgrounds came together in a community effort. </p>
                  <p class="text">There are low walls of stone&#151;some carefully 
                    cut, others unshaped&#151;enclosing what clearly are multiple 
                    graves. A few of the larger may contain as many as five or 
                    six graves, and these may be family plots. There is no evidence 
                    that these were capped with a stone slab, as were similar 
                    graves in other communities of the period. Although legend 
                    claims the walls were erected to keep Indians and wild animals 
                    from disturbing the graves, the more likely explanation is 
                    that they were built to keep out grazing animals. </p>
                  <p class="text">Cemeteries springing from the southern traditions 
                    have been described by cultural geographer Terry Jordan as 
                    &quot;a mixture of order and chaos.&quot; The single measure 
                    of order in these cemeteries, he tells us, is an unfailing 
                    orientation of the graves to an east-west axis; a design anticipating 
                    Judgement Day, when the dead might rise facing Christ, as 
                    symbolically represented by the sun. In spite of the lack 
                    of markers and the deterioration of many of the enclosures, 
                    the orientation of the graves in this small Barton Creek cemetery 
                    is quite clear.</p>
