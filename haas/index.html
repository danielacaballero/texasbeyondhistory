                  <p class="text">The old log house had been well lived in by 
                    more than four generations of families, some of the first 
                    settlers to venture into the hills west of Austin. But after 
                    roughly 100 years of standing up to hard use and the elements, 
                    it had fallen into ruin, its roof caved in, walls sagging, 
                    and floor rotted out. It was a fairly common sight in the 
                    Texas Hill Country, where traces of our pioneer past&#151;fences, 
                    stone walls, houses, and farmsteads&#151;now go largely unnoticed 
                    and, eventually, fall to ruin, the victims of natural processes 
                    or, more commonly now, bulldozers and development. </p>
                  <p class="text">But this particular house was to be spared, 
                    the landowners intrigued by local stories about its history 
                    and moved by a feeling of responsibility to preserve the heritage 
                    of their land. When they set out to restore it, they did not 
                    merely hire a carpenter but rather a team of specialists to 
                    uncover its history and rebuild it accordingly: archeologists 
                    from the University of Texas at Austin, an architect specializing 
                    in historic structures, even a landscape restorationist. It 
                    was through the efforts of this group that the Doeppenschmidt-Haas 
                    house was brought back to life, the story of a young boy raised 
                    in the house at the turn of the twentieth century was heard, 
                    and the traces of a small pioneer community in the hills west 
                    of Austin were drawn together.</p>
                  <p class="text">The stories embodied in the now-abandoned farmsteads 
                    and structures are of a people whose everyday lives, by modern 
                    standards, are heroic. The study of these families and the 
                    loosely connected settlement along Barton Creek provides a 
                    record of a little-appreciated time in Texas history. At the 
                    turn of the twentieth century, sweeping changes occurred in 
                    Texas cities with the advent of electricity, communications 
                    systems, and better transportation. In many of the rural areas, 
                    however, time was frozen. Families grew and canned much of 
                    their own food, cooked in fireplaces and wood-burning stoves, 
                    and hauled water for drinking and laundry. Homes were lit 
                    by kerosene and Aladdin lamps. Children attended school periodically, 
                    depending on crop planting and harvest times, and went to 
                    poorly funded institutions referred to as the &quot;mountain 
                    schools.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">As a rule, life continued to revolve around 
                    the seasons and the land and the vagaries of nature. Modernization 
                    came relatively late to the hill country, and even then, changes 
                    were gradual. Well into the 1930s and 1940s, some families 
                    continued living what was, in essence, a pioneer existence. 
                  </p>

" class="thumbimg"></a></div>
                  <div class="caption">Archeologists from UT Austin survey rocky 
                    hillslopes surrounding a historic site to determine its perimeters 
                    and to recover any artifacts that might help establish its 
                    age. </div>
                  <p class="text">When archeologists from TARL at UT Austin began 
                    to survey the area, the landowners had already identified 
                    several historic sites. There was the log house that once 
                    belonged to the Haas family and, several miles away, a picturesque 
                    stone building thought by some to have been a country store. 
                    Still more remote was a small cemetery, its few remaining 
                    markers toppled, the walls around the graves reduced, in some 
                    cases, to piles of rubble. There were other historic-era sites 
                    scattered across the property: remnants of stone foundations, 
                    a log crib, a hand-dug well, scatters of purpled glass and 
                    rusted metal. The task at hand was to gather and analyze evidence 
                    from each site, interview neighbors and other informants, 
                    and investigate early records to try to learn more about the 
                    families who once had lived there and who, for the most part, 
                    had vanished. <br>
                    <br>
                    Bringing the pieces of the puzzle together depended heavily 
                    on deed and court records and recollections of area residents: 
                    When was the area first settled? Who were the settlers and 
                    why did they take on what must have been, at best, a hard-scrabble 
                    existence on the land? Were the families that lived on the 
                    sites related&#151;or were the sites even in use at the same 
                    time? Other information was derived from the physical evidence 
                    itself&#151;the building remains and artifacts left behind 
                    by the former occupants.</p>
                  <h3>Settlement West of Austin</h3>
                  <p class="text">On a larger scale, the hilly area west of Austin 
                    appears to have been settled predominately in the latter quarter 
                    of the nineteenth century, when threats of Indian incursions 
                    had abated. Deed records indicated that although tracts of 
                    land were patented as early as the 1850s, most were left in 
                    a natural state and used as reliable sources of fence posts 
                    and firewood. Within the upper Barton Creek region, archeologists 
                    found that the earliest sites were situated close to a permanent 
                    water supply and fertile valley land. By the turn of the century, 
                    as machine-drilled wells and wire fencing became available, 
                    additional farmsteads were established in upland areas. This 
                    movement also indicated a change in livelihood from small-scale 
                    subsistence farming to larger stock-raising operations requiring 
                    upland grazing areas and more acreage for crops.</p>
                  <p class="text"> One way of understanding a cultural landscape 
                    is through its architectural elements: remnants of physical 
                    structures and fences retain the imprint of the builders and 
                    sometimes can reveal aspects of their origins. In the area 
                    west of Austin, early European American settlers left distinctive 
                    marks on the land. Their diverse cultural backgrounds are 
                    signaled in the fine examples of folk architecture, the varied 
                    complex of stone and log fences, the remains of upland farmsteads, 
                    and the mortuary traditions reflected in the small cemeteries. 
                    In the sections below, we look at several of the more interesting 
                    examples. </p>
