                  <p class="text">Investigators faced a complicated problem in 
                    interpreting the deep deposits of sediment representing thousands 
                    of years of natural deposition and human activities in Kincaid 
                    Shelter. More than 10 feet (3 m) in depth, the excavated deposits 
                    spanned Late Pleistocene to recent times and represented different 
                    types of sediment accumulation, ranging from wind-blown dust 
                    and floodwater silt to ash, charcoal and rocks from campfires. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In the deeper, older zones, the excavators encountered 
                    layers of pond clay and spring-deposited travertine&#151;reminders 
                    of the wet conditions in the cave which prompted early inhabitants 
                    to construct a rock pavement over the muddy floor. The spring, 
                    which emanated at the back of the shelter, apparently ceased 
                    to run after early Paleoindian times (after the deposition 
                    of Zone 4). </p>
                  <p class="text">Within the deposits investigators found animal 
                    bones from both extinct and modern species and a variety of 
                    items left behind by countless generations of human occupants 
                    at the shelter. Among the artifacts were projectile points 
                    and other diagnostic stone tools representing almost all intervals 
                    of the Central Texas archeological sequence.</p>
                  <p class="text"> There was not, however, a clear stratigraphic 
                    ordering of diagnostic types, the time-sensitive artifacts 
                    that could be compared to those recovered from other, better 
                    dated sites. Erosion and human disturbances (both ancient 
                    and more recent) had disrupted the Kincaid deposits, mixing 
                    together many of the artifacts. More than half the artifacts 
                    recovered from Kincaid were found in the treasure-hunters' 
                    backdirt piles. </p>
                  <p class="text">Several hearths (warming or cooking features) 
                    also were found in Zones 5 and 6, but these were not fully 
                    documented. Although there were no burials found within the 
                    shelter, investigators recovered some 60 human bones scattered 
                    within the two upper zones, representing at least four individuals. 
                    These skeletal remains were probably from burials that were 
                    disturbed by animals or later occupants of the shelter. </p>
                  <p class="text">The walls of the deep trench in the center of 
                    the shelter provided a stratigraphic &quot;profile&quot; that 
                    helped geologists Glen Evans and E. H. Sellards classify the 
                    deposits into the various zones (stratigraphic units). These 
                    are described below, beginning with the oldest unit, Zone 
                    1, and include a detailed look at the rock pavement constructed 
                    over Zone 3. </p>
                  <h3>Early Non-Cultural Zones </h3>
                  <p class="text"><b>Zone 1.</b> Zone 1 is the lowermost unit 
                    of the shelter fill encountered during the excavations. The 
                    full thickness of this zone was penetrated only in the back 
                    and west parts of the shelter, where it was thinned out against 
                    the sloping limestone walls. One excavation square at the 
                    front edge of the shelter was dug to a depth of 14 feet (4.2 
                    m) below the surface and penetrated 5 feet, 7 inches (1.7 
                    m) into Zone 1 without reaching bedrock. </p>
                  <p><span class="text">Zone 1 consisted of a buff-colored, floodplain 
                    silt with a few stringers (thin layers) of small, rounded 
                    limestone pebbles. Numerous spalls and blocks of limestone 
                    from the shelter walls and ceiling occurred at the base and 
                    back margin of the zone. No cultural materials or fossil animal 
                    bones were found in Zone 1.</span></p>
                  <p><span class="text"><b>Zone 2.</b> This zone was a silty, 
                    river-laid deposit up to nearly 4 feet (1.2 m) in thickness. 
                    It was entirely truncated (cut out) by water erosion immediately 
                    in front of the shelter. No cultural materials were found 
                    in Zone 2, but one identifiable fossil, a partial jaw with 
                    three teeth, belonging to an extinct species of horse, <em>Equus 
                    sp.</em>, was found in the middle part of the deposit. This 
                    zone can be assigned to the Wisconsin stage of the Pleistocene. 
                    (The Wisconsin stage was the last major glaciation period 
                    in North America, roughly 75,000 to 12,000 years ago.)</span></p>
                  <h3>A Late-Pleistocene Menagerie</h3>
                  <p class="text"><b>Zone 3. </b>During the time represented in 
                    Zone 3, a small, spring-fed pond filled a low area in the 
                    center of the shelter. The bones of many types of animals&#151;perhaps 
                    the dinner leavings of a large carnivore such as a cave lion&#151;began 
                    to accumulate nearby. There is some, albeit scant, evidence 
                    of human occupation of the shelter during this time.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Zone 3 consisted of a ponded clay deposit containing 
                    layers of clay and fine silty clay resulting from deposition 
                    in the placid pond with intermittent episodes of flooding. 
                    The clay deposit reached a maximum thickness of 1.5 feet (46 
                    cm) thick and occupied a shallow central depression apparently 
                    formed by high flood waters of the Sabinal River washing into 
                    the shelter. A travertine deposit (calcareous limestone formed 
                    by mineral-laden water) in the back wall extended into the 
                    clay. This deposit indicates that the pond was fed by seep 
                    springs. In the front part of the shelter, the clay deposit 
                    (Zone 3), as well as Zone 2, had been completely removed by 
                    erosion.</p>
                  <p class="text">Except in the front eroded area, Zone 3 was 
                    capped by an ancient, man-made rock pavement which lay between 
                    Zones 3 and 4. Additional small patches of cobblestone pavement 
                    covering an estimated total area of 30 to 40 square feet (2.8 
                    to 3.7 square meters) occurred in the middle portion of the 
                    zone, and were overlain by stream-deposited seams of silt 
                    and clay, which in turn, were overlain by the larger rock 
                    pavement. These intra-zonal patches of pavement will be further 
                    discussed below in a separate section dealing with the rock 
                    floor pavement.</p>
                  <p class="text">Fossil bones and teeth representing several 
                    extinct vertebrate species occurred in Zone 3, including horse, 
                    mammoth, large cat, ground sloth, camel, bison, wolf, antelope, 
                    raccoon, alligator, and two genera of aquatic turtles. Although 
                    most of the bones were badly broken and decomposed, a number 
                    of teeth, along with some jaws and other hard skeletal parts, 
                    were found in good condition. The advanced stage of decomposition 
                    seen in most of the bones suggests that they were exposed 
                    at the surface for a considerable period of time before being 
                    buried by the sediment. Quite possibly the bones were broken 
                    by man or by carnivorous animals. The most important elements 
                    that have been recognized from the fauna of Zone 3 are listed 
                    below.</p>
                  <p class="text">The extinct great American lion (also known 
                    as cave lion), <em>Panthera atrox</em>, is represented by a 
                    canine tooth. Some badly decomposed foot bones of another 
                    species of <em>Panthera</em>, possibly P. <em>onca</em>, the jaguar, 
                    also were found imbedded in the clay of Zone 3, A ground sloth, 
                    <em>Paramylodon</em>, is represented by a broken tooth, jaw 
                    fragment, and part of one vertebra. Camel, <em>Camelops sp.</em>, 
                    is represented by a jaw with cheek teeth of an immature individual, 
                    and by several other broken bones and teeth. Other mammals, 
                    represented by teeth and identifiable limb bones, include 
                    bison, a large wolf, antelope, and raccoon.</p>
                  <p class="text">Alligator is represented by a series of articulated 
                    vertebrae and some scutes and broken limb bones. Bones of 
                    two genera of aquatic turtles, identified as <em>Trionyx sp.</em> 
                    and <em>Pseudemys sp.</em>, also were found in Zone 3. The presence 
                    of alligator and aquatic turtles indicates a source of permanent 
                    water in the near vicinity, the ancient Sabinal River.</p>
                  <p class="text">Several small patches of cobblestone pavement 
                    apparently were found at a level below the main rock floor 
                    pavement, and Evans thought these might be evidence of human 
                    activity in Zone 3. Three thin flint flakes and a fourth thicker 
                    flake with a chipped edge also were found in this zone, but 
                    these items likely were introduced into Zone 3 during the 
                    construction of the main rock pavement.</p>
                  <p class="text">Evans also considered the numerous animal bones 
                    in Zone 3 as possible evidence of human hunters. Vertebrate 
                    paleontologist Melissa Winans, who analyzed the Kincaid fauna, 
                    thought a more likely explanation was that animal predators 
                    denned in the shelter were responsible for the bone accumulation. 
                    None of the bones bear either identifiable butchering marks 
                    or carnivore tooth marks; however, most of the bones have 
                    undergone extensive weathering which could have erased any 
                    identifying marks that may originally have been present.</p>

                  <p class="text">A remarkable feature that occurred in the older 
                    part of the shelter fill was a man-made rock pavement that 
                    rested on the surface of Zone 3 clay and was overlain by travertine, 
                    clay, and limestone grit (Zone 4). The front area of this 
                    pavement was partially destroyed by stream erosion from high-level 
                    flooding of the ancient Sabinal River before deposition of 
                    Zone 4 sediments; and two sections of the pavement had been 
                    destroyed by the old treasure-hunter diggings made prior to 
                    the 1948 excavation. </p>
                  <p class="text">Fortunately, substantial parts of the pavement 
                    were still intact, including one large segment covering more 
                    than 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) in the northeastern 
                    part of the shelter. In the front part of the shelter, where 
                    stream erosion cut out part of the underlying Zone 3 clay, 
                    the heaviest pavement stones were let down on the old erosion 
                    surface. Smaller pavement stones undoubtedly were washed away 
                    by the flood current. The shelter floor plan (below, left) 
                    shows the undisturbed area and the eroded area of the pavement 
                    as found in 1948. The stratigraphic position and form of the 
                    pavement is best shown in longitudinal and cross section profiles.</p>
                  <p class="text">The pavement stones were well-rounded, partially 
                    rounded, and angular boulders most of which range from 8 to 
                    14 inches (20 to 36 cm) in maximum diameter. These stones 
                    were Cretaceous (chiefly Edwards) limestone and flint, and<b> 
                    are not from the Anacacho Formation</b> in which the shelter 
                    resides. The smallest boulders still in place were 4 to 5 
                    inches (10 to 13 cm) in diameter. The largest pavement stone 
                    was 32 inches (81 cm) in maximum diameter and weighed approximately 
                    70 pounds (31.8 kilograms). </p>
                  <p class="text">A large number of the stones were placed with 
                    flat or sharply angular sides down, and with the dome or rounded 
                    sides upward. The boulders were fitted closely together in 
                    a manner similar to that used in modern stone patios. Cracks 
                    between the larger boulders were filled with small, angular 
                    limestone fragments and some rounded stream pebbles. This 
                    chinking of the larger cracks in the pavement was done deliberately, 
                    as the manner and level of in filling was similar in all parts 
                    of the uneroded pavement. </p>
                  <p class="text">Features on the surface of Zone 3 clay beneath 
                    the pavement show clearly that the stones were emplaced while 
                    the clay was still in the form of wet mud. The larger stones 
                    sank into the mud, forming prominent depressions, and peaks. 
                    The mud squeezed upward, in some cases several inches, into 
                    the spaces between the boulders. Bones of alligator, elephant, 
                    and horse, which also were found in both overlying and underlying 
                    deposits, were found wedged and crushed between some of the 
                    pavement stones.</p>
                  <p class="text">Some of the stones used in the pavement show 
                    the characteristic rounding produced by stream-bed erosion. 
                    Some of the larger limestone boulders exhibit weathering features 
                    characteristic of boulders that have lain for a long time 
                    partially buried in soil. Most of the pavement stones are 
                    derived from formations which do not crop out in the vicinity 
                    but are known to crop out upstream along the Sabinal River. 
                    Similar stream-transported boulders occur commonly in the 
                    riverbed near the shelter at the present time.</p>
                  <p class="text">The constructional arrangement of the pavement 
                    stones, and the fact that most of them could not have originated 
                    within the shelter and could not have been transported and 
                    deposited by any natural agency, precludes any viable explanation 
                    other than that the pavement was made by deliberate human 
                    effort. The preserved portion of the pavement covers only 
                    that part of the shelter floor containing the underlying pond 
                    clay deposits of Zone 3. It seems evident that the purpose 
                    of the pavement was to cover the muddy portion of the shelter 
                    floor in order to make it more habitable. </p>
                  <p class="text">The previously mentioned patches of somewhat 
                    older, intra-zonal cobblestone pavement differ from the rock 
                    floor pavement in several ways: the individual stones are 
                    considerably smaller, more loosely fitted together and have 
                    little or no chinking in the spaces between the cobbles. Flood 
                    waters washed through the shelter at different times, and 
                    this kind of erosion could account for the loosely fitted 
                    nature of the cobbles&#151;but not for the transport or arrangement 
                    of the small pavement patches. These pavement sections appeared 
                    to be in substantially their original location; however, there 
                    is no indication that they are segments of the larger pavement 
                    that were isolated by stream erosion. </p>
                  <p class="text">The apparent purpose for making the pavement 
                    patches was to cover muddy spots on the shelter floor. There 
                    is no reason to believe that the cobblestone patches are very 
                    much older than the larger and more substantial rock floor 
                    pavement, as they are separated by sediment only a few inches 
                    thick. It seems entirely possible that the same people made 
                    both pavements.</p>
                  <p class="text">Bones of extinct species of vertebrates found 
                    in sediments immediately below and above the pavement indicate 
                    that the pavement was made in Late Pleistocene times by Paleoindian 
                    people who quite possibly had hunted the animals for food 
                    and for other uses. Artifacts found at higher levels in Zone 
                    4 are thought to belong to the occupants who made the pavement.</p>
                   <h3>Clovis Toolmaking</h3> 
                  <p class="text"><b>Zone 4. </b>This zone holds the major Pleistocene-age 
                    cultural deposit in Kincaid Shelter&#151;a Clovis stone tool 
                    &quot;workshop&quot; and habitation area. Zone 4 rests directly 
                    on and covers most of the stone pavement. Geologically, the 
                    deposit consists of three <em>facies</em>, or stratigraphic 
                    features&#151;travertine near the back wall of the shelter, 
                    ponded clay with particles of limestone grit in the central 
                    part of the shelter, and primarily grit in a sparse clayey 
                    matrix near the front of the shelter. The &quot;grit&quot; 
                    in the two forward facies is small angular to sub-angular 
                    pieces of limestone. Zone 4 deposits apparently resulted from 
                    ponding of seep spring water issuing from the back wall of 
                    the shelter and the action of moderately swift Sabinal River 
                    flood waters encroaching through the front of the shelter.</p>
                  <p class="text">The upper surface of Zone 4 is an erosional 
                    disconformity which, in places, completely removed Zone 4 
                    and exposed the stone pavement. This disconformity marks the 
                    break between the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits (Zones 
                    5 and 6) in the shelter and, as such, is the most significant 
                    stratigraphic boundary in the shelter fill. It separated underlying 
                    deposits containing ancient cultural materials and bones of 
                    extinct animals from overlying deposits containing later cultural 
                    materials and bones of modern animals. The erosion was deepest 
                    in the front part, where it completely cut out Zone 3 and 
                    displaced the rock floor pavement.</p>
                  <p class="text">The travertine&#151;a hard, calcium carbonate 
                    deposit formed by seep springs&#151;occurred as an irregular 
                    sheet, 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) thick, that extended down 
                    the back wall and 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) outward into 
                    the shelter. The clay deposit averaged only 3 to 4 inches 
                    (8 to 10 cm), and the grit deposit had a maximum thickness 
                    of 24 inches (61 cm).</p>
                  <p class="text">Animal bones and teeth, generally in a poor 
                    state of preservation, were present in Zone 4 and include 
                    extinct taxa of bison, horse, mammoth, and ground sloth. Other 
                    animal remains included alligator, turtle, badger, racoon, 
                    and antelope, all of which occur in or near the area today. 
                    The advanced state of decomposition indicates a very slow 
                    rate of deposition for Zone 4 sediments. The bones evidently 
                    were subjected to surface weathering for a long time before 
                    being completely buried by the deposits. </p>
                  <p class="text">The best preserved fossils of Zone 4 were found 
                    embedded in the hard travertine in the back part of the shelter. 
                    A few bones of a large extinct bison (<em>Bison antiquus</em>) 
                    were found on the upper contact of Zone 4, and probably were 
                    exposed by the erosion that preceded deposition of Zone 5. 
                    The articulated condition of some of the fossils, including 
                    the bison and several alligator vertebrae, rules out the possibility 
                    that they could have been derived from older deposits.</p>
                  <p class="text">The stone tools and tool-making debris found 
                    in Zone 4 bear distinctive Clovis attributes, according to 
                    archeologist Mike Collins who has analyzed this assemblage 
                    (see <b>Kincaid Revisited </b>section for more detail). Several 
                    flakes, four biface preforms broken during manufacture, the 
                    basal fragment of an obsidian projectile point, modified flakes, 
                    three cores, and a polyhedral blade core were found on the 
                    stone pavement and in Zone 4. A fluted preform was found on 
                    the contact between Zones 4 and 5 and refits with one of the 
                    biface preforms noted above. In addition, a small, reworked 
                    Clovis point found in the treasure-hunters' backdirt is attributable 
                    to Zone 4 on the basis of adhering travertine. Evans noted 
                    that the obsidian point was associated with the fossil bison 
                    bone. </p>
                  <p class="text">On the basis of faunal evidence, Zone 4 can 
                    be assigned to the Wisconsin Stage of the Late Pleistocene, 
                    and the presence of <em>Bison antiquus</em> indicates a late 
                    substage rather than an earlier part of the Wisconsin. It 
                    is perhaps significant that the size of the bison bones from 
                    Zone 4 compares quite closely with those of larger individuals 
                    from the bone beds containing Folsom points at the Lubbock 
                    Lake Site of northwestern Texas and the Blackwater Site No. 
                    1 of the Clovis-Portales area in eastern New Mexico. </p> 
                  <p class="text">Except for differences which can be accounted 
                    for by accidents of preservation, there seem to have been 
                    no important changes in the fauna from Zone 3 and Zone 4. 
                    Moreover, the sediments comprising Zone 4 were in some respects 
                    very similar to those of Zone 3. This indicates that depositional 
                    conditions within the shelter during Zone 3 time continued 
                    into the period represented by Zone 4.</p>

                          adhering to the tip. Perhaps a Clovis hunter discarded 
                          the spent projectile point near the seep spring at the 
                          back of the shelter, where it became coated with the 
                          hard, calcium carbonate substance. </div>

                  <p class="text"><b>Zone 5.</b> Zone 5 within the shelter interior 
                    was a silty, midden-rich deposit containing remains of Holocene 
                    fauna and cultural materials diagnostic of the Archaic period. 
                    In places, Zone 5 was up to 42 inches (1.1 m) thick, and consisted 
                    mainly of fine-grained, calcareous silt. Small irregular masses 
                    of travertine occurred in the zone at and near the back wall 
                    of the shelter. </p>
                  <p class="text">The lack of ponded clay and diminished presence 
                    of travertine indicates that the spring at the back of the 
                    shelter had ceased to flow prior to deposition of Zone 5; 
                    in fact, no travertine caps the surface of Zone 4, further 
                    indicating that the spring did not flow during the interim 
                    between the end of Zone 4 and beginning of Zone 5 accumulation. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Zone 5 is separated from the underlying older 
                    fill, both within and outside the shelter, by a distinct erosional 
                    surface, except in limited areas where it is in direct contact 
                    with the stone pavement. The contact with the overlying Zone 
                    6 is well-defined only in a relatively small area near the 
                    back of the shelter. Elsewhere the division between Zones 
                    5 and 6 is based partly on differences in compaction and color 
                    of the sediments, and partly on the basis of relative abundance 
                    of cultural materials. The fauna of both Zone 5 and Zone 6 
                    are modern species. </p>
                  <p class="text">A few non-diagnostic specimens with Zone 4 matrix 
                    adhering to them as well as a fragmentary Clovis preform that 
                    refits with a fragment found in place in Zone 4 were found 
                    in the lower few centimeters of Zone 5. This suggests that 
                    some blurring of the boundary between Zones 4 and 5 resulted 
                    from the erosion of the surface of Zone 4 and the nature of 
                    the initial deposition of Zone 5. The proveniences of diagnostic 
                    artifacts within Zone 5 do not record a clear stratigraphic 
                    ordering, but dart point types representative of the early, 
                    middle, and late Archaic periods are present. There, are also 
                    various adzes, scrapers, cores, bifaces, engraved stones, 
                    and other artifacts.</p>
                  <p class="text">As shown in the longitudinal profiles, Zone 
                    5 sediments extended outward and graded into river terrace 
                    deposits immediately in front of the shelter. Excavations 
                    showed that the river channel lay directly in front of the 
                    shelter during at least a part of Zone 5 time. Occupational 
                    refuse from the shelter spilled over the river bank and was 
                    incorporated into the stream deposits that eventually filled 
                    the channel. Mixing of materials undoubtedly took place in 
                    the steep talus slopes on the old river bank. Consequently, 
                    it is not possible to accurately equate given parts of the 
                    terrace section of Zone 5 with equivalent parts within the 
                    shelter.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Zone 6.</b> This zone, the uppermost and 
                    youngest unit of shelter fill essentially was a midden (trash) 
                    deposit. It reached a maximum thickness of 30 inches (76 cm) 
                    within the shelter and consisted of loose, ashy, dust, charcoal, 
                    burned rock, bone, shell, pottery and various stone artifacts. 
                    These include Late Prehistoric artifacts as well as those 
                    dating to the Archaic. Some of the Archaic specimens are of 
                    Early Archaic affinity and indicate some mixing of deposits 
                    in the course of human utilization of the shelter. Also present 
                    are several Historic period artifacts of metal and glass from 
                    the last half of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries. 
                    Of particular interest are an 1857 U.S. half-dime and a brass 
                    button from a Confederate uniform jacket. </p>
                  <p class="text">Significantly, in Zone 6, the remains of modern 
                    bison (<em>Bison bison</em>) appear for the first time. There 
                    appears to have been a shift toward hunting larger animals&#151;such 
                    as deer and antelope&#151;and decreasing use of smaller animals, 
                    such as rabbits. According to Winans, this may indicate a 
                    change in what was available in the area.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the terrace section in front of the shelter, 
                    Zone 6 thickened to 36 to 40 inches (91 to 102 cm) and apparently 
                    represents the last stage of filling of the old, abandoned 
                    channel of the Sabinal River. Since the end of aboriginal 
                    occupation in Zone 6 time there has been very little erosion 
                    or deposition on the terrace surface in the immediate vicinity 
                    of the shelter.</p>
                  <h3>Disturbed Fill </h3>
                  <p class="text">The surface of the shelter fill was covered 
                    with backdirt from the treasure-hunters' pit as well as from 
                    a few smaller, shallow holes dug into the site prior to the 
                    1948 excavations. A large collection of artifacts was obtained 
                    by screening this material and included two additional Folsom 
                    points, a number of other early projectile points such as 
                    Golondrina, Midland, and Angostura, many Archaic and Late 
                    Prehistoric types, a fragmentary steatite vessel, decorated 
                    stones, bones, and other cultural evidence.</p>
