                  <p class="text">Ancient artisans were at work at Kincaid throughout 
                    much of its history. They selected flat pebbles on which to 
                    engrave intricate patterns and make odd scratchings&#151;designs 
                    that puzzle us today and cause us to ponder their meaning 
                    and significance. Some of the work is finely executed with 
                    parallel lines, grids, concentric circles, cross hatching, 
                    and other geometric patterns. </p>
                  <p class="text">Other designs&#151;particularly the marks on 
                    red and yellow ocher cobbles&#151;appear more random, as if 
                    someone scratched the surfaces repeatedly and from different 
                    angles. Unlike the engraved objects, these &quot;scratched&quot; 
                    stones likely were not &quot;works of art,&quot; as we understand 
                    the concept, but rather the &quot;ingredients&quot; of art. 
                    Scratching ocher stone with a sharp tool or crushing small 
                    ocher nodules produces a fine, pigment-rich powder that&#151;with 
                    a few added ingredients such as animal fat&#151;becomes paint. 
                    Working with a brilliantly hued palette of reds, oranges and 
                    yellows, artists could paint designs on hides, small pebbles, 
                    and cave walls, as well as bodies and faces. </p>
                  <p class="text">There are other odd stones at Kincaid that apparently 
                    were used for more practical purposes. Several large, flat 
                    pebbles have random marks suggesting that rather than pigment 
                    extraction, the stones were used as a hard surface for cutting 
                    soft materials. And a number of curious, small, flat limestone 
                    pebbles appear to be unmodified, devoid of any markings at 
                    all. The stones are chiefly Edwards limestone, which does 
                    not naturally occur in the shelter (Anacacho limestone formation). 
                    Clearly, prehistoric workers gathered these small pebbles 
                    from the river gravels and brought them into the shelter. 
                    Were these blank &quot;canvasses&quot; stockpiled for future 
                    artistry? Or were some once painted with special designs that 
                    have faded away with time and weathering.</p>
                  <p class="text">As you look at the various types of stones, 
                    below, perhaps you will have your own ideas about their meaning 
                    and significance. As will become evident, the stones cannot 
                    be neatly classified; some clearly were used for one or more 
                    different types of practical tasks, while others were more 
                    esoteric and served purposes we cannot know. For a closer 
                    look, images can be clicked on to view enlarged versions and, 
                    in some cases, the reverse sides of artifacts. In some images, 
                    contrast has been heightened to capture more detail. </p>
                  <p class="text">Many of the engraved and scratched stones as 
                    well as a quantity of the pigment stones from Kincaid were 
                    found in Zone 5, a few were from Zone 6, but there were many 
                    others found in disturbed fill, making it impossible to infer 
                    a relative time period for their production. Based on information 
                    from other sites, however, it appears that art in many forms 
                    was significant to prehistoric peoples, from the Paleolithic 
                    painters of the Old World to the most ancient Texans. </p>

                  <p class="text">Creating an engraved work of art must have been 
                    far more difficult than painting a pebble with a brush. The 
                    close work would have required a very sharp tool, such as 
                    a chipped stone graver, as well as good eyes and a steady 
                    hand.</p>
                  <p class="text">Perhaps for that reason, engraved stones are 
                    rare in Texas. Yet, interestingly, there are strong similarities 
                    in design motifs even within the small assemblage of known

                    at top right and below left, is nearly identical to that on

                    a counterpart for this design in a <em>painted</em> version, 
                    seen on some of the painted pebbles of the Lower Pecos. Stones 
                    with painted concentric circles and rayed lines were found 
                    at the base of Fate Bell Shelter and the base of Eagle Cave

                    spider and a recurring character known as Spider Grandmother. 
                    In her 1987 thesis on painted pebble designs Mock explains 
                    the myth further: &quot;By spinning ropes , Spider Grandmother 
                    was able to fasten the sky and earth together. Among the Plains 
                    Indians Spider Grandmother wove a magical spider-web by which 
                    she was able to control and produce buffalo.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">In his stylistic study of painted pebbles from 
                    the Lower Pecos, archeologist Mark Parsons placed the circle 
                    motif chronologically at the beginning of his sequence, dating 
                    perhaps to 8500 B.P.</p>
                  <p class="text">As T.N. Campbell has noted, &quot;It is clear 
                    that the designs on both painted and engraved pebbles were 
                    taken from the same design pool, as is shown by cross-hatched 
                    surfaces, various arrangements of parallel lines, and stylized 
                    female figures.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">Quite different and far earlier examples have 
                    been unearthed at the Gault site in Bell County. There archeologist 
                    Michael Collins and his team have recovered finely engraved 
                    pebbles from Clovis and later contexts. A single engraved 
                    stone was found in early Paleoindian contexts at the Wilson-Leonard 
                    site, and another in the Blackwater Draw Folsom component. 
                    These are among the earliest, securely dated engravings&#151;and 
                    perhaps the first art&#151;in North America.</p>

                    <span class="text">There are few reported sites in the area 
                    with such an abundance of pigment materials as was found at 
                    Kincaid Shelter. Campbell, who reviewed ethnographic and archeological 
                    records in conjunction with his Kincaid study, noted that 
                    even the dry rock shelter sites of far west Texas, with their 
                    painted pebbles and pictographs, did not have comparable variety 
                    and abundance of evidence. He notes: </span></p>
                  <p><span class="text"><em>The Kincaid data suggests a special 
                    interest in painting other than in rock art, which is minimally 
                    represented at the site. One thinks immediately of body painting, 
                    especially in connection with ceremonial activities. </em></span> 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">A further possibility, Campbell suggests, is 
                    use of pigment for the painting of bison and deer hides. In 
                    the early 16th century, the missionary Espinosa wrote of Indians 
                    (possibly Coahuiltecan) just south of the Edwards Plateau 
                    and their use of pigments. In his description of trade between 
                    Indians and Spaniards at colonial settlements near present-day 
                    Guerrero, Coahuila, Espinosa listed dressed skins of bison 
                    and deer, many painted with designs, among the commodities. 
                    The missionary writes:</p>
                  <p class="text"><em>The women are trained to cure and tan the 
                    hides of buffalo and deer. These they curiously painted to 
                    trade to the Spaniards... . The red and yellow dirt with which 
                    the Indians paint their hides...is hard. </em>(Father Espinosa's 
                    accounts were translated by Gabriel Tous and published in 
                    1930.)</p>
                  <p class="text">In the dry rock shelters of the western Edwards 
                    Plateau, archeologists have recovered a few small pieces of 
                    dressed animal skin with traces of painted decoration. Unfortunately, 
                    the damp conditions at Kincaid Shelter would have destroyed 
                    such perishable material and most other evidence of painted 
                    art work. </p>
                  <p class="text">Evidence from other sites suggests other uses 
                    for ocher, including an ingredient in mastic for hafting stone 
                    points on weapons and tools. Ocher also has been found in 
                    many burials at sites across the world, suggesting a ceremonial 
                    or symbolic meaning.</p>

            <p class="text"> In his analysis of the Kincaid collection, Campbell 
              found that a quantity of pebbles&#151;some 130 of them&#151;were 
              &quot;blank,&quot; apparently unmodified in any fashion. Most are 
              small, flat, pebbles of grayish Edwards limestone. He wrote, &quot;Whether 
              actually used or not, all were brought up from the river for some 
              intended use. They are not naturally occurring in the shelter.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">At other sites, especially rock shelters in the arid 
              canyonlands of southwest Texas, investigators have seen a similar 
              pattern. At Eagle Cave, for example, some 400 unmodified pebbles 
              were collected. The reason for special interest in pebbles of this 
              region is quite apparent: Some of the prehistoric populations of 
              the western Edwards Plateau and adjoining Lower Pecos painted interesting 
              designs on flat pebble surfaces. Since the paints did not always 
              survive the years, investigators collected miscellaneous pebbles 
              to inspect closer in the lab. These microscopic inspections often 
              revealed faint marks made from sharp-edged tools, others lightly 
              engraved.</p>
            <p class="text">The Kincaid artifacts have not been fully analyzed 
              or examined microscopically. There are, however, several other interesting 
              explanations for their presence at the site. Historic accounts of 
              native peoples, such as the Tarahumara Indians of Chihuahua, record 
              the use of small pebbles for both ritualistic and mundane uses. 
              Anthropologist Carl Lumholtz, during his late 19th-century visits, 
              noted that shamans rubbed small stones over male athletes prior 
              to games, and that women carried small thin stones to protect them 
              against sorcerers. Other enthnohistorians have described the use 
              of small pebbles as gaming pieces. Whether the Kincaid pebbles were 
              &quot;blank canvases&quot; stockpiled for future artistic endeavors, 
              or whether they served some other use, is unknown.</p>
