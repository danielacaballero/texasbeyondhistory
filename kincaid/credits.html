            <p class="text">The Kincaid Shelter exhibit is based on the work of 
              Glen Evans, Thomas N. Campbell, Michael B. Collins, Gene Mear, Melissa 
              C. Winans and Thomas R. Hester. TBH Co-Editor <b>Susan Dial </b>created 
              the exhibit and wrote most of the sections, examining many of the old collections and records to present new data and previously unpublished imagery. She also wrote the Time Travel student activity. Education editor <strong>Carol 
              Schlenk </strong>wrote the teachers curricula and &quot;Meet the Critters&quot; 
              student activity.  Webmaster <strong>Meg Kemp</strong> created image collages and 
              exhibits and executed the web programming, including interactive 
              student activities. <strong>Aaron Norment</strong> and <strong>Monica Trejo </strong>photographed 
              the artifacts from the TARL Collections.<strong> Dee Ann Story</strong>, Director 
              Emeritus of TARL, and <strong>Ernest Lundelius</strong>, Director Emeritus of the 
              UT-Austin Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory, served as reviewers 
              and provided helpful comments, as did Collins, Evans, Mear, Hester, 
              and Winans. The main page illustration was painted by <strong>Charles Shaw</strong>.</p>
            <p class="text">Work on the Kincaid exhibit was supported by grants 
              from the <strong>National Endowment for the Humanities </strong> 
              and the <strong>Texas Preservation Trust Fund</strong> (Texas Historical 
              Commission). Additional funding was provided by <strong>XTO Energy</strong>

              and the <strong>Council of Texas Archeologists</strong>.</p>
            <p class="text">A special fund benefitting the Kincaid Shelter project on TBH was created to honor the  memory of <strong>David Russell Mear</strong>, son of Gene and Tonie Mear, who died suddenly in April 2005. Many individuals, including Mear's family, friends, and Utopia area residents have contributed to this lasting tribute. </p>

            <p class="text">Our knowledge of Kincaid has been slowly evolving 
              since field investigations were completed in 1953. T.N. Campbell 
              and Glen Evans were determined to produce a report, an effort that 
              was later taken over by Michael B. Collins and Gene Mear. As yet, 
              comprehensive analysis and full reporting has not been accomplished. 
              In this exhibit, we have brought some of the unpublished material 
              to light and included short extracts and syntheses of articles by 
              these researchers, some of which may be read and downloaded as PDF 
              files (see citations below). </p>
          
		    <p class="text"><b>Glen Evans</b> directed excavations at the Kincaid 
              site in 1948. With broad expertise as a geologist, paleontologist, 
              and naturalist, he well fits the term, &quot;Renaissance man.&quot; 
              As Associate Director of the Texas Memorial Museum, Evans investigated 
              some of the most significant &quot;early man&quot; sites in Texas 
              and the southwest, including Lubbock Lake, Blackwater Draw, and 
              the Miami site, as well as the paleontological &quot;treasure trove,&quot; 
              Friesenhahn Cave. His multi-year excavations at the Odessa Meteor 
              site included the discovery and identification of three craters, 
              bringing new understanding to meteors on a worldwide scale. Over 
              his years of field work, Evans collected or acquired many of the 
              exemplary minerals and cultural artifacts on display at the TMM. 
              In his small volume of anecdotes titled, <em>Wildness at Risk,</em> 
              Evans reflects on the changes he has seen across the southwest landscape. 
              In tribute to his work, the Texas Memorial Museum mounted a display 
              entitled <em>The Compleat Naturalist</em> in downtown Austin. More 
              detailed information on his life and work is available at <a href="www.jsg.utexas.edu/npl/outreach/glen-evans-the-compleat-naturalist/" target="_blank" class="text">www.jsg.utexas.edu/npl/outreach/glen-evans-the-compleat-naturalist/</a>.</p>

              the University of Texas at Austin for more than 30 years, led UT 
              Field School operations at Kincaid in 1953. After analyzing much 
              of the Kincaid artifact collection, he began a draft report on the 
              site that was never finished. Best known as an ethnohistorian, Campbell 
              researched and wrote extensively on the historic Indian groups of 
              southern Texas and northeastern Mexico, including many obscure bands 
              known only through scant accounts by explorers and missionaries. 
              Campbell died in 2003.</p>

              project in the late 1980s, re-analyzing the Paleoindian materials 
              and identifying Clovis artifacts in the collection. A Research Associate 
              at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, he has worked with 
              prehistoric lithic collections from North, Central and South America 
              and Europe. In Texas, he has investigated several significant Paleoindian 
              sites, including Gault and Wilson-Leonard, and analyzed the Paleoindian 
              evidence from the Pavo Real site. Currently he is completing analysis 
              of Clovis materials from the Gault site for an upcoming monograph.<br>

              in Oklahoma, Colorado and Texas. A heart ailment in 1993 brought 
              his prospecting to a halt, but his retirement was short lived. He 
              joined Mike Collins at TARL in working on the Kincaid collection, 
              filling several ledger pads with columns of neatly enscribed measurements 
              and attributes of the hundreds of stone tools. He also did the aerial 
              geography of the Wilson-Leonard site, as well as various archeological
