                      <td valign="top"> 
                        <p class="text">Over the millennia, hundreds of people 
                          stayed in Kincaid Shelter, using the protected locale 
                          as a base for hunting animals, gathering plants, nuts 
                          and seeds, making tools, refurbishing gear, and carrying 
                          out other tasks of daily life. Others may have merely 
                          stopped there overnight during a longer journey. Like 
                          their modern counterparts, many of these prehistoric 
                          campers left behind a scattering of trash as well as 
                          a few more meaningful items that perhaps were lost or 
                          forgotten in the shelter's recesses. </p>
                        <p class="text">Yet what was trash to prehistoric and 
                          later peoples often holds special significance to researchers 
                          today. Even broken or spent weapons carry important 
                          technological and stylistic information which helps 
                          researchers understand life in the past. Discarded tools 
                          and toolmaking debris provide insights into the technologies 
                          and economies of the various prehistoric visitors. Animal 
                          bones inform researchers about the prehistoric diet 
                          and may indicate changes in climate and the environment 
                          over time. </p>
                        <p class="text">Unfortunately more than half of the artifacts 
                          recovered from Kincaid have no precise provenience, 
                          that is, they were out of place, having been dug up 
                          and discarded by treasure-hunters. Since the diggers 
                          were searching for gold and silver, they left the Indian 
                          artifacts behind in their backdirt piles. Prehistoric 
                          peoples churned the shelter deposits as well, perhaps 
                          digging pits into lower levels for hearths and, in the 
                          process, displacing and mixing items left by earlier 
                          visitors. For these reasons, many of the items from 
                          the shelter cannot be connected to a particular cultural 
                          group or time period.</p>
                        <p class="text">In this section we present a gallery of 
                          selected artifacts from Kincaid Shelter curated in the 
                          TARL Collections. While investigators did not collect 
                          or document all the items they encountered, as is the 
                          more standard practice today, they did recover a meaningful 
                          sample that provides a window into past activities and 
                          peoples at Kincaid. The artifacts have yet to be fully 
                          analyzed and reported, although T. N. Campbell did a 
                          preliminary classification as part of an unpublished 
                          report on Kincaid. Michael Collins and Gene Mear inventoried 
                          and measured many of the chipped stone items in the 
                          collection, and Collins did a more in-depth study of 
                          the Paleoindian materials. Parts of these data are used 
                          in descriptions below and in the <a href="revisited.html" class="text">Kincaid 
                          Revisited</a> section, which details Collins findings.

                          stone, bone, leather, sinew, shell, and plant fibers, 
                          these early craftsmen created weapons and tools, baskets 
                          and mats, grinding implements, clothing and sandals, 
                          ornaments, and works of art. Few perishable materials 
                          survived the damp conditions at Kincaid. We know from 
                          other sites in the more-arid western regions, however, 
                          that items of wood, fiber and other organic materials 
                          would have made up the bulk of prehistoric hunting and

                          variety of toolmaking gear and chipping debris. Prehistoric 
                          stone knappers would have used rounded hammerstones

                          larger pieces of chert (flint) or other stone suitable 
                          for flaking. Sharp-edged flakes derived from this process 
                          made efficient cutting tools in themselves, or could 
                          be chipped further and finished using finer tools, such 
                          as antler tines. For other tasks, chipped stone burins 
                          or gravers may have been used both for cutting and grooving 
                          bones and for ornamental incising. </p>

                          adzes, used in woodworking, boneworking, and perhaps 
                          hide scraping, were recovered from Kincaid. One type, 
                          known as Clear Fork tools or gouges (because of their 
                          initial classification at sites near the Clear Fork 
                          of the Brazos River in northwest Texas), encompasses 
                          both bifacial (chipped on both sides) and unifacial 
                          (chipped on only one side) forms used by prehistoric 
                          peoples from Paleoindian to Late Archaic times. Another 
                          type, termed Guadalupe tools because of their predominate 
                          distribution in the Guadalupe River basin of south Texas, 
                          are long, thick, and rounded with a sharply truncated 
                          bit (or working) end. At other sites, these tools have 
                          been found chiefly in Early Archaic contexts. More than 
                          25 Guadalupe tools were found at Kincaid. </p>
                        <p class="text">Prehistoric workers put these tools to 
                          heavy use, as is evidenced by battering and wear on 
                          the bits and by the reworking and gradual attrition 
                          of the tools. Tool bits broke off during use or were 
                          deliberately knocked off and re-sharpened by the workers 
                          to create a fresh, more acute-edged, and more effective 
                          working end, as is illustrated in the example above. 
                          The specimen at right has been reduced by use and/or 
                          successive resharpenings to a size roughly half that

                        <p class="text">UT-Austin archeologist Dale Hudler examined 
                          40 of the 45 Clear Fork tools from Kincaid in 1996 as 
                          part of a larger study to try to determine usage of 
                          195 tools of this form. Microscopic analysis of the 
                          bits, or beveled-edged ends, of the tools showed polish 
                          and striations which was then compared to that on replica 
                          tools used in a variety of experimental uses. Six Kincaid 
                          specimens (one bifacial and five unifacial) had a distinctive 
                          &quot;smooth, linear polish&quot; on the bit which Hudler 
                          correlated with use on a very hard contact material, 
                          such as bone or antler. </p>
                        <p class="text">Hudler also determined that the unifacial 
                          Clear Fork tools from Kincaid tended to be wider than 
                          most others in the statewide study. However, variations 
                          in shape, size, and bit end morphology of both unifacial 
                          and bifacial Clear Fork tools have not yet proven to 
                          be meaningful. More likely, these differences in morphology, 
                          particularly in length dimension, simply reflect use 
                          and resharpening.</p>

                          less utilitarian and practical than stone tools and

                          paint-making materials (see <b>Mysterious Stones</b> 
                          section), there were several artifacts of shell and 
                          bone likely worn for personal adornment as well as fragments 
                          of a probable steatite pipe. </p>

                          worn suspended around the neck as jewelry. There were 
                          also several pieces of bone that appear to have been 
                          beads. These hollow sections had been grooved and snapped, 
                          and were likely strung on a cord as a necklace.</p>

                          shell artifacts was scant, however, and this is doubtlessly 
                          due to damp conditions in the shelter which took their 
                          toll on these and other, even more perishable items

                          of a tubular pipe that, based on rim sections, was roughly 
                          2.5 inches (6.4 cm) in diameter. Soapstone is a metamorphic 
                          rock, a talc which occurs in both eastern and western 
                          parts of the United States. When freshly mined, it is 
                          soft and can be easily shaped with hand-held tools.

                          of the Kincaid vessel. In Texas, natural deposits closest 
                          to the site are in Hudspeth county to the west, or in 
                          the Llano Uplift, some 65 to 100 miles northeast of 
                          the Kincaid site.</p>

						<p class="text">During the late part of the prehistoric 
                          period (roughly A.D. 1300), Kincaid occupants began 
                          using pottery vessels to store food, water, and other 
                          resources. Investigators found some 50 pottery sherds, 
                          chiefly in the upper levels of terrace deposits in front 
                          of the shelter. At least three different pottery types 
                          are present, representing perhaps eight or nine different 
                          vessels. These include thin-walled, bone-tempered sherds 
                          (typically referred to as Leon Plain) and a thicker 
                          version with vertical lines scored across the exterior 
                          (cf., Boothe Brushed). Other sherds had a sandy texture 
                          and apparent grog temper (crushed pottery sherds mixed 
                          into the clay paste). Prehistoric potters used various 
                          tempering agents, or additives, including sand, grit, 
                          crushed shell, and bone, to improve the clay texture 
                          and cause more even drying and firing. </p>
                        <p class="text">Pottery-making technology was late to 
                          catch on over much of what is now central and south 
                          Texas. The Caddo villagers of east Texas made exceptional 
                          pottery as early as 1000 years ago. The pottery at Kincaid 
                          was made during the latter part of the Late Prehistoric 
                          (Toyah interval, circa 400 to 700 years ago) and some 
                          of it (the Leon Plain sherds) can be attributed to mobile 
                          groups who used Perdiz arrowpoints and a distinctive 
                          tool set associated with buffalo-hunting. Similar sherds 
                          were identified at the nearby La Jita site.</p>

                          at Kincaid, indicating the presence of visitors&#151;hunters, 
                          fishermen, soldiers (or former soldiers), ranchers, 
                          and picnickers&#151;from the 1850s to modern times. 
                          Along with a variety of ammunition, metal construction 
                          materials, and glass, investigators found an 1857 half-dime 
                          and a brass button from a Confederate infantry officer's 
                          uniform. T.N. Campbell, in communicating with a militray 
                          expert in San Antonio, learned that the button likely 
                          is attributable to an officer on the staff of General 
                          H.H. Sibley, who led a brigade through the area of Sabinal 
                          in 1861 en route to New Mexico.</p>

                        <p>Dear Col. Crimmins,</p>
                        <p> I wonder if I might draw on your great store of military 
                          knowledge for help in identifying a brass button found 
                          in the top six inches of an archaeological site near 
                          Sabinal. It appears to be from a military uniform. It 
                          is 19.5 mm in diameter&#133; . The top is convex and 
                          has a loop for an attachment and is stamped &quot;P. 
                          Tait &amp; Co., Limerick.&quot; Incidentally, at the 
                          same level came a U.S. Half Dime, 1857&#133;</p>
                        <p>Any light you may be able to throw on this button will 
                          be much appreciated.<br>
                          Sincerely yours, <br>
                          T.N. Campbell, Chairman</p></div>

                                (near Kincaid Shelter) were not uniformed, therefore 
                                the button may have dropped from the jacket of 
                                troops in Gen. H.H. Sibley's brigade who passed 
                                through Sabinal en route to New Mexico. The brigade
