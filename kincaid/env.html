                  <p class="text">Kincaid Shelter (41UV2) is a stratified archeological 
                    site in Uvalde County, Texas, an area poised between the verdant, 
                    rugged beauty of the Hill Country and the more desert-like 
                    plains of South Texas. Carved into a low limestone bluff of 
                    the Cretaceous-age Anacacho formation, the shelter extends 
                    inward to form a semi-circular &quot;room&quot; roughly 32 
                    feet deep by 35 feet wide (about 10 by 11 meters) in size. 
                    The shelter ceiling is an irregular dome, a feature which 
                    suggests that the shelter may have formed as a solution cavern 
                    later dissected by the river cutting into the bluff. </p>
                  <p class="text">The shelter is located in the Balcones Fault 
                    zone near the northern edge of the Rio Grande Plain. There, 
                    the low flat land of the coastal plain gives way to a belt 
                    of low rolling hills and rocky terrain that marks the southern 
                    margin of the Edwards Plateau. Changes in surface elevation 
                    are abrupt, ranging from about 900 feet (275 m) above sea 
                    level near the shelter to more than 1,900 feet (582 m) above 
                    sea level on the plateau. The climate of the region is semi-arid, 
                    and in the vicinity of the Kincaid Shelter (as well as farther 
                    south) the climate is somewhat hotter and drier than on the 
                    higher plateau. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Kincaid Shelter lies within an ecotone, 
                    or transitional zone between different plant communities&#151;the 
                    Tamaulipan biotic province of the coastal plain and the Balconian 
                    biotic province of the Edwards Plateau. For prehistoric peoples, 
                    this meant a rich mix of resources&#151;nuts, fruits, seeds, 
                    and various kinds of wildlife&#151;was available nearby. By 
                    striking off in different directions, different sets of resources 
                    were encountered.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Tamaulipan is dominated by thorny and arid-adapted 
                    brush such as mesquite, acacia, cenizo, white brush, prickly 
                    pear and tasajillo. Within the Balconian province, oak and 
                    juniper savannas dominate the uplands and slopes and hardwood 
                    forests line canyons and valleys. Bald cypress, sycamore, 
                    black willow, pecan, black walnut, and other trees thrive 
                    along more-permanent streams. Species characteristic of both 
                    biotic provinces occur in the immediate vicinity of Kincaid 
                    Shelter.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Sabinal River today flows within 500 feet 
                    of the shelter. Its headwaters lie about 40 miles to the north 
                    on the Edwards Plateau. Within the plateau, the river is deeply 
                    entrenched in Cretaceous limestones of the Glen Rose, Comanche 
                    Peak, and Edwards formations. Springs issuing from the porous 
                    Glen Rose maintain a nearly permanent flow of water for a 
                    distance of 20 to 25 miles. During periods of normal flow, 
                    the water disappears underground at the Balcones Fault zone 
                    not far upstream from Kincaid Shelter. The water drains into 
                    thick streambed gravels and through a series of fractures 
                    in the Edwards Limestone. During major floods, the Sabinal 
                    flows across the fault zone and onto the Gulf Coastal Plain 
                    where it joins the Frio River. </p>
                  <p class="text">At Kincaid Shelter, the Sabinal is dry most 
                    of the time, but a semi-permanent pool is present about 2500 
                    feet (762 meters) downstream. This pool has been known to 
                    dry-up in historical times (e.g. summer of 1953), but standing 
                    water persisted in another pool about one-half mile upstream 
                    from the shelter. A pool also remained about three miles downstream 
                    during the prolonged drought of the 1950s.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the vicinity of the shelter, the Sabinal 
                    River bed is floored with modern limestone gravel bars that 
                    rise 6 to 8 feet above the river bed. An incipient flood plain 
                    (alluvial terrace), whose surface averages about 14 feet above 
                    the stream bed, also occurs as disconnected &quot;bench&quot; 
                    segments along the present channel. These modern deposits, 
                    still in the process of active development, are not directly 
                    related to any of the cultural material in the Kincaid Shelter.</p>
                  <p class="text">An older, well-developed alluvial terrace is 
                    closely related to the cultural deposits in and near the shelter. 
                    This terrace abuts the bluff that contains the Kincaid Shelter, 
                    and some of the upper deposits within the shelter extend outward 
                    and are incorporated into the terrace material. The terrace 
                    surface extends as a broad brush-covered flat from the bluff 
                    to the present river channel, and lies about 25 feet (7.6 
                    m) above the river bed. According to local ranchers, floods 
                    have spread across the terrace several times since 1900. These 
                    major floods have not much modified the level of the terrace 
                    surface, as there has been only a small amount of deposition 
                    or erosion since the latest aboriginal occupation in the area. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The age of the oldest part of the 25-foot terrace 
                    is not known. Archaic-period cultural materials and modern 
                    faunal remains (animal bones) are present in the upper part 
                    of the terrace in front of the shelter. Thus, the terrace 
                    reached its final development in the Holocene (modern) geological 
                    period. This terrace deposit is equivalent to the second terrace 
                    that occurs in the upper Sabinal River valley of the Edwards 
                    Plateau.</p>
                  <p class="text">Viewed over the millennia, the land has constantly 
                    changed and continues to do so. Looking back to the time of 
                    the first peoples at Kincaid, the scene would have appeared 
                    quite different from what we see today. During the relatively 
                    cool and moist Late Pleistocene period, the Sabinal was a 
                    more constantly flowing river able to support wildlife such 
                    as alligators and aquatic turtles, as indicated by faunal 
                    material from the lower deposits of the shelter. Megafauna&#151;mammoth 
                    and large bison&#151;as well as camel, horse, and sloth roamed 
                    the region.</p>
                  <p class="text">The climate appears to have experienced a relatively 
                    brief dry period sometimes called the Clovis Drought around 
                    13,000 years ago. By 12,000 years ago the climate shifted 
                    to a moderately moist period that lasted to perhaps 9,000 
                    years ago, followed by a prolonged period of warm and dry 
                    conditions that lasted for over 4,000 years punctuated by 
                    a a brief moist interlude sometime between 5,000 and 6,000 
                    years ago. By about 4,000 years ago, the climate shifted back 
                    to somewhat wetter conditions similar to the modern climate. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">As the climate fluctuated between dry and moist 
                    periods over time, the vegetation and animal communities shifted 
                    as well. Prehistoric hunters and gatherers, keenly attuned 
                    to the land and its changing resources, would have adapted 
                    or moved on. </p>

                          As shown, Kincaid Shelter lies in an ecotone or transition 
                          zone between the semi-arid, thorny brushlands of the 
                          Tamaulipan province and the oak-juniper savannas of 
                          the Balconian province. This mosaic of environments 
                          with diverse resources likely made the area attractive
