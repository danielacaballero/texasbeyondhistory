            <p><em>Some 13,000 years ago in the Texas Hill Country, a band of travelers
              discovered a broad, cave-like shelter in the chalky limestone bluffs
              above the Sabinal River. Within the shelter's deep recesses, the
              group found protection from wind and rain and refuge from the large
              carnivores that roamed the Edwards Plateau and Sabinal River valley.
              </em></p>
            <p><em>It was an area rich in resources&#151;abundant water, food,
              fuel, and the materials for making tools&#151;and the group found
              it worth the effort to make the damp shelter into a more comfortable
              home. But to do so was not a simple task. The process involved hauling
              heavy stone cobbles&#151;some weighing as much as 70 pounds each
              and totaling more than two tons&#151;up from the river bed below
              and into the shelter to pave the muddy floor. Women and children
              may have handled the job, carrying the stone in leather pouches
              or baskets, laying them carefully in a tight pattern, and then filling
              the gaps in between with tiny pebbles. Finally, the workers likely
              cushioned the hard pavement by adding layers of grass and branches
              and covering it all over with animal skins. The damp shelter had
              become a comfortable living place.</em></p>

                    of its construction, the stone pavement at Kincaid Rockshelter
                    provides a rare glimpse into the mindset and way of life of
                    some of North America's earliest peoples. There is no doubt
                    that improving the shelter required considerable effort and
                    signified that the people who built it intended to stay for
                    a while, re-tooling their weapons and staging hunts and other
                    expeditions from that locale. But who were the builders, and
                    what was their life like, there on the banks of the Sabinal?
                      </span>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Based on a small array of distinctive tools
                    and the bones of now-extinct animals deeply buried in the
                    shelter's deposits, University of Texas archeologist Michael B. Collins believes
                    these early Hill Country stone masons were Clovis peoples.
                    If he is correct&#151;and all evidence appears to support
                    this&#151;<b>the Kincaid stone pavement is the oldest known
                    structural feature in North America.</b> </p>
                  <p class="text">Located some 60 miles west of San Antonio, Texas,
                    Kincaid Shelter is significant as one of a mere handful of
                    Clovis-period <em>occupation sites</em>&#151;a place where people
                    lived and invested their labor, unlike more-temporary open
                    camp sites and animal &quot;kill&quot; sites. As such, Kincaid
                    helps take our knowledge of Clovis beyond the oft-repeated
                    stereotype of &quot;nomadic big-game hunters following the
                    herds&quot; to a picture of ancient peoples who selected a
                    place to stay for an extended period, improved their accommodations,
                    and explored the full bounty of the area's resources. </p>
                  <p class="text">Beyond Clovis, Kincaid Shelter also holds a
                    long record of later prehistoric peoples. Countless generations
                    of travelers and campers left behind tantalizing reminders
                    of their stay along the Sabinal River&#151;Folsom hunters
                    on the trail of a wounded bison, a succession of Archaic period
                    peoples, and Late Prehistoric pottery makers and hunters wielding
                    bows and arrows. In more recent times, a traveler wearing
                    a Confederate uniform jacket lost a button in front of the
                    shelter, perhaps en route to battle in New Mexico. Over the
                    millennia, deep layers of sediment and human debris filled
                    the shelter and formed a thick terrace deposit outside. </p>
                  <p class="text">Twentieth-century visitors, however, left a
                    very different imprint in Kincaid shelter&#151;gaping holes
                    and mounds of shoveled-out backdirt. Searching for legendary
                    riches made famous by Texas writers such as J. Frank Dobie,
                    treasure hunters mined the deeply layered deposits of Kincaid
                    Shelter and, in the process, nearly destroyed its rich archeological
                    potential. When a young college student brought the site to
                    the attention of researchers, the fate of Kincaid Shelter
                    was changed, however, and its systematic exploration was begun.</p>
                  <p class="text">Archeological investigations at Kincaid Shelter
                    were conducted in late 1948 under the direction of Elias H.
                    Sellards and Glen Evans from the Texas Memorial Museum in
                    Austin. One of the missions of the Austin museum, like others
                    across the country at the time, was to find and collect artifacts
                    of &quot;early man&quot; to fill displays and exhibits. Many
                    such collecting operations were done haphazardly, with an
                    eye more for the objects themselves than for understanding
                    their context.</p>
                  <p class="text">Fortunately, Evans and Sellards took a more
                    scientific approach that was to be particularly critical in
                    verifying the age of the deepest cultural layers. As geologists,
                    Evans and Sellards were keenly aware of the importance of
                    depositional processes and stratigraphy. After clearing and
                    sifting the backdirt, they excavated a deep trench from the
                    front to the back of the shelter in order to gauge the depth
                    and character of the shelter fill. This critical process,
                    unusual by archeological standards of the time, provided a
                    vertical &quot;window&quot; to view the complex layers of
                    shelter deposits and guided further excavations. </p>
                  <p class="text">Five years later, University of Texas anthropology
                    professor Thomas Nolan Campbell led a field school to investigate
                    the deep terrace deposits directly in front of the shelter.
                    Although it later became evident that the deepest layers of
                    the terrace formed after the critical Late Pleistocene &quot;early
                    man&quot; levels inside the shelter, the terrace investigation
                    provided additional information on the Archaic and more-recent
                    cultures. </p>

                    to trials and errors with trailblazing scientific techniques,
