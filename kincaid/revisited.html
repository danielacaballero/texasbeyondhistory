                                Man in North America</u>. The site is of interest, 
                                he noted, "as one of the southernmost localities 
                                at which typical Folsom points are known to occur." Sellards, who directed investigations at the site 
                                in 1948, made no mention of the stone pavement. 
                                The Clovis artifacts from the site had not yet 
                                been recognized. </p>

                                since the 1950s: the pointed distal section on 
                                display at the Texas Memorial Museum, and the

                        <p class="text">There are aspects of serendipity and no 
                          small amount of irony in the Kincaid discoveries, beginning 
                          with Gene Mear's find of a Folsom point in the backdirt 
                          piles left by treasure hunters. Had it not been for 
                          the destructive activity of the treasure seekers, Mear 
                          would not have discovered the Paleoindian points, scientific 
                          investigations might never have taken place, and the 
                          ancient stone pavement at Kincaid Shelter might never 
                          have been uncovered. </p>
                        <p class="text">The serendipity was to continue and come 
                          full circle in subsequent years.</p>
                        <p class="text">In the early 1950s, findings from Kincaid 
                          Shelter were showcased in what became a longstanding 
                          exhibit at the Texas Memorial Museum in Austin. Along 
                          with a selection of artifacts, a section of the ancient 
                          stone pavement was recreated and displayed. The text 
                          for the exhibit explained that, while evidence of the 
                          Folsom culture was found at the site, it was not known 
                          what <em>ancient civilization</em> had constructed the 
                          stone pavement&#151;the thinking of the time perhaps 
                          being that brutish hunter-gatherers would have had neither 
                          the organizational skills nor the inclination to put 
                          forth the effort required.</p>
                        <p class="text">UT-Austin archeologist Michael Collins 
                          recalls visiting the Kincaid exhibit as a young boy, 
                          pressing his face against the glass display window, 
                          and wondering about the ancient people who had created 
                          the stone floor in the shelter. The question was to 
                          nag him over the years as he went off to college and 
                          began studying archeology and prehistoric cultures.</p>
                        <p class="text">In 1988, armed with a Ph.D and some 20 
                          years experience in the field, Collins obtained permission 
                          to examine the Kincaid artifacts, still on display at 
                          the museum. One specimen caught his attention&#151;the 
                          tip of a broken biface that had been recovered from 
                          Zone 4. Looking at the flake scars on the fragment, 
                          Collins recalls, &quot;I knew that was Clovis technology.&quot; 
                          At the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, where 
                          the bulk of the Kincaid collection had been curated, 
                          Collins examined the rest of the collection. There, 
                          among a bag of triangular bifaces classified as &quot;Kinney&quot; 
                          type specimens, Collins spotted a fragment with a fluted 
                          base and unusual flaking pattern.</p>
                        <p class="text">He held up the basal fragment next to 
                          the photo of the tip from the museum display. The break 
                          on the object in his hand was a mirror image of the 
                          one in the museum display. After 40 years of being housed 
                          in two different facilities, the two pieces were joined 
                          together. It was, as Collins had suspected, a Clovis 
                          preform, broken by an ancient knapper attempting to 
                          make a spear point some 13,000 years ago.</p>
                        <h3><a name="b"></a>The Case for Clovis</h3>
                        <p class="text">For Collins, the mystery of who had built 
                          the stone floor at Kincaid had been answered. In subsequent 
                          years, as he begun delving into early Paleoinidan tool-making 
                          technology, Collins identified other Clovis artifacts 
                          from the Kincaid collection&#151;an expended conical 
                          blade core, more fluted bifaces and preforms, and other 
                          distinctive knapping debris.</p>
                        <p class="text">Collins also interviewed longtime friend 
                          and mentor Glen Evans, who had excavated the site in 
                          1948, &quot;picking his brain&quot; for recollections 
                          about other artifacts, such as long thin, Clovis blades&#151;another 
                          distinctive Clovis signature&#151;which might not have 
                          been collected at the time. (During the 1940s and 1950s, 
                          it was not standard procedure to collect all lithic 
                          materials found during archeological excavations.) Evans 
                          was certain there had been no thin blades in Zone 4.</p>
                        <p class="text"> Gene Mear, who had retired after a successful 
                          career in petroleum geology, later joined Collins in 
                          examining the site records and re-inventorying the Kincaid 
                          collection, measuring and recording attributes on the 
                          chipped stone tools.</p>
                        <p class="text">Having sifted through the collection and 
                          the records for any other possible evidence pertaining 
                          to Zone 4, Collins and his colleagues summed up the 
                          newly identified Clovis lithic materials from Kincaid 
                          in a short article in<b> </b><em>Current Research in

                          had proved unsuccessful. In 1953, upon learning of the 
                          pioneering new radiocarbon dating techniques being tested 
                          by Willard Libby, Evans had begun a persistent letter-writing 
                          campaign to include some of the Kincaid samples in the 
                          study. Because some of the samples were from contexts 
                          associated with diagnostic projectile points or Late 
                          Pleistocene fauna&#151;and thus placed in a relative 
                          chronological framework&#151;Libby finally accepted 
                          several samples as good test cases for his new technique. 
                          In each case, however, the results were unsatisfactory&#151;either 
                          far too young or too old based on the evidence at hand. 
                          Several of the samples used were snail shells, bone, 
                          and other materials which are now known to require special 
                          calibrations and processing methods. (Over the ensuing 
                          years, Libby improved his technique and was awarded 
                          the 1960 Nobel prize for his work.)</p>
                        <p class="text">In 1990, Collins tried again, submitting 
                          two painstakingly collected samples of charcoal to the 
                          Lawrence Livermore Laboratory at the University of California-Berkeley 
                          for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating. A major 
                          advance over standard radiocarbon dating, this revolutionary 
                          new technique can evaluate the age of even minute samples 
                          of charcoal. The two Kincaid charcoal samples, Collins 
                          recalls, looked like &quot;flecks from a pepper shaker.&quot; 
                          Using tweezers, he extracted the first speck from the 
                          surface of a lump of travertine that had been collected 
                          from Zone 4. The resulting radiocarbon age estimate 
                          of that sample proved to be unsatisfactory, perhaps 
                          contaminated during initial collection or storage. </p>
                        <p class="text">To produce a second sample, Collins crushed 
                          the travertine lump and removed a charcoal fleck from 
                          the interior. This sample brought results&#151;an AMS 
                          radiocarbon age estimate of 9910 +/-250 years before 
                          present, or, in calendar years, roughly 12,000 years 
                          old. What this established, in effect, was an end date 
                          for the accumulation of Zone 4 deposits. </p>
                        <h3><a name="d"></a>Haunting Questions</h3>
                        <p class="text"><b>Did Folsom people live in Kincaid Shelter?</b> 
                        <p class="text"> Five Folsom points were recovered from 
                          disturbed contexts at Kincaid, and these points are 
                          interesting in several regards. They are all essentially 
                          complete, except for minor impact fractures on three. 
                          But it appears that they are the <em>only</em> evidence 
                          of Folsom people at the site. According to Collins, 
                          there is no other artifact&#151;such as channel flakes, 
                          distinctive fluted preforms, or fragments of Folsom 
                          points&#151; that can be attributed to a Folsom assemblage 
                          from the site. No recognizable chipping debris or Folsom 
                          manufacturing failures (broken tools) were identified. 
                          As opposed to evidence of habitation, the five virtually 
                          unbroken points are more characteristic of a kill sites.</p>
                        <p class="text">Collins notes that since all five points 
                          came from the backdirt of the large pit, they evidently 
                          laid in close proximity near the back of the shelter 
                          at one time. The points did not have any travertine 
                          coating and, therefore, seem to post-date Zone 4. The 
                          articulated leg bones of a single bison lay on the surface 
                          of a travertine deposit at the contact between Zone 
                          4 and Zone 5, adjacent to the largest pit. </p>
                        <p class="text">A very intriguing and plausible explanation 
                          of these circumstances has been proposed by Dr. Dee 
                          Ann Story, who as a student dug at Kincaid in 1953. 
                          In her hypothesis, Folsom hunters may have wounded a 
                          bison with multiple darts. The bison apparently escaped 
                          and perhaps sought refuge in the shelter. It died of 
                          its wounds on the floor of the shelter (then the upper 
                          surface of Zone 4) at a spot later penetrated by the 
                          treasure-hunters. Their digging dislodged the majority 
                          of the bison skeleton and all of the points, leaving 
                          only the articulated limb bones found adjacent to the 
                          pit at the contact between Zones 4 and 5.</p>
                        <p class="text">Unfortunately, the nature of the Folsom 
                          presence at Kincaid will remain a matter of speculation. 
                          Because the deposit containing Folsom materials was 
                          evidently almost totally disrupted by a treasure-hunters' 
                          pit, it must not have covered a large area to begin 
                          with.</p>
                        <p class="text"><b>What was the size and 
                          lifestyle of the Clovis group?</b></p>
                        <p class="text">Because of a variety of disturbances to 
                          the deposits and because of incomplete recovery of artifacts 
                          by investigators, our picture of the ancient groups 
                          who stayed at Kincaid will remain blurred. Based on 
                          the size of the stone pavement section uncovered during 
                          controlled excavations&#151; roughly 10 square meters&#151;it 
                          is clear that ancient builders expended substantial 
                          effort in its making, But there is no way of knowing 
                          what its original, full dimensions might have been. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">Lacking that evidence, speculation about 
                          group size is rather meaningless. However, the shelter 
                          is large&#151;roughly 35 by 32 feet, or 10 by 11 meters. 
                          As Collins has noted, even though the known paved area 
                          is comparatively small, it required considerable effort 
                          to construct. These facts, he adds, suggest a group 
                          of sufficient size to have required the entire floor 
                          space of the shelter. And they would have intended to 
                          stay sufficiently long to warrant the effort to build 
                          the pavement.</p>
                        <p class="text">Based on the artifact evidence, it seems 
                          clear that the shelter was used as a habitation and 
                          as a Clovis &quot;workshop&quot; for making chipped 
                          stone tools. We can imagine a scene13,000 years ago 
                          when a Clovis craftsman, perhaps wielding a heavy antler 
                          baton, struck blades off a small chert core. Another 
                          worker may have refreshed his hunting gear by pulling 
                          a broken black-glass projectile point from a dart shaft 
                          and replacing it with a new tip. </p>
                        <p class="text">With the exception of the obsidian point, 
                          the tool stone chosen, almost uniformly, was local Edwards 
                          chert, based on appearance and on a cursory scan with 
                          ultra violet light by Collins. The resharpened Clovis 
                          point found at Kincaid is of interest in this regard. 
                          As Collins notes in his study, <em>Clovis Blade Technology</em> 
                          (1999, University of Texas Press), the fact that the 
                          discarded point at Kincaid was made of the same local 
                          material as the knapping debris indicates a return to 
                          the same chert source within the use-life-span of the 
                          points.</p>
                        <h3><a name="c"></a>The Kincaid Legacy</h3>
                        <p class="text">With the analysis and identification of 
                          the Clovis artifacts, Kincaid Shelter took its place 
                          in a relatively small universe of early Paleoindian 
                          sites. Several aspects distinguish it from others, while 
                          other Kincaid evidence provides support for an ongoing 
                          shift in our thinking about these early groups. </p>

                            reported construction in North America, some 13,000 
                            years old. </b>At other sites, such as Hell Gap and 
                            Agate Basin, investigators have found the remains 
                            of possible tent stakes made of bone or tusk, but 
                            these sites are younger than Kincaid by 1,000 to 1,500 
                            years. At the Vail site in Maine, there is an arrangement 
                            of huge boulders, cobbles, and chipped stone tools 
                            on a stream-side gravel bar. Although their arrangement 
                            is circular, the boulders are too massive to have 
                            been moved by humans. It is possible they were used 
                            as supports for some sort of structure. <br>
                            <br>
                            There is also a suspected Clovis-age structural feature&#151;a 
                            rectangular gravel pavement&#151;that was uncovered 
                            at the Gault site north of Austin, but findings from 
                            this major Clovis occupation site are still being 
                            analyzed by Collins, the lead investigator, and his

                            According to Collins, Kincaid is the only site with 
                            indisputable evidence of Clovis-period construction, 
                            and &quot;there is the bone of an extinct horse lying 
                            right on top of the pavement.&quot; Further, because 
                            the site was excavated by geologists employing stratigraphic 
                            principles, there is very sound stratigraphic context 
                            for the pavement. Their geologic observations on the 
                            type and arrangement of the limestone cobbles used 
                            for paving stones (Edwards vs. Anacacho formation) 
                            established further that it was not created by natural 
                            forces, such as spalling.</li>

				  <p class="text">Looking at the Kincaid collection today, it 
                    is tragic to see that some of the most intriguing and potentially 
                    informative specimens are labeled with the lot number &quot;908-2&quot; 
                    and other numbers which signify, &quot;provenience unknown.&quot; 
                    What this has meant for researchers is that the items left 
                    by prehistoric peoples camped in the shelter perhaps 12,000 
                    years ago were unearthed and mixed together with those left 
                    by shelter dwellers perhaps 8,000 or 5,000 or even 500 years 
                    ago. For the most part, any meaningful connections among cultural 
                    remains of the same time period have been lost. </p>
                  <p class="text">While mixed deposits in archeological sites 
                    are common, natural disturbances such as erosion or rodent 
                    burrowing often are found to have been the cause. Prehistoric 
                    people also disturbed earlier evidence simply by camping on 
                    top of it, by recycling tools or stones from earlier hearths, 
                    and by digging pits into earlier deposits. What archeologists 
                    hope to prevent through continued education efforts is the 
                    knowing destruction of historic sites by individuals who want 
                    to collect a few more projectile points which, when separated 
                    from their context, offer little insight into the people and 
                    cultures who made them. </p>
