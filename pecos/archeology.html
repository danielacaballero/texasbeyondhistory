                  <p class="text">The Lower Pecos Canyonlands, with its remarkable concentration 
                    of rockshelters and polychrome rock paintings, offers unique 
                    opportunities to study how hunter-gatherers adapted to a semi-arid 
                    environment. The archeology of the region provides one of 
                    the best preserved and longest records of hunter-gatherer 
                    lifeways in North America. Since the economy of hunter-gatherer 
                    groups is closely tied to the land on which they make a living, 
                    the archeological remains should closely reflect the nature 
                    of the environment. For example, much of the debris recovered 
                    from midden deposits within some rockshelters and in many 
                    open campsites is associated with the use of earth ovens to 
                    cook agave, sotol, yucca, and other root foods. The images 
                    painted on the canyon and cave walls reflect a belief system 
                    very closely tied to plants and animals characteristic of 
                    the region. </p>
                  <h3>History of Investigations</h3>
                  <p class="text">Archeological research in the region began in 
                    the early 1930's with excavations sponsored by the Witte Museum 
                    of San Antonio, the Smithsonian Institution, and the University 
                    of Texas at Austin. The most extensive investigations included 
                    work at Fate Bell Shelter by A.T. Jackson of the University 
                    of Texas, the Witte Museum excavations of Shumla Caves, and 
                    digs at Goat and Moorehead Caves for the Smithsonian. During 
                    this time, A.T. Jackson and Forrest Kirkland began documenting 
                    the remarkable rock paintings of the region. </p>
                  <p class="text">The next great push in research was triggered 
                    by the construction of Amistad Reservoir near the confluence 
                    of the Pecos and Devils Rivers with the Rio Grande. The National 
                    Park Service established the Archeological Salvage Program 
                    field office, which was later placed under the control of 
                    the University of Texas and renamed the Texas Archeological 
                    Salvage Project. Survey, testing, and several large-scale 
                    excavation projects were carried out beginning in the late 
                    1950s and continuing through the mid-1960s. Numerous rockshelters 
                    were partially excavated including Bonfire Shelter, Centipede 
                    Cave, Conejo Shelter, Coontail Spin Cave, Damp Cave, Eagle 
                    Cave, and Parida Cave. Two deeply stratified sites located 
                    on river terraces were also investigated, Arenosa Shelter 
                    near the confluence of the Pecos River and the Rio Grande, 
                    and the Devils Mouth Site at the confluence of the Devils 
                    River and the Rio Grande. </p>
                  <p class="text">After the completion of the Amistad Reservoir 
                    salvage project, extensive excavations were conducted in the 
                    1970s at Hinds Cave by Texas A&amp;M University and at Baker 
                    Cave by the University of Texas at San Antonio (the latter 
                    continuing into the early 1980s). Both of these rockshelters 
                    proved to have dry deposits rich in perishable material remains 
                    as well as deep deposits with evidence of occupations going 
                    back 10,000 years or more. Beginning in the mid 1970s, the 
                    State of Texas acquired Fate Bell Shelter and surrounding 
                    properties and established Seminole Canyon State Historical 
                    Park. Prior to the opening of the park, research included 
                    a survey of archeological resources and the excavation of 
                    Seminole Sink, a prehistoric cemetery in a sinkhole cave. 
                    In 1984, additional excavations were carried out at Bonfire 
                    Shelter. Since the 1980s, no major excavations have been undertaken 
                    in the Lower Pecos.</p>
                  <p class="text">Research into the rock paintings of the region 
                    has been fairly active over the last three decades. Solveig 
                    Turpin was the first archeologist to examine the role of rock 
                    art in the foraging societies of the region. She refined the 
                    definitions of the rock art styles, and began to tie the images 
                    depicted in the paintings to both ritual and subsistence activities. 
                    Carolyn Boyd continued to refine methods in the study of rock 
                    paintings and devised an interdisciplinary approach to rock 
                    art research and interpretation. She also maintains that many 
                    of the rock paintings constitute pre-planned panels, the product 
                    of an individual artisan.</p>
                  <h3>Beyond Rockshelters and Rock Art</h3>
                  <p class="text">Although rockshelters and caves have been the 
                    focus of most archeological investigation in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, 
                    there are many other kinds of sites, few of which have been 
                    studied in detail. The site types can be divided into two 
                    general categories, sheltered and open. (See <a href="rockshelters.html">Rockshelters</a>                    and <a href="art.html">Rock Art</a> sections for discussion of the sheltered sites.) Open 
                    sites include burned rock middens, bedrock mortar holes, rock 
                    alignments, ceramic scatters, and terrace sites along the 
                    major streams and rivers. </p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Terrace Sites</b>: Although most open sites 
                    in the region are shallow, there are deep, well-layered sites 
                    on the floodplains (alluvial terraces), particularly where 
                    major streams come together and where side canyons enter major 
                    streams. Unfortunately, a great many of the deepest and most 
                    important terrace sites were inundated by Amistad Reservoir 
                    and were never studied.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Lithic Quarries</b>: Quarry or &quot;lithic 
                    procurement&quot; sites are places where outcrops of flint 
                    (chert) occur, either eroding from the limestone bedrock or 
                    as ancient gravel deposits left tens of thousands of years 
                    ago by ancient rivers. Prehistoric peoples made extensive 
                    use of flint rocks, so much so that chipping debris can often 
                    be found scattered over wide areas. Archeologists sometimes 
                    have difficulty in deciding how to document quarry sites simply 
                    because they can be very large and rarely have neat boundaries. 
                    They are also problematic because most of the chipping debris 
                    cannot be dated&#151;many quarries were likely visited over 
                    and over by hunter-gatherers over thousands of years.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Hearth Fields and Middens</b>: Perhaps the 
                    most abundant and permanent evidence of human occupation in 
                    the Lower Pecos Canyonlands is that left by the practice of using heated 
                    or hot-rock cooking techniques. Archeologically, the sites 
                    with abundant evidence of hot-rock cooking are called hearth 
                    fields, ring middens, and burned rock middens. They can occur 
                    on stream (alluvial) terraces, on hill slope (colluvial) terraces, 
                    or on shallow rocky soils in the uplands. Hearth fields are 
                    large areas covered by multiple hearths 1-2 meters (3-7 feet) 
                    across that are often located in gently sloping areas overlooking 
                    drainages and on upland slopes near canyon headers. Ring middens 
                    are donut-shaped piles of fire-cracked limestone rock about 
                    20-30 feet across that formed around a central roasting pit

                  <h3>Culture History</h3>
                  <p class="text">Archeological research in the project area and 
                    surrounding regions has defined the broad outlines of the 
                    culture history of the Lower Pecos. Excavations at deeply 
                    stratified terrace sites and deep rockshelters have yielded 
                    long sequences of distinctive projectile points. Projectile 
                    points are useful as time-markers because point styles changed 
                    through time. The two most important sites in this regard 
                    are the Devils Mouth site, at the junction of the Devils River 
                    and the Rio Grande, and Arenosa Shelter near the junction 
                    of the Pecos River and the Rio Grande. Over 470 radiocarbon 
                    dates have been obtained from these and other Lower Pecos 
                    sites. </p>
                  <p class="text">One of the difficulties in making sense of the 
                    radiocarbon dates is that most have come from rockshelters. 
                    Rockshelter deposits are often very complex because they have 
                    been mixed or churned up over time by common cultural practices 
                    such as pit digging and natural processes such as animal burrowing. 
                    Animals and humans competed for the use of many rockshelters. 
                    The protected overhangs with their soft, ashy cultural deposits 
                    and many organic materials offer attractive habitat for rock 
                    squirrels, pack rats, gophers, skunks, badgers, and other 
                    burrowing and nest-building creatures. As a result, the radiocarbon 
                    dates from the rockshelters have often presented problems 
                    in interpretation&#151;dates that are too young or too old 
                    for the artifacts found nearby.</p>
                  <p class="text">The chronology of the Lower Pecos area has been 
                    divided into the traditional Paleoindian to Historic period 
                    scheme. Subperiods, originally developed by Dave Dibble based 
                    on the Arenosa Shelter sequence, have been further refined 
                    by Turpin based on information about perishable materials, 
                    diet, burial practices, and rock art stylistic changes. Here 
                    we will outline a simplified culture-history sequence, beginning 
                    with the earliest period. We give approximate date ranges 
                    in both calendar years and in radiocarbon years before present 
                    (RCYBP). Note that there is not a direct 
                    linear relationship between calendar years and radiocarbon 
                    years before present. See the Glossary entry for <a href="../glossary/index.html#r" class="text">Radiocarbon 
                    Dating</a> for further explanation.) </p>

                    region are poorly understood. The bones of extinct Ice-Age 
                    animals found in Bone Bed I at Bonfire Shelter are thought 
                    to show evidence of butchering, but no stone tools were documented 
                    from this level. (See <a href="../bonfire/index.html" class="text">Bonfire 
                    Shelter</a> exhibit.) At Cueva Quebrada (&quot;broken cave&quot;), 
                    burned Pleistocene mammal bones with butchering marks were 
                    recovered in association with 10 chipped stone flakes and 
                    a stone adze (Clear Fork tool). Charcoal from the same context 
                    as the burned bone yielded dates ranging between 10,500 and 
                    12,500 B.C. (12,000 to 14,300 RCYBP) The connection between 
                    these early dates and the tools is tenuous, and very early 
                    human occupation (pre-11,500 B.C.) of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands remains 
                    to be confirmed. </p>
                  <p class="text">The presence of humans in the Lower Pecos region 
                    is well documented by 10,000 B.C. In Bone Bed 2 at Bonfire 
                    Shelter, extinct bison bones (possibly <em>Bison antiquus</em>) 
                    were recovered along with Folsom and Plainview points. (Several possible Clovis point fragments hint that Bone Bed 2 began forming even earlier.) These 
                    animals were stampeded over a cliff into the canyon below. 
                    On many of the bones found in the archeological deposits, 
                    butchering marks are clearly visible. <em>Bison antiquus</em> 
                    bones were also recovered from the middle levels of Cueva 
                    Quebrada and the lowest level of Arenosa Shelter, both of 
                    which are roughly contemporaneous with Bone Bed 2.</p>
                  <p class="text">Around 9,500 years ago (7500 B.C.), distinct 
                    changes in the lifeways of Paleoindian groups are reflected 
                    in artifact changes. Dart point styles became more localized 
                    and diverse. Numerous Angostura and Golondrina points, typical 
                    of the late Paleoindian period, have been recovered from the 
                    Lower Pecos Canyonlands. The large animals of the Pleistocene had become 
                    extinct, and the Late Paleoindian economy emphasized smaller 
                    game and more plant foods. This is best illustrated by analysis 
                    of a well-preserved hearth dating to 7000 B.C. in Baker Cave. 
                    The fill of this hearth contained the remains of 16 different 
                    kinds of plants, 11 different mammals, 6 fish, and 18 reptiles. 
                    This diverse assemblage suggests that the area was already 
                    a semiarid savannah with plants that are typical of the modern 
                    environment. </p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Early Archaic (7,000 to 4,000 B.C. or 8500-6000 
                    RCYBP). </b>The combination of a semiarid climate, deep canyons, 
                    and dry rockshelters has created perfect conditions for the 
                    best preserved records of Archaic cultures in North America. 
                    The earliest perishable materials in the Lower Pecos date 
                    to the latter part of the Early Archaic. Both coiled and plaited 
                    basketry and various tool forms &#151;including dart points, 
                    knives, scrapers, manos, metates, and bedrock mortars&#151;have 
                    been documented. Lechuguilla and yucca fiber was used to make 
                    nets, snares, and sandals. The technology of basketry and 
                    sandal manufacture is so similar to that documented at sites 
                    in northern Mexico that it has been suggested that Lower Pecos 
                    groups of the period were closely related to the peoples living 
                    to the south and west in Coahuila.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the Early Archaic, rockshelter occupation 
                    became widespread in the region. At Hinds Cave in Val Verde 
                    County, specialized activity areas were well defined, including 
                    a latrine area, a living floor made of prickly-pear pads, 
                    grass-lined pits, and oven areas surrounded by burned rock 
                    refuse. Dart points characteristic of the period include Early 
                    Corner-Notched, Early Stemmed, and Early Barbed, as well as 
                    Baker and Bandy point types.</p>
                  <p class="text">Two types of mobile art are known from the Early 
                    Archaic&#151;painted pebbles and clay figurines, the latter 
                    rare. Painted pebbles are thought to represent human figures, 
                    usually feminine. Clay figurines have exaggerated female attributes, 
                    but are typically headless. Burial customs during the Early 
                    Archaic are poorly known; however, 21 individuals representing 
                    all age groups and both sexes were recovered from Seminole 
                    Sink, a vertical-shaft cave near Seminole Canyon. </p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Middle Archaic (4000-1500 B.C. or 6000-3000 
                    RCYBP).</b> As populations continued to grow, the people relied 
                    more heavily on small animals and a greater variety of plant 
                    resources. In the Lower Pecos region, the Pandale dart point 
                    is the time marker for the onset of the Middle Archaic. A 
                    definitive characteristic of the Early to Middle Archaic is 
                    the use of earth ovens for plant baking. Evidence from Hinds 
                    Cave documents the use of earth ovens with rock heating elements 
                    to bake lechuguilla (<em>Agave lechuguilla</em>) and sotol (<em>Dasylirion 
                    texanum</em>). This appears to indicate a shift to less-desirable 
                    plant resources requiring more intensive labor input.</p>
                  <p class="text">By 2000 B.C., the localized Archaic culture 
                    of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands was quite distinctive. Population 
                    increase is indicated by higher numbers of both &quot;upland&quot; 
                    and &quot;lowland&quot; sites. This coincides with the appearance 
                    of a complex, polychrome pictographic art form, termed the 
                    Pecos River Style, which is also considered a hallmark of 
                    the Middle Archaic in the Lower Pecos region. These pictographs 
                    depict anthropomorphic (human-like) and animal figures resembling 
                    deer, mountain lions, fishes, birds, humans, and many enigmatic 
                    figures with both human and animal characteristics. The human-like 
                    characters adorned with feathers, wings, and antlers, and 
                    holding plants, atlatls, darts, sticks, and pouches are believed 
                    to have been associated with shamanic rituals, and have been 
                    specifically linked to spiritual transformation of the participants. 
                    Recent formal analyses of Pecos River style rock art sites 
                    have demonstrated that some represent single panels of work 
                    depicting specific types of rituals.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Late Archaic (1500 B.C to A.D. 1000 or 3000-1200 
                    RCYBP).</b> The onset of the Late Archaic in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands 
                    is marked by the return of bison into the region. This seems 
                    to coincide with a wet period as indicated by increases in 
                    pine and grass pollen. The most spectacular archeological 
                    example is Bone Bed 3 at Bonfire Shelter, which contained 
                    the bones of an estimated 800 modern bison (<em>Bison bison</em>). 
                    Bison bones have been identified at other sites in the region 
                    including Eagle Cave, Arenosa Shelter, Castle Canyon, and 
                    Skyline Shelter. The environment of the period has been interpreted 
                    as cooler and wetter, promoting the growth of grasslands which 
                    allowed bison to return to the region. Some have suggested 
                    that plains hunting groups may have migrated into the area 
                    following the buffalo and may be responsible for the Red Linear 
                    rock art style. </p>
                  <p class="text">During the final millennium of the Late Archaic, 
                    the climate apparently returned to a more arid condition, 
                    as is implied by a decrease in grass and tree pollen and by 
                    the disappearance of bison from archeological deposits. The 
                    Flanders subperiod is marked by presence of the Shumla point 
                    type. Turpin maintains that people from the plains of Coahuila 
                    and the surrounding mountains moved into the lower Pecos River 
                    region following the withdrawal of bison hunters.</p>
                  <p class="text">The presence of numerous burned rock middens 
                    both inside and outside rockshelters suggests that the Late 
                    Archaic was a period of intensive plant baking. An analysis 
                    of plant materials from the refuse of a roasting pit in Hinds 
                    Cave identified 35 plant species. Although the heated rock 
                    was primarily used to bake sotol and lechuguilla, other very 
                    important plant resources recovered from the midden context 
                    included prickly pear (tunas and nodes) and mesquite (beans 
                    and seeds). </p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric (A.D 1000 
                    to 1500 or 1300-500 RCYBP).</b> This final prehistoric period 
                    is marked by the appearance of arrow points and the use of 
                    the bow and arrow. In the Lower Pecos, the earliest appearance 
                    of arrow points occurs around 650 B.C (1380 RCYBP) at Arenosa 
                    Shelter. Many well-excavated sites in the region do not contain 
                    Late Prehistoric deposits, either due to changes in settlement 
                    patterns or to destruction of upper deposits by artifact hunters. 
                    Point types typical of the period include a variety of arrow 
                    points including Scallorn, Perdiz, Livermore, and Toyah .</p>
                  <p class="text">The apparent increase in the number of ring- 
                    or crescent-shaped burned rock middens at open sites in upland 
                    settings has been attributed to an intensification of the 
                    use of lechuguilla and sotol. Late Prehistoric burial customs 
                    included flexed interments, cremations, secondary disposal 
                    in vertical-shaft caves, and cairn burials. The Red Monochrome 
                    art style, some examples perhaps depicting bows and arrows, 
                    may be linked to this time period.</p>

                    artifact assemblage is comparable to the Toyah phase of central 
                    and southern Texas, and is interpreted as representing an 
                    influx of outsiders coinciding with the return of bison during 
                    a wetter period known as the Little Ice Age in Protohistoric 
                    and early Historic times. Age estimates for the Infierno phase 
                    of A.D. 1500-1780 are based on comparisons with other regions, 
                    not on radiocarbon dates. The Infierno phase may represent, 
                    as some have argued, a very late, intrusive Protohistoric 
                    Plains culture such as that of the Apache or, alternatively, 
                    it may simply be a late variant of the Toyah culture in the 
                    Lower Pecos region.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Historic (500 RCYBP-Present).</b> In 1590, 
                    Casta&ntilde;o de Sosa was the first European to traverse 
                    the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. Spanish accounts often 
                    describe the region as uninhabited; however, illegal slaving 
                    expeditions that preceded de Sosa's expedition may have encouraged 
                    the Indians to avoid all contact with Europeans. A major factor 
                    influencing our understanding of historic native populations 
                    of the region is that frequently, the historically documented 
                    groups ranged into southern and central Texas as well as the 
                    Lower Pecos Canyonlands. Historic Indian groups were widely displaced 
                    by the expansion of the Spanish frontier from the south and 
                    by intrusions of Apache, Comanche, and their allies from the 
                    north and west. European and Anglo-American settlement of 
                    the Lower Pecos did not take hold until the mid to late nineteenth 
                    century.</p>
