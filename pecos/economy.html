                          a time consuming process. The beans must be gathered

				  <p class="text">The basic economy of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands  throughout the prehistoric era was hunting and gathering 
                    (also called foraging). Although hunting may have been the 
                    emphasis during intervals when bison were present in the region, 
                    as the Bonfire Shelter example clearly shows, plants probably 
                    played a much greater role in the day-to-day survival. The 
                    rich archeological record of the region has provided much 
                    data for the reconstruction of prehistoric hunter-gatherer 
                    economy in the region. The economy of the Archaic period has 
                    been studied through the analysis of many different kinds 
                    of materials including animal bones, plant remains, coprolites, 
                    and human skeletal remains. </p>
                  <p class="text">What we think of as the characteristic Archaic 
                    economy of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands began developing at least as early 
                    as the Late Paleoindian period. This is well illustrated by 
                    analysis of a well-preserved hearth dating to 7000 B.C. in 
                    Baker Cave. The fill of this hearth contained the remains 
                    of 16 different kinds of plants, 11 different mammals (most 
                    of them rodents), 6 fish, and 18 reptiles. This diverse assemblage 
                    suggests that people were foraging widely and making use of 
                    practically any creature that moved as well as many plants.</p>
                  <p class="text">By 4,000 B.C., if not sooner, agave, yucca, 
                    sotol, and prickly pear were used as staples, particularly 
                    during times of subsistence stress. These were prepared in 
                    earth ovens, the remains of which dominate the archeological 
                    record. Nonetheless, the diet was highly varied and included 
                    other plants, small and large mammals, reptiles, and fish. 
                    Because large game, if available, provides more meat than 
                    small game, one would expect evidence of large game (deer, 
                    pronghorn, and bison) in well-preserved habitation sites in 
                    the region. In fact, a sizable sample of bones from Hinds 
                    Cave revealed that rodents and rabbits provided most of the 
                    protein. In the Early Archaic burials from Seminole Sink, 
                    the largest single regional burial population studied to date, 
                    there was a high incidence of dental cavities, the result 
                    of a diet very high in carbohydrates. These individuals had 
                    even worse teeth than those of later agricultural peoples 
                    elsewhere in North America who relied heavily on corn. Basically, 
                    their teeth were rotten by early adulthood. Their bones also 
                    indicate dietary trouble including severe stress caused by 
                    periods of near starvation. </p>
                  <p class="text">Recent experimental studies and botanical analyses 
                    of earth ovens have demonstrated that Archaic period earth 
                    ovens in the Lower Pecos region would have yielded only modest 
                    quantities of food (as measured by calories) compared to the 
                    amount of labor required. Furthermore, intensive reliance 
                    on plant baking would have led to the quick depletion of local 
                    lechuguilla and sotol fields, and the large quantities of 
                    wood needed to fire the ovens would have exhausted local fuel 
                    supplies. The tremendous amount of refuse generated by lechuguilla 
                    and sotol processing in earth ovens created the impression 
                    of an economy driven by plant resources that in reality do 
                    not produce that many calories. The overwhelming archeological 
                    visibility of earth-oven debris may have led archeologists 
                    to overestimate group size and length of stay, and to underestimate 
                    the degree of mobility.</p>
                  <p class="text">Nonetheless, the remains of earth ovens are 
                    found in almost every prehistoric archeological site in the 
                    region. A special exhibit on earth oven cooking is being planned 
                    for <em>Texas Beyond History. </em>In the meantime, here is 
                    a quick review. All sorts of archeological terms have been 
                    applied to earth ovens and their residue including roasting 
                    pits, baking pits, sotol pits, mescal pits, ring middens, 
                    crescent middens, burned rock middens, pit hearths, and large 
                    hearths. In essence, these are all the result of earth oven 
                    cooking. Here is how it works.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Earth ovens</b> have been used all over the 
                    world, in the past and even today. Although there are many 
                    variations, the basic theme is the same. First a pit is dug. 
                    Then wood is added and a fire is started. Rocks are placed 
                    atop and amid the fuel. When the rocks are hot and most of 
                    the fuel is consumed, the rocks are arranged (using long poles) 
                    to form a flat or bowl-shaped &quot;oven bed&quot; (or hot 
                    rock bed). The hot rocks form a &quot;heating element&quot; 
                    which will hold and release heat for lengthy periods. The 
                    first thing placed on top of rocks is a thick layer of green 
                    plants such as green grass or prickly pear pads. This layer 
                    does two things: it keeps the food from burning and it provides 
                    the moisture needed for steam heating. Next, the food is added. 
                    In the Lower Pecos Canyonlands this often meant the trimmed hearts or 
                    bulbs of lechugilla and sotol. The food is covered by another 
                    green layer, providing more moisture and also keeping the 
                    food clean. Finally, a thick layer of earth is added that 
                    seals in the moist heat. A properly constructed earth oven 
                    will keep a temperature of right at 100&ordm; C (boiling temperature) 
                    for many hours. After a long cooling period during which the 
                    heated plants continue to cook, the earth oven is opened. 
                    The total cooking time can be up to three days.</p>

                          plants in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. Its tough fibers were the 
                          preferred material for making sandals, mats, baskets, 
                          and many other items. Its heart or leaf base was a major 
                          carbohydrate source. Large quantities of lechuguilla 
                          hearts were baked in earth ovens. Recent work has shown 
                          that lechuguilla yields more food than the same amount 
                          of sotol, but that both plants require a tremendous 
                          amount of labor for the return in calories. In other 
                          words, people must have eaten these plants only when
