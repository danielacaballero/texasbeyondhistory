				  <p class="text">Much of what we know about the ancient peoples 
                    who lived in the Lower Pecos comes from rockshelters, places 
                    where people sometimes lived and carried out both the mundane 
                    and the sacred aspects of life. This section presents numerous 
                    pictures of Lower Pecos rockshelters, explains rockshelter 
                    basics, and introduces some of the better-known shelters. 
                  </p>
                  <h3><a name="what"></a>What are rockshelters and how do they 
                    form?</h3>
                  <p class="text">Rockshelters (or just shelters) are natural 
                    overhangs or shallow caves that form on cliff faces and other 
                    steep rocky exposures. They can form through wind erosion, 
                    water erosion, and the dissolution of soft layers of rock. 
                    Technically, rockshelters are wider than they are deep and 
                    caves are deeper than they are wide, but this distinction 
                    is frequently ignored. Many rockshelters are called caves 
                    and we tend to use whatever name has stuck. The prehistoric 
                    peoples of the Lower Pecos did make limited use of some true 
                    caves also, but most caves in the area are not readily accessible 
                    and are often very narrow, underground places ill suited for 
                    human occupation. Rockshelters, on the other hand, often furnished 
                    quite comfortable living quarters&#151;big rooms with a view.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Lower Pecos contains hundreds of rockshelters. 
                    They are common in the region for two reasons. First, the 
                    right kind of rock&#151;the area is part of a enormous expanse 
                    of limestone called the Edwards Plateau that extends all across 
                    the Texas Hill Country and beyond. Second, the vast network 
                    of canyons provides the vertical rock faces needed for rockshelters 
                    to form. The process of rockshelter formation can be complex 
                    and it differs from spot to spot depending on such factors 
                    as the direction the cliff faces, the prevailing wind direction, 
                    the hardness of each rock formation, the distance to the nearest 
                    stream, and so on. It is a continuous process that happens 
                    on a geological time scale. As you read this, new rockshelters 
                    are forming ever so slowly and old ones are crumbling. But 
                    most take thousands of years to form, so you might not want 
                    to wait around to watch. If you could, here is what you would 
                    see.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the Lower Pecos, rockshelters often form 
                    in places where a layer of softer rock is sandwiched between 
                    two harder layers. Because the softer materials erode faster 
                    when exposed to the natural elements (wind, sun, and water), 
                    a hollow begins to form. The hard layer above becomes the 
                    roof of the rockshelter and the hard layer below becomes its 
                    floor. As the back of the shelter and its roof weathers, &quot;spalls&quot; 
                    or chunks of rock break off and fall to the floor of the shelter. 
                    In cold wet winter weather, the process speeds up. Moisture 
                    in cracks in the wall or roof expands when frozen and then 
                    contracts when thawed. This cycle&#151;expand, contract, expand, 
                    contract&#151;causes more spalls to break off from the roof 
                    and wall and the rockshelter becomes larger and deeper. Eventually, 
                    the hard layer that forms the roof becomes undercut too much 
                    by the deepening shelter and the whole layer may collapse, 
                    destroying the rockshelter.</p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the rockshelter formation process actually 
                    occurs at a microscopic level&#151;tiny particles of rock 
                    constantly trickle down, faster in soft rock, slower in hard 
                    rock. These tiny particles form &quot;cave dust&quot;&#151;a 
                    fine off-white powder resembling unbleached flour. The spalls 
                    and cave dust fall to the floor of the rockshelter. What happens 
                    next depends on where the rockshelter is located and whether 
                    its floor is flat or sloping. Some shelters have floors that 
                    are steeply sloped outward such that anything falling on the 
                    floor quickly tumbles to the canyon floor. Other rockshelters 
                    have more or less flat floors and as roof spalls and cave 
                    dust falls, it accumulates on the floor. Unless, that is, 
                    the rockshelter is located at the base of a cliff beside a 
                    stream, where anything resting on the floor is periodically 
                    scoured out by floodwater.</p>
                  <p class="text">Now for the part that draws the archeologist&#151;the 
                    stuff inside the rockshelters and on the walls. Many of the 
                    occupied rockshelters in the Lower Pecos have more or less 
                    flat floors and are located high above flood level. In these 
                    places, the rockshelters slowly fill up with deposits of natural 
                    materials&#151; roof spalls and cave dust, mixed with cultural 
                    materials&#151;anything humans make or bring in. And people 
                    living in rockshelters hauled in plants, tools, tool-making 
                    materials, containers, food, rocks, firewood, and more. Over 
                    time, some rockshelter deposits have grown to over 30 feet 
                    thick just during the time span that humans lived in the region 
                    (the last 13,000 years or so). Archeologists get excited when 
                    we excavate rockshelters because we often find well-preserved 
                    organic materials (see below) and as we peel back the layers, 
                    one by one, evidence comes to light from earlier and earlier 
                    periods of time. That, and the fact that the shelter walls 
                    are often covered with bright multi-colored pictographs depicting 
                    animals, humans, and many symbols whose meaning is not obvious. 
                  </p>
                  <h3><a name="why"></a>Why were some rockshelters occupied and 
                    not others?</h3>
                  <p class="text">As the photographs in this section show, no 
                    two rockshelters are the same. Some are much larger than others, 
                    some occur at the bottom of a cliff, others at the top, and 
                    so on. In general, people, of course, chose to live in the 
                    larger ones located near areas where water, food sources, 
                    and other basic necessities were readily available. They favored 
                    those with flat floors and those that faced in certain directions. 
                    And this would have changed from season to season. For example, 
                    in the hot summer, a rockshelter that faces (opens toward) 
                    the west and the setting sun is not a very comfortable place 
                    to be. Similarly, in the winter, shelters facing north are 
                    much colder and windier than those facing south. This probably 
                    explains why the rockshelters with the most abundant evidence 
                    of occupation are those that face east or south.</p>
                  <p class="text">We know which rockshelters were favorite places 
                    to stay because they are full of evidence of daily life&#151;trash, 
                    mostly. And in the rockshelters of the Lower Pecos the trash 
                    contains all sorts of organic materials that are not preserved 
                    in most archeological sites. Dried plants, fibers, seeds, 
                    nuts, leaves, roots, sticks, bone, leather, wood, and all 
                    kinds of things made out of these materials. Baskets, mats, 
                    ropes, nets, blankets, robes, digging sticks, atlatls, darts, 
                    fire-drills, snares, pouches, sandals, and many more &quot;perishable&quot; 
                    artifacts. We also find cooking pits, grass beds, latrines, 
                    warmth hearths, and other kinds of features. Such things can 
                    last for 5,000 to 6,000 years in the right environment. In 
                    the Lower Pecos this means a well-protected rockshelter that 
                    stays dry.</p>
                  <p class="text">One of the things that people routinely did 
                    in certain rockshelters was to cook plant foods&#151;roots 
                    and bulbs mostly&#151;in large cooking pits called roasting 
                    pits or earth ovens. Earth ovens are layered arrangements 
                    of heated rocks, plants, food, and earth that roast or bake 
                    food slowly&#151;often over 2-3 days time. Not just any food, 
                    but mainly root foods like the hearts (bulbs) of the lechuguilla 
                    and sotol plants&#151;inedible raw, after prolonged cooking 
                    they turn to a sugary carbohydrate. Most earth ovens were 
                    constructed outside in open sites archeologically identified 
                    as burned rock middens&#151;piles of fire-cracked rock that 
                    accumulated around roasting pits. But in the Lower Pecos, 
                    earth ovens were also built inside certain rockshelters. Why? 
                    The most likely explanation is the shelters mainly were used 
                    for cooking during periods of wet or very cold weather when 
                    earth ovens would be difficult to build in the open. </p>
                  <p class="text">Other shelters weren't used for everyday living 
                    or cooking, but for special purposes. For example, there are 
                    a series of shallow rockshelters located almost at the top 
                    of an enormous cliff overlooking the Devils River. Most of 
                    these are small and they have steep floors where nothing rests 
                    for long. While these were useless as places to live, their 
                    walls are covered with rock art. These were obviously special, 
                    sacred places where rituals took place or were at least evoked 
                    by the painted symbols such as that of a panther with an unnatural 
                    &quot;curly&quot; tail. </p>
                  <p class="text">When you visit one of these hard-to-reach places 
                    high above the canyons, the view is spectacular and awe-inspiring. 
                    It doesn't take much imagination to conjure up the &quot;vision 
                    quests&quot; and other extraordinary experiences that small 
                    groups of prehistoric peoples took part in there. While we'll 
                    never know the details, we can see patterns in the location 
                    of such places, the types of associated symbols, and sometimes 
                    artifacts. </p>
                  <p class="text">Another type of special purpose rockshelter 
                    is that used for human burials. Sometimes burials are found 
                    in ordinary rockshelters full of evidence of everyday life. 
                    The burials are usually placed in the backs of the shelters 
                    or in small chambers or other out-of-the-way places. In other 
                    cases, people sought out small, remote shelters and crevices 
                    as burial places, perhaps in hopes these would not be disturbed.

                  <h3><a name="lp"></a>Lower Pecos Rockshelters </h3>
                  <p class="text"><b>Fate Bell Shelter</b> was one of the first 
                    rockshelters in the Lower Pecos to be excavated by a professional 
                    archeologist. A.T. Jackson carried out relatively modest excavations 
                    there in 1932 on behalf of the University of Texas and its 
                    archeological leader, Professor James E. Pearce. His excavation 
                    report was the first reasonably detailed description of a 
                    rockshelter. Several years later he published a study called 
                    <em>Picture Writing of Texas Indians </em>that described the 
                    pictographs found at Fate Bell and dozens of other localities 
                    in the Lower Pecos and elsewhere in Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">Fate Bell Shelter is massive, stretching over 
                    150 yards from one &quot;end&quot; to the other, but narrow, 
                    only 40 feet or so at its widest point. It was used as an 
                    habitation site, a cooking place, a burial place, and as a 
                    rock art gallery. The thick deposits once contained a wealth 
                    of information, but, sadly, most of the cave was dug up by 
                    untrained people intent on finding showy artifacts. In the 
                    1970s the property became part of Seminole Canyon State Park 
                    and the site is now protected by law. Visitors to the park 
                    can take special guided tours of Fate Bell Shelter, an unforgettable 
                    experience.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Hinds Cave</b>, located in a side canyon 
                    off the Pecos River, is one of the most carefully studied 
                    rockshelters. It was excavated in the 1970s by archeologists 
                    from Texas A&amp;M. They were particularly interested in human 
                    ecology&#151;how people interact with the environment. Professors 
                    and graduate students undertook many different kinds of specialized 
                    studies. One of the most informative types of research was 
                    coprolite analysis. Coprolites are dried human feces&#151;when 
                    &quot;reconstituted&quot; by adding water, even 4,000-year-old 
                    specimens smell just like the original. This may be more than 
                    you wanted to know, but coprolite analysis gives a direct 
                    picture of the ancient human diet. You won't be shocked to 
                    learn that it was the graduate students who were assigned 
                    analyze the coprolites.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Baker Cave</b> is on a small side canyon 
                    off the Devils River. It, too, has been carefully studied 
                    by several different projects. One of the most astonishing 
                    findings there was a large cooking hearth that dates to about 
                    9,000 years old during what is often called the Late Paleoindian 
                    period. The hearth was chock full of bones, but not the bones 
                    of bison or other large animals. Instead, there were snakes, 
                    rats, fish, rabbits, and many other small creatures as well 
                    as various charred seeds and nuts. This shows that by this 
                    time people were already making use of virtually everything 
                    that was edible. </p>

                    It is famed because it was the scene of a series of buffalo 
                    &quot;jumps&quot; beginning as early as 12,000 years ago or

                    shelter situated on a cliff overlooking the Rio Grande at 
                    the mouth of Seminole Canyon. This cave is known for its spectacular 
                    rock art, especially a huge red panther (mountain lion). This 
                    site lies within the boundaries of the Amistad National Recreation

                    narrow rockshelter that is important because of the archeological 
                    excavations done there in 1962. According to archeologist 
                    Ed Jelks who supervised the Amistad Reservoir investigations, 
                    the shelter takes its name from the local nickname for the 
                    western diamondback rattlesnake&#151;coontail&#151;the dark 
                    bands around the snake's tail are reminiscent of a coon's

                    Coontail Spin Cave. The results of work at this site will

                    because of the evocative image of &#133; you guessed it, a 
                    white shaman. Actually, the &quot;white shaman&quot; is an 
                    anthropomorphic figure of the type called &quot;shamans,&quot; 
                    but the meaning of these figures is debated. (See<a href="art.html" class="text">

                          symbolic importance as openings to the underworld. The 
                          deceased was lowered into the narrow sinkhole opening 
                          perhaps with the idea that in doing so, he or she could 
                          join ancestors in the world beyond the living face of 
                          the earth. Mural by Nola Davis, courtesy of the Texas

                          may look like the result of mining, but this is actually

                          of the use of this shelter for earth oven cooking on 
                          countless occasions. For scale, the opening of this 
                          shelter is about 10-12 feet high and perhaps 50 feet

                          It was partially excavated by A.T. Jackson in 1932 and 
                          briefly tested by Mark Parsons in 1963. In between and 
                          afterward, much of the cave was churned up by looters. 
                          The walls of the shelter are covered with hundreds of 
                          pictographs. Today this shelter is protected within
