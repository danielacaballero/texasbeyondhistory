                  <p class="text">Here we will simply provide some examples illustrating 
                    the diversity of the imagery and the kinds of physical contexts 
                    within which Lower Pecos rock art occurs. A few quick points:</p>
                  <p class="text">&quot;Rock art&quot; includes more than just 
                    <b>pictographs</b>&#151;painted images. <b>Petroglyphs</b>&#151;carved, 
                    pecked, or incised images&#151;also occur in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. 
                    So do various kinds of mobile art including <b>painted pebbles</b>.                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Pictographs are the most numerous and best known 
                    rock art images in the Lower Pecos. Four main styles were 
                    defined by W.W. Newcomb. From oldest to most recent these 
                    are: <b>Pecos River</b>, <b><b>Red Linear</b>, Red Monochrome</b>, 
                    and <b>Historic</b>. The oldest, the Pecos River style, is 
                    also the most common, most complex, and most carefully studied.                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Many of the Pecos River pictographs are widely 
                    regarded as expressions of shamanistic ritual. As summarized 
                    by Carolyn Boyd and Phil Dering in a 1996 article:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p class="text"><em>Shamans are found primarily within Native 
                      American societies that rely heavily on hunting and gathering 
                      or fishing &#133; In these societies, the shaman serves 
                      a crucial role as diviner, seer, magician, healer of bodily 
                      and spiritual ills, keeper of traditions, and artist. Acting 
                      as the guardian of the physical and psychic equilibrium 
                      of the society, the shaman, through altered states of consciousness, 
                      journeys to the spirit world where he will personally confront 
                      the supernatural forces on behalf of his group.&#133; Access 
                      to the spirit or Otherworld can be achieved through such 
                      methods as the use of hallucinogenic or psychoactive plants, 
                      fasting, thirsting, blood-letting, self-hypnosis and various 
                      types of rhythmic activities &#133;.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">As the article documents, there is clear evidence 
                    of hallucinogenic plants including peyote, mountain laurel 
                    beans (seeds), and datura (jimson weed) in the rock art and 
                    cave deposits of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. </p>
                  <p class="text">Controversy has arisen concerning 
                    the specter of prehistoric &quot;drug&quot; use, despite ample 
                    evidence of the ritual and medicinal importance of such psychoactive 
                    plants in many Indian cultures in the New World. Politically 
                    correct or not, the use of these plants was part and parcel 
                    of shamanistic ritual in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands as elsewhere in the 
                    hunter-gatherer world. While ingesting psychoactive plants 
                    can be very dangerous and even fatal, they obviously played 
                    a critical role in certain of the rituals depicted in the 
                    Lower Pecos rock art. The ritual use of peyote continues today 
                    by members of the Native American Church, a traditional religious 
                    practice that has been ruled constitutionally protected by 
                    the United States Supreme Court.</p>
                  <p class="text">The rock art of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands dates to at 
                    least 4,500 years ago and possibly considerably earlier. Within 
                    the past decade or so, chemist Marvin Rowe at Texas A&amp;M 
                    and researchers at other institutions have devised clever 
                    ways of directly dating elements of the paint. As this research 
                    matures, dating will become an important tool in understanding 
                    the evolution and meaning of rock art in the region. </p>
                  <p class="text">The most comprehensive catalogue of Lower Pecos 
                    rock art is still the work of Dallas artist Forest Kirkland 
                    who with his wife and partner, Lula, visited dozens of rock 
                    art localities across the western half of Texas in the 1930s. 
                    His watercolor renditions of what they observed are often 
                    the sole surviving record of images that have since been destroyed 
                    by time, &quot;progress,&quot; and thoughtless vandals. Shortly 
                    after Kirkland first laid eyes on Indian pictographs in the 
                    summer of 1933 at Paint Rock near San Angelo, he dedicated 
                    almost every available moment to saving these fragile, disappearing 
                    images for posterity. Until he died in 1941, the Kirklands 
                    took extended camping and working vacation trips each summer 
                    to remote places in different parts of Texas where rock art 
                    was known to occur, including the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Kirklands took a systematic approach to 
                    their work, capturing each grouping of paintings they could 
                    make out on panels of high quality English linen mounted on 
                    heavy cardboard plates. All drawings were done to scale and 
                    were considered &quot;copies&quot; as faithful to the original 
                    as possible. The story of the Kirklands' work and most of 
                    his drawings appear in the 1967 book <em>The Rock Art of Texas 
                    Indians</em> (text by W.W. Newcomb), reissued in 1996 by UT 
                    Press. You learn more about Kirkland's work and see many examples 
					of his renderings  elsewhere on this website&#8212;see <a href="../plateaus/artistic/trail.html">On the Trail to Lower Pecos Rock Art</a>.</p>
                  <p class="text">The two leading researchers who study Lower 
                    Pecos rock art today are Dr. Solveig Turpin and Dr. Carolyn 
                    Boyd. Their approaches and interpretations vary considerably.                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Turpin, an archeologist by training and former 
                    Associate Director of TARL, has been at it for a lot longer 
                    and takes a more traditional approach to her work. She has 
                    published numerous scholarly articles and book chapters documenting 
                    and interpreting many different aspects of Lower Pecos rock 
                    art including work in northern Coahuila. She also co-authored 
                    and edited several rock art volumes including a beautifully 
                    illustrated coffee-table book entitled <em>Pecos River Rock 
                    Art </em>(with Jim Zintgraff, the leading rock art photographer 
                    of the region). Turpin and Zintgraff are co-founders of the 
                    <a href="http://www.rockart.org/" target="_blank" class="text">Rock 
                    Art Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization devoted to the 
                    preservation and study of rock art.</p>
                  <p class="text">Boyd, an artist and anthropologist by training 
                    and has pioneered what she calls an ethnographic approach to Lower Pecos rock 
                    art interpretation. She argues that many rock art panels represent 
                    coherent mural-like compositions rather than randomly added 
                    elements as many have assumed. She sees many parallels between 
                    the Pecos River style symbolism and that expressed in the 
                    mythology and belief systems of many living and historically 
                    known cultures in Mexico and the Southwest. Boyd has published 
                    several scholarly articles and book chapters on her work and 
                    has just finished a book that has been published by Texas A&amp;M
                    Press. She is the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.shumla.org/index.htm" target="_blank">Shumla School</a>, a non-profit educational and research center located on  the lower Pecos River. Today Boyd and her  collaborators and students continue studying and documenting the rock art of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands.</p>
                  <p class="text">Another important group actively involved in 
                     research is the Rock Art Recording Task Force 
                    of the <a href="http://www.txarch.org/index.html" target="_blank">Texas Archeological Society</a>. The Task Force is devoted to documenting the rock 
                    art of Texas. Each year they concentrate on different localities 
                    and thoroughly record rock art imagery through photography, 
                    mapping, tracing, and illustration, carrying on the work started 
                    by the Kirklands.</p>
