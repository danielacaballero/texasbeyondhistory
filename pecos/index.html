				  <p class="text">The Lower Pecos Canyonlands is one of the most distinctive 
                    and significant archeological regions in Texas and, indeed, in North America. It is not 
                    that the Indians who once lived here were particularly important or unusual&#151;they 
                    were just ordinary folk like many others all across the prehistoric landscape. But due to a unique combination of ecological and geological 
                     factors, the jagged canyonlands they called 
                    home contain an exceptionally rich cultural legacy of ordinary 
                    and extraordinary things that are rarely found in most other 
                    areas of North America&#151;perfectly preserved food remains, 
                    vivid rock art over 4,000 years old, grass-lined beds, painted 
                    deer bones, and much more. By studying these things and the 
                    places where they are found, researchers from many disciplines&#151;archeologists, 
                    anthropologists, biologists, art historians, paleontologists, 
                    geologists, and others&#151;are piecing together a remarkably 
                    detailed understanding of the human and natural past. </p>
                  <p class="text">Although the Lower Pecos Canyonlands contains a uniquely 
                    vital cultural legacy of worldwide importance, many Texans 
                    don't even know it exists. Sadly, among those who do are some 
                    who rip apart its caves out of greed and stupidity and crudely 
                    carve their names on ancient works of art. Those who explore 
                    this exhibit will understand how senseless and tragic these 
                    thoughtless actions are. Perhaps as more people appreciate 
                    what can be learned about the cultural heritage of Texas in 
                    this unparalleled place, the sites that remain unharmed will 
                    be protected for the future.</p>
                  
                  <p class="text">This exhibit provides an overview of the Lower Pecos Canyolands and introduces some 
                    of the places and topics that are explored in greater depth in 
                    three other  companion exhibits on this website. A special exhibit&#8212;<a href="../ethnobot/index.html">Ethnobotany of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands</a>&#8212;details the many ways that native peoples made use of the region's  wild plants. Major  exhibits on two of the 
                    most amazing and best known archeological sites in the Lower 
                    Pecos&#151;<a href="../bonfire/index.html">Bonfire Shelter</a> and <a href="../hinds/index.html">Hinds Cave</a> &#151;illustrate  what can be and has been learned by 
                    thoughtful study.</p>
                  
                  <h3> Lower Pecos Canyonlands  </h3>
                  <p class="text">Here we choose  to use the evocative term &quot;Lower Pecos Canyonlands&quot; or simply the &quot;Lower Pecos&quot; instead of the technical term often favored by archeologists: the &quot;Lower Pecos archeological region.&quot; Archeological regions (sometimes called &quot;cultural areas&quot;) are geographic areas that are distinct 
                    in the minds of archeologists because of the similarities 
                    they observe in culture, artifacts, geography, climate, and other interwoven 
                    factors. In some areas of the state, archeological regions 
                    are very broad and cover many hundreds of square miles&#151;the 
                    Caddo area, for example, covers much of northeast Texas and 
                    adjacent areas of neighboring states (see <a href="../tejas/map/index.html">Caddo Map Tool</a>). In contrast, the Lower 
                    Pecos Canyonlands covers a much smaller territory&#151;the 
                    area surrounding the junctions of the Pecos and Devils Rivers 
                    with the Rio Grande just upstream from Del Rio, Texas. Although 
                    the best-known part of this area lies in Texas, the archeological region extends southward into northern 
                    Coahuila, Mexico.</p>
                  <p class="text">The three rivers and their many tributaries form 
                    deeply incised canyons within which numerous rockshelters 
                    occur. Although the region is arid, averaging less than 15 
                    inches of rain per year, the rivers as well as springs and 
                    temporary waterholes called <em>tinajas</em> within the smaller 
                    canyons provided reliable water sources. For over 13,000 years 
                    prehistoric hunter-gatherers lived in the region, sometimes 
                    occupying the rockshelters. The generally dry conditions coupled 
                    with the protected rockshelters resulted in the preservation 
                    of fragile materials such as wooden artifacts, woven sandals, 
                    and plant food refuse that decay quickly in most other areas 
                    of Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">But the most spectacular and defining archeological 
                    phenomenon in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands is the vivid rock art that adorns 
                    the protected walls of many of the rockshelters. The red, 
                    black, white, and yellow images created by hunter-gatherers 
                    in the Lower Pecos beginning as early as 5,500 years ago are 
                    among the best preserved examples of rock art anywhere in the world. The 
                    art and archeology of the region is truly world class, 
                    providing archeologists with the opportunity to study the 
                    remains of prehistoric gathering and hunting cultures in far 
                    greater detail than is possible elsewhere in Texas and in 
                    much of the world. </p>
                  <h3>In this Exhibit</h3>
                  <p class="text">The <a href="natural.html" class="text">Natural 
                    World</a> of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands is a curious place where permanent 
                    sources of water can be found a short walk from an arid landscape 
                    that may wait months or even years between periods of adequate 
                    rain. Each of the rivers&#151;the Pecos,  the 
                    Rio Grande, and the Devils&#151;originate beyond, sometimes far, far, beyond 
                    the region, giving each a distinct character. Yet the rivers 
                    and their tributaries  form narrow ribbons of oasis-like 
                    abundance that twist and turn through the rocky and often 
                    waterless limestone terrain of the canyonlands. Many of the plants and animals 
                    found here are at the outward limits of their distributions&#151;the 
                    Lower Pecos lies at the intersection of ecological zones stretching 
                    north, east, south, and west.</p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the evidence we have about the human 
                    past in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands comes from <a href="rockshelters.html" class="text">Rockshelters</a>, 
                    natural shelters large and small that occur in great numbers 
                    within the rocky canyonlands of the region. Although it might 
                    seem that way, the prehistoric inhabitants of the region did 
                    not spend most of their lives in rockshelters. They lived 
                    throughout the canyons and high above in the uplands where 
                    grasslands once thrived. But, the rockshelters provided refuge 
                    during times of harsh weather and, more importantly for archeologists, 
                    the rockshelters protected the fragile remains left by prehistoric 
                    peoples from the ravages of time. </p>
                  <p class="text">Above all else, the <a href="art.html" class="text">Rock 
                    Art</a> of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands is its most distinctive and defining 
                    feature. The rockshelters and other protected rock surfaces 
                    provided the canvases upon which prehistoric and early historic-period 
                    Indian artists created some of the world's most remarkable 
                    &quot;primitive art.&quot; While the cultures that produced 
                    the paintings and carvings may be considered primitive at 
                    least in a technological sense, the rock art is incredibly 
                    sophisticated and complex. Hundreds of different motifs and 
                    symbols occur representing at least four major styles, the 
                    earliest and best known of which, the Pecos River style, began 
                    perhaps 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.</p>
                  <p class="text">The hunting and gathering <a href="economy.html" class="text">Economy</a> 
                    of the prehistoric peoples of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands can be studied 
                    in great detail due to the extraordinary preservation conditions. 
                    During most periods, plant gathering played a far more important 
                    role in the day-to-day diet than did hunting. While deer and 
                    buffalo were hunted whenever present, most game was rabbit-sized 
                    and smaller. Two mainstay plants were lechugilla and sotol, 
                    two tough desert plants that have hearts (leaf bases) that 
                    are edible, but only after prolonged cooking. Such plants 
                    may not have been considered very  desirable because they require an extraordinary 
                    amount of labor relative to the food yield. The fact that 
                    these plants were so important to the economy shows how difficult 
                    life could be, especially during droughts and other times 
                    of stress when few options were available.</p>
                  <p class="text">Archeological excavations at more than a dozen 
                    rockshelters in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands have uncovered all sorts of 
                    <a href="everyday.html" class="text">Everyday, Extraordinary 
                    Things</a>&#151;trash, tools, food remains, medicine bundles, 
                    clothing and more. While many of these would have been ordinary, 
                    everyday things in the lives of the prehistoric Indians of 
                    the region, they are quite extraordinary in a different way. 
                    Most of them are made of fragile organic materials&#151;wood 
                    and fiber&#151;that are quickly destroyed through the passage of 
                    time in most places in Texas. Only in dry protected places 
                    (or in permanently waterlogged circumstances) are such everyday 
                    things preserved. Due to its unique setting, the Lower Pecos 
                    has yielded a wealth of such things and they shed much light 
                    on the prehistoric past.</p>
                  <p class="text">Ironically, the<a href="archeology.html" class="text"> 
                    Archeology</a> of Lower Pecos Canyonlands is  less developed than 
                    that of many other areas of Texas despite its obvious importance 
                    and potential. To be sure, much has been learned, but there 
                    is still a great deal more research that is needed including 
                    further digging and further study of the evidence that already 
                    has been recovered. The first archeological expeditions in 
                    the 1930s were mounted by museums intent on gaining fascinating 
                    materials for display. It was not until the late 1950s and 
                    early 1960s that serious research began, most of it prompted 
                    by the construction of a huge dam on the Rio Grande that flooded 
                    out the lower canyons of the Devils and Pecos Rivers.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <a href="before.html" class="text">Before Amistad</a> section tells the story of the archeological and paleoenviromental research that took place in advance of the completion of Amistad Reservoir. This international reservior occuppies the core area of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. The fieldwork began in 1958 and continued until 1969 when the lake began to fill. The analyses and reporting continued into the 1970s and the collections and information from the Amistad research continue to be studied today. </p>
