                  <h3>Massacre or Victory?</h3>
				  <p class="text">Spain and Mexico viewed the attack on Mission 
                    San Sab&aacute; as an atrocity. This is certainly the view 
                    that has come down to us through history books, almost all 
                    of which refer to the attack as a &quot;massacre.&quot; From 
                    the standpoint of the Native American groups involved on the 
                    winning side of the mission attack, it was one of the few 
                    major victories they could claim over the Spanish foreigners 
                    who invaded their land. </p>
                  <p class="text">In addition to being angered by Spanish intrusion, 
                    the Comanches and their allies detested the Apache. This animosity 
                    was the result of earlier competition for land and resources, 
                    at which the aggressive Apache had been very successful. As 
                    the Comanche swept into Texas from the northwest, they found 
                    willing allies in the Wichita, Tonkawa, and other tribes who 
                    had been bullied by the Apache. When the Spaniards chose to 
                    establish a mission for the Apache at San Sab&aacute;, they 
                    automatically became the enemies of the Comanche and other 
                    &quot;Norte&ntilde;o&quot; groups who detested the Apache.</p>
                  <p class="text">The destruction of the mission and subsequent 
                    harassment of Spaniards still occupying the Presidio San Sab&aacute; 
                    were major reasons for the eventual withdrawal of the Spaniards 
                    out of Texas, and guaranteed Indian domination of much of 
                    the region for another 50 to 100 years. Strategically, the 
                    attack on Mission San Sab&aacute; was as successful as the 
                    Spanish decision to establish the mission was a failure.</p>
                  <h3>&quot;A Triumph For All Who Seek&quot;</h3>
                  <p class="text">Mark Wolf, Kay Hindes, and I realize we were 
                    very fortunate to have found Mission San Sab&aacute;. Many 
                    very capable people had previously searched long and hard 
                    but had failed to find the mission. We had two advantages 
                    going for us. First, Hindes had an open mind about what John 
                    Warren Hunter had to say. It is a lesson to all of us that 
                    &quot;no stone should be left unturned&quot; in the search 
                    for elusive sites like San Sab&aacute;. Secondly, it was just 
                    a plain stroke of good luck that we happened along right after 
                    Judge Lyckman had plowed his alfalfa field. There was a window 
                    of just a few weeks when the ground was visible and we could 
                    see the artifacts that told of the mission's existence. Had 
                    we come along the month before, or the month after, we would 
                    have joined the long list of searchers who walked right over 
                    the mission without knowing it, simply because the ground 
                    was covered by alfalfa. </p>
                  <p class="text">In reviewing what was found at the mission during 
                    our various excavations there, it is remarkable there was 
                    so little left. The Indians set the place on fire and burned 
                    it down in 1758. They carried away with them many desirable 
                    items. We can imagine that bead necklaces, religious medallions, 
                    knives, hatchets, metal cooking pots, and the like would have 
                    been valued by the Indians and probably were hauled off by 
                    them after the attack. Then, Spanish soldiers came in shortly 
                    after the attack and salvaged what they could from the ruins. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">We can only guess how many people visited the 
                    site between 1758 and the early 1900's when the site's whereabouts 
                    were still generally known. We know from a letter written 
                    in 1901 by J. J. Callan, a resident of Menard, that a substantial 
                    collection of artifacts from the mission was sent to the State 
                    Fair in Dallas. This collection has never been relocated. 
                    In view of all these looting, salvage, and collecting activities 
                    over the years, it is a wonder that we recovered ANY artifacts 
                    from the mission. Yet, with careful recovery, we were able 
                    to find, for example, a scatter of musket balls around the 
                    church that supported the story of Juan Leal and the other 
                    survivors who had sought refuge there during the attack. </p>
                  <p class="text">The wonderful mural of the attack on Mission 
                    San Sab&aacute; Mission gave us a good idea of what the little 
                    mission looked like. Archeological investigations revealed 
                    a pattern of post stains that confirmed the mural depiction. 
                    The stories about the attack and its depiction in the mural 
                    are very dramatic, and we know that the events that unfolded 
                    at the mission were important in Texas history. But the reality 
                    is that the mission was a squalid little place where the priests 
                    and other residents were living in cramped, primitive quarters. 
                    Standing where the church once stood, and thinking about the 
                    musketballs scattered all around, one gets a feel for how 
                    desperate the situation was for Juan Leal and the others who 
                    were trying to survive inside on that March day back in 1758. 
                    The archeology makes it real and brings those days back to 
                    life. </p>
                  <p class="text">We also feel lucky to have found the site 
                    when we did. An elderly man from the Menard area who came 
                    out to visit the 1997 excavations remembered that his grandfather 
                    used to farm the field containing the mission. The man said 
                    his grandfather, who used a mule-drawn plow, did not like 
                    to work in this particular field because he was always hitting 
                    &quot;big burned stumps,&quot; which he had to stop and remove. 
                    We believe that the &quot;stumps&quot; were actually the bases 
                    of wooden posts from the mission stockade and other structures. 
                    </p>
                  <p class="text">By 1993, mechanized farming activities 
                    had eliminated all but the lowest remnants of the posts that 
                    had burned down into the ground&#151;at the most only 2 to 
                    4 inches of the post stains remained. Plows were cutting down 
                    into pit features, such as the pit where the sundial was found, 
                    and dragging up bones, charcoal, and artifacts. I believe 
                    that another 10 or 20 years of farming would have completely 
                    destroyed the post stains and the features. Had we found the 
                    site in the year 2020, the artifacts would still be there, 
                    but we would not be able to trace the footprint of the mission, 
                    its size and layout, because the post stains would be gone. 
                    </p>
                  <p class="text">The San Sab&aacute; Mission site can be viewed 
                    by traveling three miles east on FM 2092 out of Menard. The 
                    1936 Texas Centennial Marker is along the highway immediately 
                    beside the alfalfa field. As Robert Weddle wrote in 1996: 
                    &quot;The rediscovery of Mission Santa Cruz de San Sab&aacute; 
                    represents a triumph for all who seek.&quot; </p>
