      <h2>Spanish Motives: Apache Souls and Precious Metals</h2>
      <p class="text">The Spanish priests and soldiers were motivated to move 
        into the San Sab&aacute; region of Texas for a variety of reasons. Overall, 
        Spain was trying to settle and make productive the vast region of Texas 
        to which it had laid claim. The government was anxious for people to move 
        in, build towns, and begin farming, mining, and ranching activities that 
        would bring revenue to the Spanish Crown. The Spanish were also greatly 
        worried about the expanding presence of the French who controlled present-day 
        eastern Texas and Louisiana. French traders were known to be trading arms 
        to various Indian groups the Spanish viewed as threats, especially the 
        troublesome <em>Norte&ntilde;os&#151;</em>a general term applied to the 
        Comanche, Wichita, and their allies. </p>
      <p class="text">The Catholic priests who came to San Sab&aacute; wanted 
        to bring Christianity to the Native Americans. The San Sab&aacute; Mission 
        was intended specifically for the Lipan Apache Indians, who had asked 
        that a mission be established in their area of Texas. Historians believe 
        that the Lipan were really interested in getting the protection that a 
        Spanish presence would provide. They were under continuous threat from 
        Comanches and other Native American enemies who were trying to push them 
        out of their territory, then concentrated in the southern Edwards Plateau, 
        south and west of present-day Austin.</p>
      <p class="text">In addition to Christianizing the Indians, the Spanish were 
        interested in developing the mineral resources of central Texas. Well 
        before the San Sab&aacute; mission and presidio were established, Spanish 
        prospectors had discovered traces of gold and silver in the Llano Uplift, 
        or Central Mineral Region, of Texas along the Llano River in Mason and 
        Llano counties. In order to exploit the gold and silver, the Spaniards 
        needed to tame and pacify the Indians, partly so the Indians wouldn't 
        attack the miners and settlers, but also because a labor force was needed 
        to work the mines. If the priests could get a large group of Indians to 
        settle in a mission and begin taking up European ways, then the developers 
        would have a ready source of impressed laborers. This was a pattern of 
        development and exploitation that the Spaniards had applied very effectively 
        in Mexico and all across Central and South America where they found tremendous 
        wealth in gold and silver.</p>
      <p class="text">Before a location for the San Sab&aacute; Mission was selected, 
        there were heated arguments between the miners, represented by soldiers, 
        and the priests. The miners wanted the settlement to be near Llano, along 
        the Llano River, close to the mines. The priests needed a place with lots 
        of farmland, water, and other basic necessities required for a successful 
        farming operation. They would need crops and livestock to feed and clothe 
        the many Lipan Apache they hoped to attract and support in their mission. 
        The priests prevailed, and the mission and presidio were built along the 
        upper San Sab&aacute; River in what is now Menard County, from 50 to 70 
        miles west of where the main mining activity would occur.</p>
      <p class="text">In 1757, a train of carts and pack animals reached the location 
        selected for the mission and presidio after moving up through Mexico via 
        Saltillo and San Antonio. Workers immediately began to build the structures 
        that would house and protect the people. Because shelters were needed 
        quickly, the buildings were made of wattle-and-daub. Walls were made of 
        upright poles and logs set into shallow trenches. Spaces between vertical 
        poles were filled in with mud (daub) to form solid walls. The roofs were 
        thatched with a long, coarse grass native to the region. Once the mission 
        and presidio became established, these temporary buildings would be replaced 
        with more permanent stone masonry walls and buildings. The mission, attacked 
        ten months later, was burned to the ground and never rebuilt. About five 
        years after it was founded, the temporary wattle-and-daub presidio was 
        replaced with a huge stone fort, remnants of which can still be seen just 
        west of Menard. </p>
      <p class="text">The mission and presidio were built about four miles apart, 
        on opposite sides of the San Sab&aacute; River. Why was the fort so far 
        from the mission, if the soldiers in the presidio were meant to protect 
        the priest at the mission? The priests did this on purpose, even though 
        they knew that it was dangerous. In earlier settlements built in east 
        Texas, they had learned it was a bad idea to put the missions and presidios 
        too close together. The Indians were afraid to come into the missions 
        if the soldiers were too near. Also, the soldiers were known to molest 
        the Indian women, another strong reason for the Indians to avoid settling 
        in the missions. Learning from these mistakes, the priests decided that 
        the San Sab&aacute; Mission would be located several miles from the presidio. 
        Then, they hoped, the Indians would not be afraid to live in the mission. 
      </p>
      <p class="text">The Lipan Apache never stayed more than a couple of days 
        at the San Sab&aacute; Mission. Partly, it was because they really preferred 
        the canyonlands to the south along the Nueces River, where the San Lorenzo 
        Mission would later be built. The Lipan also feared they would be vulnerable 
        to more Comanche attacks if they settled at San Sab&aacute;. So, the effort 
        to Christianize the Lipan and get them to settle at San Sab&aacute; was 
        a total failure. </p>
      <p class="text">The mining efforts along the Llano River were equally unsuccessful. 
        Though there is unquestionably gold and silver in the Llano Uplift area 
        of Texas, the Spanish prospectors apparently never found commercially 
        viable deposits. If they had, Spain would have made a greater effort to 
        keep control of Central Texas. It would have been worth it to send in 
        more soldiers, priests, and settlers. The fact that Spain didn't go to 
        this effort and expense is the strongest argument against there being 
        a wealth of Spanish treasure buried in central Texas. </p>
      <p class="text">Though the gold and silver deposits were in Llano and Mason 
        counties, the prospectors were bringing ore samples to the San Sab&aacute; 
        Presidio, where they were tested or sent down to Mexico for further analysis 
        by experts there. Later Texans, such as Jim Bowie, were misled by this 
        activity. Jim Bowie and treasure hunters before and after him came to 
        believe that the Spaniards had found tremendous deposits of gold or silver 
        in what is now Menard County. Though geologists have demonstrated that 
        there are no such deposits in the area, treasure hunters to this day continue 
        the search, sometimes with destructive consequences. The damage began 
        in the 1800's when treasure hunters dug up the cemetery at Presidio San 
        Sab&aacute; Presidio, and it has continued ever since.</p>
