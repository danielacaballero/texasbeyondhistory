				  <p class="text">Following the initial discovery of the mission 
                    in September of 1993, Grant Hall, Kay Hindes, and Mark Wolf 
                    organized a testing program funded by the Texas Historical 
                    Foundation, the Lende Foundation, and Bob and Kathleen Gilmore. 
                    Testing of the site was done in late 1993 and early 1994 by 
                    Hall, with the assistance of students from Texas Tech University 
                    and various archeological colleagues. Spanish Colonial expert 
                    Anne Fox from the University of Texas at San Antonio lined 
                    up a group of metal detector operators, all members of the 
                    Southern Texas Archeological Association. Led by Tommy Tomesal, 
                    this group used the detectors very productively to locate 
                    a number of musketballs, nails, brass artifacts, and other 
                    Spanish artifacts across the mission site. The location of 
                    each item was carefully plotted on a map.</p>
                  <p class="text">Test excavations scattered around the site revealed 
                    that much of the original soil deposits and land surface upon 
                    which the mission was built had been cut away or churned up 
                    by farming activities on the land from about 1900 up to the 
                    present. At first we feared that all signs of the mission 
                    had been completely destroyed by plowing. Fortunately, as 
                    testing progressed, we began to find stains representing the 
                    posts used to build the mission stockade, church, and other 
                    buildings. These stains, consisting of ash, charcoal, and 
                    burned soil, marked the spots where wooden posts had burned 
                    down into the ground. The wood itself was gone, but the ash 
                    and charcoal showed where each post had been, and gave us 
                    its approximate diameter. </p>
                  <p class="text">The test excavations carried out in 1993 and 
                    1994 verified that the site was indeed that of Mission San 
                    Sab&aacute;. Though heavily damaged by plowing, there was 
                    still buried evidence in Judge Lyckman's alfalfa field that 
                    could tell a good bit about the configuration of the mission. 
                    But this would require a major excavation and that meant we 
                    needed support. This is often the most difficult obstacle 
                    to overcome for archeologists undertaking pure research projects 
                    and it is something many people don't understand. Major archeological 
                    investigations, even if done with the assistance of volunteers 
                    and students, are time-consuming and costly. A proper investigation 
                    involves a lot more than digging. It takes specialists in 
                    many fields working before, during, and after the excavation. 
                    And the responsibility of the lead investigator is not completed 
                    until a full scientific report is published.</p>
                  <h3>1997 Dig</h3>
                  <p class="text">In 1997, with funding from the Summerlee Foundation 
                    and other benefactors, Texas Tech archeologists returned to 
                    the mission for a full-scale excavation. Once again the team 
                    included a mix of professional archeologists, students, and 
                    volunteers. Realizing the upper soil deposits were churned 
                    by farming, the decision was made to use a small trackhoe 
                    to strip off the disturbed soil. Once this &quot;plow zone&quot; 
                    was removed, we quickly were able to locate and excavate the 
                    post stains and features lying beneath. This approach proved 
                    to be very effective in exposing roughly 100 post stains and 
                    about 30 archeological features. Along the south side of the 
                    field, a narrow strip of the original ground surface was preserved, 
                    protected by a fence line. There, careful hand excavations 
                    took place. </p>
                  <p class="text">The post stains, when plotted out on a map, 
                    revealed a trapezoidal outline shape to the mission stockade, 
                    with the broad end to the west. This side was about 160 feet 
                    in length. The north wall, clearly visible, was about 130 
                    feet in length. The east and south walls of the stockade were 
                    not as easy to make out. However, we speculate that the east 
                    wall was shorter than the west, and ran parallel to it. The 
                    south wall was probably the same length as the north wall. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Within the stockade, we found post stains that 
                    we think represent the church. These defined a building oriented 
                    with the long axis east-west, having dimensions of roughly 
                    35 by 50 feet. The belief that this was the church is supported 
                    by the fact that it was out in front of the traces of other, 
                    smaller buildings. Lead musket balls were concentrated around 
                    it, consistent with the stand that Juan Leal and the other 
                    survivors made in the church. The Indians appear to have fired 
                    many musket shots at the defenders within the church. Another 
                    find was that of an empty grave at the west end of the stains 
                    representing the church. All that was found in this grave 
                    were a human finger bone, a couple of teeth, and a number 
                    of green-glass seed beads. We assume that the body the grave 
                    once contained was disinterred and removed to another location 
                    following the 1758 attack. </p>
                  <p class="text">Along the south wall, on the inside of the stockade, 
                    were post stains representing at least five small buildings. 
                    The largest measured about 14 feet in width and 20 feet in 
                    length. These were probably the house of the priests and soldiers, 
                    storerooms, and kitchens. All in all, the archeological findings 
                    at the mission suggest that the depiction of the mission in 
                    the Terreros mural is fairly accurate. </p>
                  <p class="text">In addition to the empty grave associated with 
                    the church, there was another particularly interesting feature 
                    found in what would have been the northwest corner of the 
                    stockade. This was a pit that contained quite a few oxen bones, 
                    horns, and horn cores. The survivors of the attack said that 
                    the Indians killed all of the livestock at the mission. Later, 
                    they roasted and ate the meat of the oxen. We think this pit 
                    containing the oxen bones was the barbeque pit where the Indians 
                    did their cooking to celebrate their victory. </p>
                  <p class="text">Amid the bones in the barbeque pit, we made 
                    a most unexpected and unusual discovery&#151;that of a small 
                    gold-plated brass pocket sundial bearing the date 1580, some 
                    177 years before the sacking of the mission. This artifact 
                    is one of the earliest scientific instruments of its type&#151;a 
                    universal equinoctial sundial. This sundial was once part 
                    of a two-part navigational instrument. The missing part is 
                    a compass upon which the sundial sat. How this specialized 
                    and rare item found its way to Mission San Sab&aacute; and 
                    into the pit with the cattle bones is a complete mystery. 
                    It was obviously a heirloom item, one that must have belonged 
                    to a well-to-do person. Given its striking appearance, it 
                    seems odd that the Indians didn't carry it off. Perhaps it 
                    was lost amid the celebration.</p>
                  <p class="text">Another mystery remains concerning the mission. 
                    When the Spanish soldiers returned to the scene of death and 
                    destruction several days after the attack, they buried the 
                    two priests and several other men who had been killed and 
                    burned in the Holy Ground by the church. These graves still 
                    have not been found. A couple of explanations come to mind. 
                    Since the bodies were badly decomposed, the graves may have 
                    been dug quickly and were therefore shallow. They may well 
                    have been destroyed by farming in the twentieth century. A 
                    second possibility is that the bodies were later disinterred 
                    from the graves and taken to the San Sab&aacute; Presidio 
                    cemetery, or perhaps back to Mexico. This latter explanation 
                    is consistent with the finding of the emptied grave and seems 
                    the most likely.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Indians who attacked the San Sab&aacute; 
                    Mission in 1758 were unusual for their time in that they were 
                    equipped with firearms, swords, armor and other European weapons. 
                    They obtained these from the French, who then occupied Louisiana 
                    and had hopes of taking over Spanish territory in Texas, in 
                    exchange for buffalo, deer, and other hides and furs. The 
                    French knew that the Indians would use the firearms against 
                    the Spaniards. When the Indians attacked the mission, it was 
                    the first time that the Spaniards had come up against a force 
                    of Native Americans armed with muskets. The many lead musket 
                    balls found at the mission were concentrated in the area of 
                    the site where the church had been. This was the building 
                    where Juan Leal and the other survivors had held out until 
                    nightfall, when they escaped the burning mission and made 
                    it to the safety of the presidio. It is easy to imagine the 
                    Indians circling the church (at a safe distance, because Juan 
                    Leal and the others were firing their muskets at the Indians) 
                    and firing musket shots into its walls in hopes of killing 
                    the Spaniards within. </p>
