            <div class="caption">Dr. Kathleen Gilmore was able to determine from Spanish records 
            that the mission was 1.5 leagues from the presidio. It was near a 
            place where the San Saba River took a sharp turn to the north. There 
            was a lot of arable land around the mission, and it had three sources 
            of water nearby. The site we found met all of these requirements. 
            At 3.95 miles from the presidio, the distance between this site and 
            the presidio was exactly a league-and-a-half. A spring, the river, 
            and Harris Hollow (pictured) served as the three sources of water. 
            The river takes a bend to the north right by the site, and there are 
            two river fords in the vicinity. Broad flood plains on the south side 
            of the river provided the rich farmland sought out by the priests 
            when they selected a site for the mission.</div> </td>

                          strong interest in historic preservation in Menard County. 
                          He led efforts to preserve and restore the presidio. 
                          Judge Lyckman and his wife, Dionitia, gave their permission 
                          for excavations to proceed once the mission was found 
                          on their property east of Menard. Their close cooperation 
                          was critical to the successful investigation of the 
                          mission site. Judge Lyckman was particularly fascinated 
                          by the fired daub marking the mission. He said that 
                          he had noticed these baked clay lumps in the past as 
                          he plowed his alfalfa field. They seemed out of place, 
                          and not a natural thing to be occurring in his field. 
                          He wondered what they were, but never dreamed that they 
                          were evidence of the mission buildings that burned on 
                          his land in 1758.</div>

                  <p class="text">Historians and archeologists began trying to 
                    relocate Mission San Sab&aacute; in the mid-1960s with the 
                    work of Kathleen Gilmore and Dessamae Lorrain. Continued efforts 
                    into the early 1990s had no better luck. A few years later 
                    things took a different turn when a San Antonio architect, 
                    Mark Wolf, began tracing his genealogy. Much to his surprise, 
                    he learned he was a direct descendant of Juan Leal, a Spanish 
                    soldier who had been stationed at the ill-fated mission to 
                    assist the priests. When the Indians attacked the mission 
                    in 1758, Leal organized the defense of the survivors holding 
                    out in the church at the mission. He set up a small cannon 
                    on some boxes and periodically fired it out the door to keep 
                    the Indians at bay. When night fell, Leal and the other survivors 
                    were able to sneak out of the burning mission and make their 
                    way to the safety of the presidio four miles to the west. 
                    Leal later moved to San Antonio, where he lived out the rest 
                    of his life as a prominent citizen in that community.</p>
                  <p class="text">Intrigued by his connection to the story, Wolf 
                    asked Kay Hindes, historian and archeologist from Jourdanton, 
                    if she would take him out to Menard and show him the mission. 
                    She told him that the location of the mission was unknown 
                    despite repeated attempts to find it. Undaunted, Wolf enlisted 
                    Hindes' help to find the mission. They started with a survey 
                    report authored by Shawn Carlson, a Texas A&amp;M archeologist 
                    who had led the last effort to find Mission San Saba. Carlson, 
                    following the research of Kathleen Gilmore, had narrowed the 
                    search to an area along the south side of the San Saba River 
                    east of Menard. Carlson recommended that future searches for 
                    the mission incorporate remote sensing techniques such as 
                    aerial photography. </p>
                  <p class="text">Wolf persuaded a friend who owned a small 
                    plane to help out. They flew over the San Saba River valley 
                    east of Menard and took photographs with different types of 
                    film (color, black-and-white, and infrared). Mark Wolf got 
                    his photos developed and began looking them over for any sign 
                    of the mission. He noticed a couple of promising outlines 
                    on the ground, linear soil discolorations that he thought 
                    could be the remnants of the outer wall or stockade of the 
                    mission. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the spring of 1993, Wolf and Hindes contacted 
                    me (Grant Hall). They asked if I would bring my Texas Tech 
                    archeology field school students over to Menard that summer 
                    to test one of the locations that looked promising in the 
                    aerial photographs. My students and I were joined by Kathleen 
                    Gilmore and Shawn Carlson, both of whom still had a keen interest 
                    in helping locate the site. Unfortunately, the anomalies in 
                    the photographs we investigated during the summer of 1993 
                    all turned out to be false leads. </p>
                  <p class="text">While Wolf was looking at aerial photos and 
                    we were testing sites, Kay Hindes had been doing research 
                    at the Center for American History at UT Austin. There she 
                    found a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Rise and Fall of Mission 
                    San Saba. &quot; It was written by John Warren Hunter, editor 
                    of the Menard newspaper and was published in 1905. Historians 
                    had dismissed the Hunter account as a fanciful and indiscriminate 
                    &quot;tacky little pamphlet.&quot; But Hindes read it anyway 
                    and noticed that Hunter stated the mission was on &quot;the 
                    old Hockensmith place,&quot; and that you could still go out 
                    there and pick up lots of relics. Following up on this lead, 
                    Hindes went to the deed records in Menard and found that there 
                    had been only one Hockensmith family living in Menard County 
                    back in 1905. The &quot;old Hockensmith place&quot; had been 
                    out east of Menard along the San Saba River. Hindes traced 
                    the deed records and learned that this land was now owned 
                    by Otis and Dionitia Lyckman of Menard. </p>
                  <p class="text">Over Labor Day Weekend in 1993, Kay Hindes, 
                    Mark and Kim Wolf , and I were in Menard to test another location 
                    that Mark had seen in his aerial photos. On the way out to 
                    this location we passed the Lyckman's land. We noticed that 
                    Menard County Judge Lyckman had just plowed the alfalfa field 
                    right by the highway. Kay remarked: &quot;That's where John 
                    Warren Hunter says the mission is located.&quot; I replied: 
                    &quot;Well, since Judge Lyckman has just plowed that field, 
                    we ought to go in there and take a look. The ground visibility 
                    will never be better than it is now.&quot; Kay got Lyckman's 
                    permission for us to enter his land. </p>
                  <p class="text">Soon we were walking across the freshly plowed 
                    field, which would normally have been densely blanketed with 
                    alfalfa. As we approached what we now know is the actual mission 
                    location, I started seeing some fired clay daub. I remarked 
                    that this was what we would expect to find as a result of 
                    the burning that occurred when the mission was destroyed. 
                    Shortly after that, Kay Hindes picked up an artifact. She 
                    looked at it for a second and said: &quot;This is what we 
                    are looking for!&quot; She had found a piece of Spanish pottery&#151;a 
                    thick fragment of a green-glazed olive jar. Looking over this 
                    area of the field more carefully, we quickly found about 30 
                    more pieces of pottery and quite a bit of burned bone. We 
                    were elated and reasonably certain we had found the mission. 
                    But we also knew we needed more definitive proof.</p>

                          daub that were found at the mission site. The temporary 
                          buildings erected at the mission in 1757 were made of 
                          wattle and daub, the walls being wooden poles stuck 
                          into the ground. The chinks between the poles were filled 
                          by pressing daub (mud) into them. The daub was strengthened 
                          by the addition of grass. When the mission was set on 
                          fire, the wood burned, but the fire-hardened daub survived. 
                          This daub specimen preserves impressions of the grass 
                          that was mixed in to strengthen it.</div>
