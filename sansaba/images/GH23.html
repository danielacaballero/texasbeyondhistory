      Hindes, and Mark Wolf. County judge for 25 years, Lyckman has a strong interest 
      in historic preservation in Menard County. He led efforts to preserve and 
      restore the presidio. Judge Lyckman and his wife, Dionitia, gave their permission 
      for excavations to proceed once the mission was found on their property 
      east of Menard. Their close cooperation was critical to the successful investigation 
      of the mission site. Judge Lyckman was particularly fascinated by the fired 
      daub marking the mission. He said that he had noticed these baked clay lumps 
      in the past as he plowed his alfalfa field. They seemed out of place, and 
      not a natural thing to be occurring in his field. He wondered what they 
      were, but never dreamed that they were evidence of the mission buildings 
      that burned on his land in 1758.<!-- #EndEditable --></td>
