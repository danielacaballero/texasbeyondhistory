                  <p class="text">On the morning of March 16, 1758, Mission Santa 
                    Cruz de San Sab&aacute;, a small, hastily constructed compound 
                    enclosed by a wooden palisade, was surrounded by 2000 hostile 
                    Indians including Wichita, Comanche, and Caddo warriors. The 
                    three Spanish priests in residence tried to placate the allied 
                    native force with gifts and offers of safe passage to the 
                    nearby Presidio, but the palisade was soon overcome and Father 
                    Terreros, the mission leader, was killed along with several 
                    others. A small group of people who survived the attack took 
                    refuge in the church, the mission's largest structure. Meanwhile, 
                    the palisade and several buildings were set on fire as the 
                    Indians sacked the place and began celebrating victory. Sporadic 
                    fighting continued as the Indians fired their French muskets 
                    at the church and tried to gain entry. </p>
                  <p class="text">Four miles upstream, the 30 soldiers at the 
                    Presidio San Sab&aacute; heard the terrible din, saw the smoke 
                    from the fires, and were soon surrounded themselves. While 
                    they were able to keep the Indians at bay, the soldiers could 
                    not come to the rescue of the mission&#151;two-thirds of the 
                    garrison was away on various forays. As night fell, the victorious 
                    allied natives roasted several slaughtered oxen and feasted 
                    a short distance from the beleaguered missionaries. While 
                    the victorious Indians were feasting, the survivors led by 
                    Juan Leal, escaped the burning church under cover of darkness 
                    and made their way to the Presidio, many of them badly wounded. 
                    The arrival of additional reinforcements (returning soldiers) 
                    at the Presidio the next day apparently saved the garrison 
                    from a similar fate as that of the mission.</p>
                  <p class="text">Burned and shattered, the abandoned Mission 
                    San Sab&aacute; passed into history and legend, illustrated 
                    by the famous mural shown above. Presidio San Sab&aacute; 
                    was strengthened and manned for another decade because of 
                    its strategic role in Spanish mining operations nearby, but 
                    then it, too, was abandoned as the Spanish frontier retreated 
                    southward. The ruins of the presidio remained as highly visible 
                    reminders of the Spanish presence. But the remnants of the 
                    sacked mission, never substantial to begin with, dwindled. 
                    Picked over time and again by souvenir hunters, it disappeared 
                    as a known place shortly after 1900. Historians and archeologists 
                    began trying to relocate Mission San Sab&aacute; in the mid-1960s, 
                    but it was not until 1993 that the search met success.</p>
                  <p class="text">This exhibit tells the story of the rediscovery 
                    of Mission San Sab&aacute; and the archeological investigations 
                    that followed. While some of the history of the place and 
                    the period is presented here (see <a href="motives.html" class="text">Spanish 
                    Motives</a>), there are many excellent historical accounts 
                    that give more of the details (see <a href="credits.html" class="text">Credits 
                    &amp; Sources</a>). The story of Mission San Sab&aacute; and 
                    its rediscovery presents fascinating lessons in how events 
                    are viewed by history as well as the interplay between history, 
                    archeology, and luck. </p>
                  <p class="text">The archeologist who narrates the remainder 
                    of this exhibit is <b>Dr. Grant D. Hall</b>, Associate Professor 
                    of Anthropology at Texas Tech University. Born and raised 
                    in Texas, Hall has carried out numerous archeological investigations 
                    in the coastal plains, south and central Texas, and the Maya 
                    Lowlands. Since 1990, he has taught at Texas Tech and involved 
                    his undergraduate and graduate students in an ambitious regional 
                    research program centered on the San Sab&aacute; River valley. 
                    Every summer a Texas Tech field school is held in the region, 
                    usually at localities between Menard and San Sab&aacute;, 
                    Texas. The students always get a good basic training in archeological 
                    field methods as well as the chance to help uncover San Sab&aacute; 
                    history and prehistory.</p>
                  <p class="text">Today Hall is joined at Texas Tech by Dr. Tamra 
                    Walter, a specialist in historical archeology. They and their 
                    students are excavating Presidio San Sab&aacute; to reveal 
                    more of its history and obtain the evidence needed for a historically 
                    accurate reconstruction. They enjoy the strong support of 
                    the people and civic leaders of Menard who hope to make the 
                    Presidio a focal point for tourism and history.</p>
                  <h3>&quot;<em>The Destruction of Mission San Sab&aacute;</em>&quot;</h3>
                  <p class="text">The famous mural was painted in Mexico City, 
                    perhaps in 1765, about 6 years after the mission was destroyed. 
                    The painting was commissioned by Don Pedro Romero de Terreros, 
                    cousin of one of the first priests killed in the attack. Terreros 
                    had made a fortune in mining down in Mexico and put up the 
                    money to finance the Mission San Sab&aacute;. Though the artist 
                    was never in central Texas, he was advised by eyewitnesses 
                    as to the appearance of the mission and the details of the 
                    Indian attack. A careful examination reveals that the mural 
                    tells the story of the attack, including the fates of the 
                    two priests who were killed. The blue shields beside each 
                    priest contain their biographical sketches.</p>
                  <img src="images/mural-crop3.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="211">
                  <p class="text">Archeological findings at the mission confirm 
                    that the mural is fairly accurate. The houses, church, and 
                    stockade were built of wooden posts and poles. The roofs were 
                    thatch. This building technique is known as wattle-and-daub 
                    in English. In Spanish, the method is known as jacal (pronounced 
                    HAH-call), and it is still in use in Mexico and other Latin 
                    American countries. In addition to the mural and verbal descriptions 
                    of how the mission looked, we have fired clay daub and post 
                    stains uncovered at the site to provide further evidence of 
                    the size and configuration of the mission compound and the 
                    methods used in its construction. </p>
                  <p class="text">The mural is thought to be the earliest painting 
                    by a professional artist depicting an historical scene in 
                    Texas. It is still in the possession of Terreros family descendants 
                    in Mexico. The family shipped the mural to the United States 
                    for sale in the early 1990s. Controversy ensued and the Mexican 
                    government claimed the mural as national patrimony. It was 
                    returned to Mexico.</p>
