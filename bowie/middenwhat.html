            <p class="text">A typical <strong>burned rock midden</strong> is a 
              low, donut-shaped mound of heat-fractured rocks and other cooking 
              debris that accumulated over time from many plant-baking episodes 
              that took place in a baking pit in the center of the midden. </p>
            <p class="text">Thousands of years ago, prehistoric peoples learned 
              that heated rocks can be used very effectively to bake certain plant 
              foods, such as bulbs or fibrous plant &quot;hearts,&quot; which 
              must be cooked at least overnight and sometimes for several days 
              before they are edible. Open fires, with or without rocks, lose 
              their heat relatively quickly once the fuel is consumed. In contrast, 
              rocks heated within a pit and covered by layers of plants and insulating 
              earth, can hold heat for up to 48 hours. The larger and more numerous 
              the rocks, the more slowly they will dissipate heat and the longer 
              they will stay hot enough to cook the food. This technology is called 
              <strong>earth oven cooking</strong> or <strong>pit baking</strong> 
              and it was known throughout most of the ancient world. </p>
            <p class="text">Burned rock middens are common across central and 
              southwestern Texas and were first recognized as cooking features 
              by archeologists in the early part of the twentieth century. The 
              first systematic investigation of these rock middens was begun by 
              by James E. Pearce at the University of Texas around 1917. Pearce 
              called these features &quot;kitchen middens&quot; and thought they 
              were the result of numerous fires built within circles of stone 
              to keep the fire contained for cooking and warmth. Others, he believed, 
              could be attributed to &quot;stone boiling,&quot; a procedure in 
              which heated stones were placed into a vessel containing water and 
              food in order to cook the food. </p>
            <p class="text">Later archeologists proposed various alternative ideas 
              or models of how middens formed. The first of these,&#8212;the<strong> 
              intersecting hearth </strong>model,&#8212;was described by J. Charles 
              Kelley and Thomas Campbell in 1942. They believed that piles of 
              burned rock gradually accumulated as numerous small cooking hearths 
              were built in the same general area; over time, the broken rocks 
              from all of the hearths formed a burned rock midden. In contrast, 
              in the late 1960s William Sorrow proposed a <strong>communal dump</strong> 
              model. In this scenario, burned rock middens are the result of prehistoric 
              people dumping used rock in a central discard heap&#151;the actual 
              cooking taking place in hearths scattered across the larger campsite. 
              Over time, as people returned to the same campsite was reused and 
              enough burned rock was discarded in the same place, a mound would 
              be formed.</p>
            <h3>Anatomy of a Midden: The Central Feature or Earth Oven Model </h3>
            <p class="text">Today, the prevailing notion is the <strong>central 
              feature</strong> or <strong>earth oven model </strong>proposed by 
              TBH editor Steve Black and his colleagues at the Texas Archeological 
              Research Laboratory in the mid-1990s. This explanation partially 
              builds on several of the earlier ideas in Central Texas, as well 
              as ethnohistoric accounts of the use of similar features by native 
              peoples throughout the Southwestern United States. Pearce correctly 
              realized that the cooking was taking place in the central area of 
              the middens, but he didn't understand hot rock cooking. Sorrow was 
              right about middens representing mainly dumps, but he failed to 
              recognize that the source of the rock was from within the midden 
              itself. </p>
            <p class="text">The two most important new insights are: (1) the realization 
              that most middens formed around a central feature or baking pit; 
              and (2) a pragmatic understanding of earth oven cooking, the only 
              plausible process that could result in so many mounds of spent cooking 
              stones. While many kinds of plant and animal foods can be baked 
              in earth ovens, it is a labor-intensive and resource-intensive cooking 
              method that is mainly used to cook certain kinds of plants. </p>
            <p class="text">Before considering what, exactly, was being cooked 
              in earth ovens, it is helpful to understand how they work. For a 
              small earth oven, the first step is digging a pit, usually a shallow 
              pit a foot or so deep and 1-1.5 meters (3-5 feet) across. Within 
              this pit&#8212;called an <strong>oven pit </strong>or<strong> baking 
              pit</strong>&#8212;a blazing wood fire is built, upon which large 
              rocks are heaped. As the fire burns down, the rocks become very 
              hot&#8212;sometimes even glowing hot. Using a long fire pole, the 
              cook arranges the hot rocks into a circular bed with a flat or concave 
              upper surface. This hot rock bed will function as a <strong>heating 
              element</strong> or <strong>thermal storage device</strong> that 
              holds and slowly releases heat. </p>
            <p class="text">As soon as the heating element is ready, it is quickly 
              covered with a thick layer of green plant material such as wet grass 
              or prickly pear pads. This<strong> </strong>lower layer of <strong>packing 
              material</strong> serves two purposes: it keeps the food from direct 
              contact with the rocks and coals and, most importantly, it releases 
              steam. The <strong>food layer</strong> is added next and covered 
              with an upper layer of packing material that adds more moisture 
              and keeps the food clean. The final addition is an <strong>earthen 
              cap</strong>&#8212;a thick layer of earth holds the steamy heat 
              within the oven. </p>
            <p class="text">A properly constructed earth oven will stay hot for 
              many hours&#8212;up to 48 hours in some cases. The cooking time 
              varies depending on what and how much is being cooked. After the 
              desired cooking time is up, the earthen cap, upper packing material, 
              and the food layers are removed, leaving the bottom layers undisturbed. 
              Days, weeks, or even years later, prehistoric cooks often returned 
              to reuse an existing oven pit&#8212;reusing an old pit is much easier 
              than digging a new one. Before they could build a new oven, they 
              first had to clean out the pit and dismantle the old heating element. 
              As they did this, they sorted through the rocks at the bottom of 
              the pit. Any large rocks that remain more or less intact were put 
              to one side to be reused. The many fist-sized fragments broken by 
              <strong>thermal cycling</strong> (heating and cooling) were tossed 
              out of the pit, forming a debris ring or mound around the pit. The 
              more the pit was used, the larger the ring or &quot;midden&quot; 
              of broken rock became.</p>

                  <h3>What Was Being Cooked?</h3>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists long debated what was being cooked 
                    at burned rock midden sites. Some of the suggestions have 
                    been based on charred plant and animal remains found within 
                    middens and some have been based on other factors, such as 
                    the distribution of certain plants. One notion that became 
                    popular in the 1970s is that middens were places where large 
                    quantities of <strong>acorns</strong> were processed to remove 
                    the tannins (acids) and to render the acorns edible. Another 
                    proposed idea is that the main food item was <strong>meat 
                    from large animals</strong> such as deer and bison. Both of 
                    these ideas are problematic because there is no good reason 
                    to think that either acorn processing or meat baking would 
                    require large quantities of heated rocks. Some California 
                    tribes used stone boiling in acorn processing, but they used 
                    types of rocks that could be repeatedly heated without breaking. 
                    Meat can be cooked in earth ovens, but most meat can be easily 
                    cooked over an open fire.</p>
                  <p class="text">Today, there is convincing evidence that the 
                    main thing being cooked was plant food, especially that obtained 
                    from  <strong>certain kinds of starch- and inulin-rich plants</strong> 
                    including sotol, agave lechuguilla, and members of the lily 
                    family, such as wild onions. Charred fragments of such plants 
                    have now been found at numerous burned rock middens.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the Camp Bowie area, the most likely candidates 
                    are <strong>geophytes</strong>, herbaceous plants with underground 
                    storage organs (bulbs), such as wild onions, that require 
                    long-term baking to make the plant digestible. There are several 
                    different kinds of geophytes with various types of storage 
                    organs (bulbs, tubers, etc.). Good descriptions of the different 
                    kinds of bulbs can be found on the website for the <a href="http://www.hort.cornell.edu/department/faculty/wmiller/bulb/what.html" target="_blank" class="text">Flower 
                    Bulb Research Program</a>.</p>
                  <p class="text">While it is quite likely that various kinds 
                    of foods were prepared at burned rock midden sites, many preparation 
                    techniques probably contributed little or nothing to the accumulation 
                    of burned rocks. The one thing we know for certain is that 
                    it took lots of time, labor, and material (stones, fuel wood, 
                    packing plants, and earth) to construct earth ovens as well 
                    as time and labor to gather and prepare the large amounts 
                    of food, of whatever type, that were cooked in them.</p>

                  <div class="caption">In southwest and far west Texas, lechuguilla, 
                    the smallest species of the agave family, was one of the main 
                    plants baked in earth ovens. The plants shown here are drought 
                    stricken and unsuited for baking. In wet years, lechuguilla 
                    plants are greener and filled out; when properly baked for 
                    several days, lechuguilla hearts are quite sweet and readily 
                    digestible. Photo by Phil Dering. </div></td>
