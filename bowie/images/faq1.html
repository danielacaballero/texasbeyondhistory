      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions:<br>
        <em>What are the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods?</em></h2>
      <p>The <b>Archaic</b> period or era is a very long span of human history 
        in North America that began about 9,500 years ago (7,500 B.C.) and lasted, 
        in the Camp Bowie area, until about 1200 years ago (A.D. 800). The Archaic 
        concept was originally conceived of as an evolutionary stage of cultural 
        development during which prehistoric peoples lived as hunter-gatherers 
        and adapted to virtually every environment in North America. Today, however, 
        archeologists realize that hunting and gathering was the dominate way 
        of life during the preceeding Paleoindian era. And while the Archaic period 
        was followed by the rise of agriculture and settled life in some areas 
        of North America, peoples in other areas including much of central and 
        southern Texas, continued living much as they had for thousands of years. 
        In the Camp Bowie area, the Archaic period is said to end about 1200 years 
        ago (A.D. 800) when the bow and arrow replaced the atlatl and dart at 
        the beginning of the <strong>Late Prehistoric </strong>period. Some late 
        prehistoric groups learned to make pottery at about the same time, but 
        they maintained a traditional way of life based on hunting and gathering. 
        The Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods are really somewhat arbitrary 
        classifications of convenience. Archeologists have subdivided the periods 
        into subperiods and phases in various ways based on changes in certain 
        artifact styles (mainly projectile points). The arrival of Spanish explorers 
        in the late 17th century marks the beginning of the <strong>Historic</strong> 
        period and the era of written history. </p>
