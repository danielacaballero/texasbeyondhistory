			  <!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->Geologic map of the Camp 
      Bowie area. The numerous sources of sandstone and limestone in the major 
      geological formations within Camp Bowie made it an ideal location for constructing 
      earth ovens, as well as obtaining chert for making stone tools. Holocene 
      age (Qal) floodplain deposits, containing a variety of gravels, are associated 
      with the secondary streams within the camp, as well as the Pecan Bayou floodplain 
      just to the northeast of the project area. The Qu designation denotes Holocene 
      or Pleistocene surficial deposits, which can exceed 50 feet in thickness 
      in some areas. These are primarily limestone, with cherts and some quartz 
      present. The Travis Peak Formation (Ktp), is Cretaceous in age, and contains 
      a variety of materials including conglomerate, sandstone, and limestone. 
      Cherts and quartz are present in the lower part of the formation. Finally, 
      the Strawn Group (IPst) is a Pennsylvanian-age deposit containing sandstone, 
      shale, mudstone, conglomerate, siltstone, and limestone. Several cases of 
      sandstone deposits (e.g., ss32) are present as well. Map adapted from V. 
      E. Barnes, Geologic Atlas of Texas, Brownwood Sheet, UT Bureau of Economic 
      Geology 1976. <!-- #EndEditable -->
