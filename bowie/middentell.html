                  <p class="text">Studying the burned rock middens at Camp Bowie 
                    was a painstaking but rewarding process. After the last shovelfull 
                    of dirt was sifted and the last rock sorted and counted, researchers 
                    at the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at UTSA had 
                    compiled a wealth of information that helps us better understand 
                    how prehistoric peoples lived in the region. Animal bones 
                    and plant remains&#151;particularly the surprising prevalence 
                    of flower bulbs&#151;provide a fascinating look at prehistoric 
                    diet as well as an indication of what the environment was 
                    like during the time of the middens. Chipped stone artifacts 
                    and oven construction techniques brought prehistoric technologies 
                    into focus. Radiocarbon dates of charcoal samples helped establish 
                    a timeline for midden use.</p>
                  <p class="text">When all of the different types of evidence 
                    was combined, a picture of late prehistoric life in what is 
                    now Brown County, Texas, emerged. On a larger scale, the Camp 
                    Bowie data can be compared with that from other investigated 
                    middens across the state.</p>
                  <h3>Midden Structure: What It Takes to Cook with Rock </h3>
                  <p class="text">The burned rock middens at Camp Bowie are &quot;central 
                    feature&quot; middens. The mounds, which are generally 10-15 
                    meters (33-49 feet) in diameter, have a central depression 
                    within which most of the cooking took place. In order to understand 
                    how the middens were constructed, the archeologists excavated 
                    test pits (units) within the centers of the middens and on 
                    the &quot;rings&quot; of the middens. These 1-x-1 meter units 
                    (3.3-x-3.3 feet) were excavated in 10-centimeter levels (uniform 
                    artificial layers about 4 inches thick), and the artifacts 
                    found within each level were collected. The burned rocks from 
                    each level were sorted by size, counted, and then discarded.</p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the Camp Bowie middens had a clearly 
                    defined central feature&#151;a pit&#151;usually containing 
                    high concentrations of charcoal and lined with rocks. The 
                    archeologists knew that any charred plant remains they found 
                    in the pits were likely either the remains of food cooked 
                    in the pit or of the wood used to fuel the fires. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Texas archeologists have learned more about 
                    how middens formed by creating experimental earth ovens using 
                    various techniques. The experiments have shown that it takes 
                    a considerable quantity of wood and stone to heat an earth 
                    oven to a temperature hot enough to cook the food in it. For 
                    a pit approximately 1.5 meters (5 feet) in diameter and .5 
                    meters (1.6 feet) deep, roughly 200 kilograms (441 pounds) 
                    of rock and 250 kilograms (551 pounds) of wood are needed 
                    to create an earth oven that would stay hot for at least 36 
                    hours. </p>
                  <p class="text">These experimental data also provide an estimate 
                    on the amount of refuse (fractured rock) produced after several 
                    firings. Based on these experimental findings, one of the 
                    larger burned rock middens at Camp Bowie may represent more 
                    than 300 firings. Collectively, this would have required 86,500 
                    kilograms (190,698 pounds) of wood and 48,250 kilograms (106,150 
                    pounds) of rock over the life of the midden! It is also estimated 
                    that up to 5,000 plant bulbs could have been cooked during 
                    a single firing. (Keep in mind that these bulbs were small&#151;about 
                    the size of a scallion or green onion.)</p>
                  <p class="text">With so much wood and rock needed, it seems 
                    likely that earth ovens would be built (and middens would 
                    form) close to concentrations of these resources to reduce 
                    the amount of labor needed. Camp Bowie is situated in an area 
                    with several geological formations that would provide abundant 
                    stone for rock-lined earth ovens. The large floodplain of 
                    Pecan Bayou may have had large stands of oak trees, and eastern 
                    camas, wild onions, and other bulbs. The availability of rock 
                    and wood close to where the bulbs grew made the Camp Bowie 
                    area the perfect setting for the earth ovens.</p>
                  <h3>Food and Fuel: Identifying the Plant Remains </h3>
                  <p class="text">Finding prehistoric plant remains in open-air 
                    sites (i.e., unlike protected sites, such as rockshelters 
                    or caves) is uncommon. Unprotected from the elements, most 
                    plant remains would rot in the ground long before any archeologist 
                    found them. The plant fragments archeologists recovered from 
                    the Camp Bowie midden sites had been burned and carbonized. 
                    If left intact, carbonized material, such as wood charcoal, 
                    will preserve for hundreds or even thousands of years. While 
                    the burning process served to preserve certain plants fragments, 
                    it also tended to make species identification more difficult. 
                    In the case of bulbs, heat and pressure can change the bulb 
                    shape. In many cases, however, the structure of the plant 
                    was sufficiently intact for the analyst to identify it using 
                    comparative collections of unburned plants and identification 
                    keys. </p>
                  <p class="text">The charred plant samples recovered during excavations 
                    consisted of wood charcoal and what the archeologists thought 
                    were burned seeds. This material was sent to paleobotanist 
                    and archeologist Dr. Phil Dering for identification. It turned 
                    out that most of the charred remains identified as seeds were 
                    in fact plant bulbs or <i>geophytes</i>. Dering identified 
                    nearly <b>400 bulbs and pieces of bulbs</b> and only one seed&#151;a 
                    charred mesquite seed&#151;as well as several species of charred 
                    wood, including oak, mesquite, juniper and willow. Oak was 
                    by far the most common wood species identified. </p>
                  <p class="text">Bulbs are not roots but instead are modified 
                    leaves arranged in a rosette fashion around a compressed, 
                    central stem similar to an artichoke. The thickened, modified 
                    leaves of a bulb are termed bulb scales. Because they are 
                    leaves, the epidermal cells (outer skin) of bulb scales have 
                    distinctive shapes that are duplicated within a species, and 
                    are often unique to that species. The epidermal pattern provides 
                    a key diagnostic feature for identifying the genus or species 
                    of the plant because the overall shape of any bulb is modified 
                    during charring. </p>
                  <p class="text">In order to identify prehistoric geophytes from 
                    this and other sites, Dering has established a reference collection 
                    of modern geophytes that would have been present in the area 
                    and used in prehistoric times. Photographs of the inner and 
                    outer epidermal layers of the modern examples (taken using 
                    a scanning electron microscope) were used for comparison to 
                    the charred archeological specimens. Dering identified three 
                    species of bulbs from the Camp Bowie burned rock middens: 
                    eastern camas, wild onion, and dog's-tooth violet. These are 
                    all species of bulbs that have been used by Native Americans 
                    in historic times. </p>

                          the middens. These types of data helped investigators

                  <p class="text">The majority of the identified bulbs were of 
                    eastern camas (<i>Camassia scilloides</i>, also called wild 
                    hyacinth). Central Texas is at the southwesternmost extent 
                    of the historic distribution of eastern camas. Eastern camas 
                    tends to grow in moderately wet areas. Its range may have 
                    extended farther south and west during wetter periods in the 
                    past. The bulbs have the highest nutritional value in the 
                    spring, about the time the flower stalks begin to rise, and 
                    this is likely when they would have been collected. It is 
                    also the time of year when other plant resources are scarce 
                    and most mammals are in poor condition (having burned up stored 
                    fat to survive the winter). </p>
                  <p class="text">The use of earth ovens to &quot;bulk process&quot; 
                    camas is best known in the Pacific Northwest and northern 
                    Rocky Mountains. Archeologist Alston V. Thoms (now at Texas 
                    A&amp;M) combined early historic accounts and archeological 
                    evidence to show how the native use of western camas (<strong>Camassia 
                    quamash</strong>) intensified over time. Initial use began 
                    at least 7,000 years ago and the plant became a staple in 
                    the region around 4,000 years ago even though it was a &quot;high-cost&quot; 
                    resource (i.e., one that required lots of labor relative to 
                    caloric return). Thoms linked the intensification of camas 
                    exploitation in the Pacfic Northwest to increasing population 
                    pressure. Texas researchers have applied many of Thoms' ideas 
                    to understanding the burned rock middens of central Texas.

                    middens are of significance to researchers in Texas and beyond. 
                    According to Dering, the collection is the largest preserved 
                    assemblage of plant food from earth ovens recovered from sites 
                    on the periphery of the Southern Plains. Further, the identification 
                    of the dog's-tooth violet marks the first identification of 
                    this plant from an archeological site. The best record of 
                    its use by historic tribes comes from observations of the 
                    Thompson River Indians in southwestern British Columbia. The 
                    Thompson Indians understood that the raw bulbs of dog's-tooth 
                    violet were poisonous, and they pit-baked the bulbs in order 
                    to remove the poison. </p>

                  <p class="text">Archeologists found a variety of chipped stone 
                    tools and animal bones at the Camp Bowie sites. In all, however, 
                    only 16 <strong>diagnostic artifacts</strong>&#151;those representing 
                    distinctive styles known to date to certain time periods&#151;were 
                    found within the middens. These include, from oldest to youngest, 
                    a Middle Archaic dart point, seven Late Archaic dart points, 
                    and eight Late Prehistoric arrow points. With the one Middle 
                    Archaic exception, these diagnostics fall into the same time 
                    periods as the radiocarbon evidence discussed below).</p>
                  <p class="text">A variety of different types of chipped stone 
                    tools used for butchering animals, scraping hides, chopping 
                    wood, and other daily tasks also were found, along with quantities 
                    of chipping debris left behind by prehistoric tool makers. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Of interest were ground stone artifacts and 
                    features related to food processing&#151;the grinding or pounding 
                    of plants, seeds, and nuts. Hand-held <i>manos</i>, or grinding 
                    stones, such as the one shown at left, would have been used 
                    in combination with grinding slabs, broad stones with shallow 
                    depressions that served as receptacles for nuts and seeds 
                    as they were pulverized or ground into meal. </p>
                  <p class="text">Near one of the midden sites, archeologists 
                    discovered 12 bedrock mortar holes. These deep, circular holes 
                    in flat limestone bedrock have been worn from the pressure 
                    of prehistoric people pounding food with stone or wooden pestles. 
                    The mortars were grouped in clusters of three and nine and 
                    were flanked by two middens. They are roughly 8 to10 cm (3 
                    to 4 inches) in diameter and 6 to 10 cm (2.5 to 4 inches) 
                    deep, although several were as large as 20 to 25 cm (8 to 
                    10 inches) in diameter with depths up to 20 cm. A map showing 
                    distribution of the mortars and middens can be seen by clicking 
                    on the mortar image.</p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists also recovered animal bones in 
                    the middens, though they were not common. Bone tends to weather 
                    and deteriorate over time, whether on the surface or buried 
                    in the ground. Among the identifiable bones were those of 
                    white-tailed deer, bison, jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, 
                    birds, and turtles.</p>
                  <h3>Dating the Middens at Camp Bowie </h3>
                  <p class="text">In addition to determining what the burned rock 
                    middens at Camp Bowie were used for, the archeologists also 
                    wanted to know <i>when</i> the middens were used. The most 
                    reliable dating evidence at most prehistoric sites is radiocarbon 
                    dating. <strong>Radiocarbon dates</strong> or <strong>assays</strong> 
                    are statistical estimates of the age of the dated material. 
                    Dates were obtained on 31 samples of charcoal from the middens&#151;most 
                    of the dated charcoal represents fragments of firewood. The 
                    results indicate that most of the Camp Bowie middens were 
                    used primarily during a relatively brief period spanning some 
                    650 years. </p>
                  <p class="text">The radiocarbon date chart on the left shows 
                    that 28 of the dates fall during the Late Prehistoric period 
                    between A.D. 750 and 1400. A single date falls slightly earlier 
                    at A.D. 600 and two dates fall even earlier, within the Late 
                    Archaic period, at 600 B.C. and 1200 B.C . </p>
                  <p class="text">The charcoal samples chosen for radiocarbon 
                    dating came from different levels within excavation units 
                    in 17 of the middens. The sampling strategy was to try to 
                    get multiple dates from different levels within the same 1-x-1-m 
                    excavation unit. Whenever possible, the samples were obtained 
                    from units positioned on the midden ring rather than within 
                    the center of the midden. The thought was, if the middens 
                    form from repeated raking out of a central feature, with the 
                    removed material being deposited in the ring, then deposits 
                    located in the ring would likely be less disturbed than those 
                    in the central midden. It was assumed that the central areas 
                    of the Camp Bowie middens had been repeatedly churned up as 
                    earth ovens were built and rebuilt there. </p>
                  <p class="text">Multiple samples were not available from some 
                    middens and in these cases the archeologists attempted to 
                    obtain samples from the lowest possible level within the midden. 
                    The radiocarbon date chart presents the probability distribution 
                    for each of these 31 (calibrated) midden dates from Camp Bowie. 
                    The dates are grouped by site, and within each site, by increasing 
                    depth. Dates from the same unit within a site are identified 
                    by different color groupings. The samples from sites with 
                    only a single date, or dates from different units within the 
                    same midden, are shaded in black. </p>
                  <p class="text">There are 10 sites that have multiple dates 
                    from the same unit. These 10 color groupings in the chart 
                    are represented by 23 different dates. In all cases with multiple 
                    dates from different levels the radiocarbon dates form a pattern 
                    as expected, with older dates occurring at increasing depth. 
                    That is, in no case is there a statistically significant reversal 
                    of the dates (such as older above younger). This striking 
                    consistency is somewhat surprising in view of the fact that 
                    many of the charcoal pieces were quite small and could have 
                    moved up or down through the midden by gravity and disturbances 
                    such as tree roots and animal burrows. Given these results, 
                    it would appear that the midden rings gradually accumulated 
                    and were seldom disturbed.</p>
                  <h3>The Distribution of Burned Rock Middens Across Texas </h3>
                  <p class="text"> CAR researchers used their understanding of 
                    middens developed from the Camp Bowie data to look at broader 
                    patterns in midden use. Their first task was to look at the 
                    distribution of burned rock middens across Texas. They reviewed 
                    over 9,000 site forms and compiled all site records of burned 
                    rock middens for over 900 sites from more than 50 counties. 
                    These data were combined with an earlier study by archeologist 
                    Darrell Creel (TARL) to produce a data base of over 1,400 
                    burned rock midden sites from 70 counties across the state. 
                    When the density of burned rock midden sites is plotted by 
                    county, the greatest concentration of sites is on the Edwards 
                    Plateau and in southwest Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">Because using pit ovens required a great deal 
                    of wood, it also is useful to compare the distribution of 
                    burned rock middens to the distribution of woody vegetation, 
                    especially oak, which is usually the dominate fuel wood found 
                    in burned rock middens (also, charred acorns are sometimes 
                    found in middens). However, because maps only exist for modern 
                    vegetation patterns, the distribution findings are only a 
                    broad indicator of differences in wood types.</p>
                  <p class="text">The map on the left indicates that the distribution 
                    of burned rock middens within the state is tightly confined, 
                    concentrated primarily on the Edwards Plateau and in west 
                    Texas. Comparisons of midden distribution with plant distribution 
                    patterns (map on right) shows that, while the distributions 
                    of oak and middens partially overlap, there are high densities 
                    of middens found well southwest of the Edwards Plateau, in 
                    areas where oaks are uncommon. It could be argued that a slightly 
                    expanded prehistoric distribution of oak-dominated settings, 
                    to the southwest and to the west, could accommodate as much 
                    as half of the overall distribution of burned rock middens. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Nevertheless, even if we equate oak presence 
                    with acorn processing, it is unlikely that oak accounts for 
                    the entire distribution of burned rock middens. The distribution 
                    to the west and southwest of the Edwards Plateau is clearly 
                    not associated with oak, and by extension, clearly not associated 
                    with acorn processing. Archeologists such as Glenn Goode and 
                    Phil Dering have suggested that sotol and lechuguilla are 
                    the most likely candidates for processing in burned rock middens 
                    in the southern section of the Plateau, as well as to the 
                    west, where sotol and lechuguilla are more common. A number 
                    of ethnographic accounts document the use of these plants, 
                    processed in earth ovens, throughout New Mexico, Northern 
                    Mexico, Arizona, and into California. In addition, charred 
                    agave has been recovered from earth ovens and middens in southwest 
                    and far west Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">While the northern and eastern distribution 
                    of burned rock middens coincides with oak-dominated vegetation 
                    and could be correlated with areas of prehistoric acorn processing, 
                    the area also lies within the southwestern end of the distribution 
                    of geophytes (second map on right). Unlike oak wood, geophytes 
                    could not have been used as a fuel resource and clearly were 
                    being used for food, as indicated by their presence in the 
                    Camp Bowie middens. While the idea that acorns were being 
                    processed at burned rock midden sites cannot be entirely ruled 
                    out, the fact that oak is the major wood identified in Central 
                    Texas burned rock middens suggests that the occasional charred 
                    acorns found in middens may simply represent incidental burning 
                    associated with the use of oak fuel wood. </p>
                  <p class="text">If geophytes&#151;bulbs&#151;rather than acorns, 
                    were the focus of most middens in north-central Texas, why 
                    are there no middens to the north? Eastern camas distribution, 
                    for example, continues to the north, and other geophytes are 
                    certainly in this northern section of the state also. The 
                    distribution of oak continues to the north as well. We have 
                    food and fuel, why don't we have middens? At present, archeologists 
                    have yet to seriously address that question. We can suggest, 
                    however, that if we are correct about geophytes, then the 
                    answer probably lies in considering alternative resources. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Geophytes are &quot;low return&quot; resources, 
                    they require a lot of work for the amount of nutrition they 
                    provide, and potentially were used only for a limited time 
                    during the early spring. We suspect that to the north other 
                    plant resources may have been available that reduced the importance 
                    of geophytes. At present, however, we have no suggestions 
                    as to what these alternative resources might have been. The 
                    absence of burned rock middens in many areas can be explained 
                    by the lack of suitable rock. Earth ovens can be built without 
                    rocks, but they may be harder for archeologists to recognize. 
                  </p>
                    
                  <p class="text">The southwestern distribution of burned rock 
                    middens probably reflects the use of lechuguilla and sotol, 
                    since it is unlikely that high densities of geophytes ever 
                    were present in this relatively dry region. Counties with 
                    the highest percentages of burned rock middens seem to be 
                    on the border between the areas to the west, probably associated 
                    with sotol and agave processing, and the areas to the north. 
                    While these higher percentages might reflect both processing 
                    of sotol and acorns, we would suggest that sotol, lechuguilla, 
                    and geophytes are a more likely mix. </p>
                  <h3>Summing It Up </h3>
                  <p class="text">Between A.D. 750 to 1400, Late Prehistoric peoples 
                    repeatedly came to the Camp Bowie area to process large quantities 
                    of bulbs in earth ovens heated by hot rocks. As favored oven 
                    pits were reused over successive visits, burned rock middens 
                    formed at many places on the landscape. </p>
                  <p class="text">The radiocarbon evidence suggests several periods 
                    of intensive use, separated by periods of lower use frequency. 
                    These patterns may be related to fluctuations in the availability 
                    of what was being processed in the middens, fluctuations in 
                    availability of wood resources, more general changes in settlement 
                    and subsistence, or a combination of these and other factors.</p>
                  <p class="text"> We believe that patterns in fuel wood resources 
                    are a critical component in understanding patterns of midden 
                    reuse. Because wood collecting was so labor intensive and 
                    because wood resources would have been locally depleted over 
                    time, the pit ovens may have been abandoned periodically until 
                    the area's trees had time to rejuvenate. </p>
                  <p class="text">In addition, the differential distribution of 
                    these fuel wood resources may help to account for the strong 
                    association of burned rock middens with oak, an association 
                    that has previously been seen as related to the use of acorns. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Considering the spatial distribution of burned 
                    rock midden sites across the state, it is likely that two 
                    different sets of plant food resources (sotol and geophytes), 
                    each with different spatial distributions, might be the major 
                    food resources processed in middens within the state.</p>
                  <p class="text">There is a strong likelihood that the Camp Bowie 
                    middens were ovens where geophytes were processed. Over hundreds 
                    of years, prehistoric people traveled to the area to harvest 
                    and process bulbs, particularly camas&#151; the principal 
                    resource&#151;during a short seasonal window of time, in the 
                    early spring. The evidence of their culinary handiwork still 
                    remains in the numerous burned rock middens and in an array 
                    of other data. </p>
                  <h3>Managing Camp Bowie's Cultural Resources</h3>
                  <p class="text">Fourteen of the Camp Bowie burned rock midden 
                    sites were determined eligible for the National Register of 
                    Historic Places. For National Guard training purposes, these 
                    sites are considered &quot;sensitive environmental areas&quot; 
                    and are officially &quot;off limits.&quot; These areas are 
                    monitored regularly by TXARNG training site managers and TXARNG 
                    cultural resource staff to ensure that they remain undisturbed. 
                    In the event that training activities or military construction 
                    threatens to impact any of these sites, the state historic 
                    preservation office (Texas Historical Commission) as well 
                    as the Native American tribes that historically lived on what 
                    is now Camp Bowie would be consulted and a reasonable compromise 
                    would be sought among the various interests. </p>
                  <p class="text">Through the cultural resource management process, 
                    the Texas Army National Guard is able to continue its training 
                    programs at Camp Bowie to help ensure national security, while 
                    minimizing the loss of important historic information. This 
                    balanced consideration is precisely the outcome envisioned 
                    by Congress when the National Historic Preservation Act was 
                    passed in 1966.</p>
