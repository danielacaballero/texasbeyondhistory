          <td valign="top" width="372"> <p class="text">A thousand years ago prehistoric 
              hunters and gatherers&#8212;American Indians of unknown tribal affiliation&#8212;frequented 
              the gently rolling hills of what is now Camp Bowie in Brown County 
              near the geographical center of Texas. They were semi-nomadic people 
              who lived in small bands much of the year. They moved from camp 
              to camp across the landscape as the seasons waxed and waned and 
              as the rains came or came not. When they lingered in the Camp Bowie 
              area, they hunted deer and other game, searched for the right kinds 
              of tool-making stones, and gathered fruits, nuts, and seeds. </p>
            <p class="text">In the spring they gathered basketloads of wild onions 
              and other small flowering plant bulbs and baked these in large rock-lined 
              earth ovens built within shallow pits. The rocks they used for cooking 
              broke apart after several heatings and were tossed out from the 
              pit, forming donut-shaped mounded accumulations known to archeologists 
              as <strong>burned rock middens</strong>. Recently, researchers from 
              the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) have explored these 
              ancient campsites to learn more about what it was that drew prehistoric 
              peoples to the area. </p>
            <p class="text">Today Camp Bowie is a 9,297-acre training area for 
              the <strong>Texas Army National Guard</strong>. The original Camp 
              Bowie covered some 119,000 acres during World War II. After the 
              war the land was declared surplus by the Federal government. The 
              National Guard retained 5,000 acres and the remainder was sold to 
              the public (including the entire area where most of war-related 
              training structures had been built). Since the 1940s the National 
              Guard has acquired the remaining 4297 acres. </p>
           
            <p class="text">Camp Bowie is situated in central Texas, just north 
              of the Edwards Plateau. The general vicinity was home to prehistoric 
              peoples for over 12,000 years. For much of the last millennium of 
              the prehistoric era, prior to the historic settlement of Brown County 
              beginning in the mid-1800s, native groups frequented the area, camping 
              near the numerous seasonal streams and springs, hunting game, collecting 
              plants, making tools, and living off of the land. </p>
            <p class="text"> Burned rock middens are the area's most conspicuous 
              reminder of prehistoric life; large piles of fire-fractured rock 
              are easy to spot and resistant to erosion. For decades, these enigmatic 
              accumulations of rock, found throughout much of central and western 
              Texas, have confounded archeologists and landowners alike. But in 
              recent years, new investigative approaches have yielded new insights 
              into their use. At Camp Bowie, archeologists from the <strong>Center 
              for Archaeological Research</strong> (CAR) at UTSA investigated 
              19 burned rock midden sites. The result is a wealth of new information 
              about the prehistoric peoples of the region and the recovery of 
              the <b>largest collection of preserved plant food remains from earth 
              ovens</b> on the edge of the Southern Plains.</p>
            <h3>The Archeology of Camp Bowie </h3>
            <p class="text">Camp Bowie, like all of the nation's military training 
              facilities, must comply with various federal and state laws designed 
              to protect environmental and cultural resources, including important 
              archeological sites. Under the terms of Section 110 of the National 
              Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the Texas Army National Guard 
              must inventory the cultural resources of Camp Bowie (and other facilities) 
              and determine whether any resources present in the area are eligible 
              for the National Register of Historic Places. The idea is to identify 
              those places that contain the most important historic information 
              and try to avoid these during training operations. </p>
            <p class="text">To comply with the law, archeologists working for 
              the Texas Army National Guard (TXARNG) began conducting systematic 
              archeological surveys in 1993. They walked over nearly all of the 
              camp in order to identify and record all prehistoric sites that 
              are present within the camp boundaries. They also recorded a number 
              of historic period structures: old farmsteads that were used before 
              Camp Bowie was established; bridges, dams and other buildings constructed 
              by Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian Conservation 
              Corps laborers; and World War II-era training facilities such as 
              bunkers. </p>
            <p class="text">The National Guard archeologists identified nearly 
              200 archeological sites&#151;most of them dating to prehistoric 
              times&#151;during their survey. Many of these sites required additional 
              investigation to determine their significance, based on the types 
              of artifacts the sites contain, how old they are, and whether the 
              sites would contribute to a better understanding of Texas prehistory. 
              Beginning in 1999, CAR archeologists investigated several dozen 
              sites and carried out small surveys of the remaining portions of 
              Camp Bowie.</p>
            <p class="text">The prehistoric sites on Camp Bowie range in size 
              from large campsites to small camps containing only a sparse <strong>lithic 
              scatter</strong> of broken flint artifacts. These are stone artifacts 
              made of flint (properly termed chert) such as projectile points 
              and knives as well as chipped stone debris resulting from tool manufacture. 
              These small sites were probably occupied for a short time, perhaps 
              just long enough to make dart point, butcher a deer, or camp for 
              the night. </p>
            <p class="text">Other prehistoric sites were places where people stayed 
              for longer periods of time&#8212;perhaps days or sometimes even 
              weeks. Such campsites typically have numerous stone tools as well 
              as remains of cooking features (such as burned rock middens and 
              individual hearths or ovens). It is likely that simple houses (brush 
              huts or wickiups) were built at major campsites, but all traces 
              of these have fallen victim to the ravages of time. </p>
            <p class="text">At Camp Bowie, CAR archeologists focused mainly on 
              the numerous burned rock middens dotting the 9,300-acre property. 
              Ranging in shape from raised mounds to flat, dense, concentrations 
              of burned or fire-cracked stone, these features mark places frequented 
              by prehistoric cooks. The CAR archeologists investigated 19 middens 
              to try to determine what was being cooked in them, in what season 
              (or seasons) they were used, and when these sites were in use. </p>
            <h3>In This Exhibit </h3>
            <p class="text">In the sections below, readers can learn about how 
              prehistoric peoples made use of the Camp Bowie area. <a href="environment.html" class="text">Environments

              change in the region, drawing on several lines of evidence. In <a href="middenwhat.html" class="text">What 
              Is A Burned Rock Midden</a>, readers are taken through an illustrated 
              step-by-step &quot;guide&quot; to midden construction, summarizing 
              current views of how middens formed. <a href="middentell.html" class="text">What 
              the Middens Tell Us</a> draws together findings from the Camp Bowie 
              middens and others across the state. Of particular interest is a 
              close-up look at the bulb foods&#151;ranging from onions to violets&#151;cooked 
              by prehistoric chefs. We'll also speculate as to <b>why</b> these 
              early inhabitants undertook the labor-intensive tasks of digging 
              basketloads of tiny bulbs and hauling tons of rock for cooking them. 
              Finally, we'll look at the spatial distribution of middens across 
              Texas and consider additional evidence of plant food cooking. </p>
