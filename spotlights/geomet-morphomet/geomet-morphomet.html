      <p><em>Archeologists can learn a great deal about how early people lived from their stone tools. Researchers who specialize in stone tool, or lithic, analyses are known as lithicists, and they use a variety of methods ranging from geochemical studies to morphometric approaches to understand past human behavior and technology. Heather Smith, an archeologist and Associate Editor of Texas Beyond History, is a lithicist who uses these approaches in her research on the human occupation of the American continents that occurred at the end of the last Ice Age. By comparing patterns in the shape and technology of stone tools, specifically, early fluted projectile points found across the continent known as Clovis, she hopes to identify the "normative" shape, or mental template, that dictated prehistoric tool manufacture, repair goals and methods. These patterns also may provide evidence of prehistoric human movement or the flow of goods or ideas during the initial occupation of the American continents. In this Spotlight feature, Smith explains one of the methods she uses and offers examples of the more interesting findings in her study of Clovis points, which included  over 100 artifacts from 23 Clovis sites across the U.S. Although more technical than many of our features on Texas Beyond History, it provides insight into some of the current types of quantitative methods being used in stone tool analysis.</em></p>
      <p><strong>By Heather Smith</strong></p>
      <p>The Clovis projectile point represents the earliest and most widespread evidence of a uniform stone technology found in the archeological record of North America. Dating approximately to a 200-500 year time period around 13,000 radiocarbon years before present, their presence at archeological sites across the continent suggests they were left behind by a group or many groups of related peoples who were part of a single culture. These points were used as weapons affixed to the end of spears or lances and in some cases also were used as knives. Clovis points typically have a technologically diagnostic flake scar on the base known as a flute, a characteristic which is found only on projectile points dating to the first few thousand years of the human occupation of the western hemisphere. I have travelled to museums and laboratories across Alaska, Canada, and the continental U.S. to study and assemble a data set of hundreds of fluted points to try to determine if there are patterns in the shape of these artifacts, and if so, whether such patterns are organized geographically, suggesting a direction in which first Americans migrated or transmitted technological information to other early groups.</p>
      <p>
       For the project discussed below, I analyzed a variety of Clovis point assemblages at the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution and at Texas A&M University Center for the Study of the First Americans. However, one of the most important assemblages of Paleoindian artifacts are the Clovis projectile points from the Gault site in central Texas, curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). At the TARL imaging laboratory, I conducted a morphological analysis of a sample of Gault Clovis points using a digital method of morphometric data-capturing and analysis: geometric morphometrics. My findings about this group of Clovis points have been very intriguing.</p>
     
      <h3>Background of  Morphometric Analysis</h3>
      <p>Morphometric analysis is a quantitative method of measuring the form (size with shape) and shape (shape regardless of size) of objects that exist in two or three dimensions for comparative purposes. Morphometric data consists of shape data, which describe an object's geometric properties regardless of location, scale, and orientation. Traditional morphometric data consists of measurements of length or distances (linear and curvilinear), width, mass, area, and angles, as well as indices such as length/width. These types of measurements typically are taken by hand with calipers, rulers, goniometers, or other instruments and can be used in a variety of  analyses. These methods, however, are not able to capture the entire geometry of an object and preserve it throughout analyses. For example, if we are comparing the length/width index of artifacts, we may also wish to simultaneously take into consideration other aspects of shape such as the degree of curve in the tool's blade margins.</p>
      <p>Another way to examine morphology without loosing details of  the original tool shape is to use geometric morphometric analyses. Originally  used in the biological sciences, geometric morphometric techniques are being  widely used today in many studies of anthropological research from shape  analysis of pottery vessels to shape analysis of <em>Australopithecine</em> and early  <em>Homo</em> crania.</p>
<p>To analyze Clovis projectile points, I use an approach known  as <em>landmark</em> geometric morphometrics, which measures shape variation by calculating  the relative positions of coordinate landmarks assigned to important structural  features on each artifact. The features chosen must be uniform points of  reference (i.e., they can be precisely located on every specimen) and  adequately represent the object&rsquo;s structure. In this study, I used a new  approach to assigning landmarks: instead of selecting specific features on the  artifact, I placed a series of landmarks that represent the artifact&rsquo;s outline,  or planview shape, along the entire perimeter of each artifact.</p>
<p>Once the artifact is placed on a grid, the landmarks around  the perimeter can be given Cartesian coordinates (each represents an X and Y  location on the grid) which are used to produce numerical expressions that  describe the shape of each artifact. These expressions can then be analyzed  using multivariate statistics to understand how the differences in shape in a  collection of artifacts might be explained by other variables such as location  or time period, (i.e., their statistical covariation with independent  variables).</p>
<p>The actual process essentially begins by making original  digital photographs of each artifact to document the scale and orientation used  in each photograph. Each photograph is then uploaded into a computer program  called tpsDig that allows a series of landmarks, or &ldquo;dots,&rdquo; to be placed around  the perimeter of the artifact. In geometric morphometrics, there are multiple  kinds of landmarks used for different purposes, and here I refer to the  landmarks placed around the artifact&rsquo;s outline as semi-landmarks. The same  number of semi-landmarks is placed around each artifact so that each of the  semi-landmarks correspond to a semi-landmark located at the same relative  position on each specimen. The tip and basal corners are also given special  landmarks called homologous landmarks, which serve as uniform points of  reference for each projectile point.</p>

      <p>These homologous landmarks are important in the next step of  the analysis known as generalized least squares Procrustes superimposition  (generalized Procrustes analysis), which is conducted in another computer  program, tpsRelw. In this step, each collection, or constellation, of  semi-landmarks around the perimeter of the artifacts plus the three homologous  landmarks at the tip and basal corners are projected onto a grid (i.e., a  Cartesian coordinate system). The next step in Procrustes superimposition is to  move each artifact&rsquo;s constellation of semi-landmarks to the Cartesian origin,  X=0, Y=0, so all are centered on the grid (translation) and are seemingly  &ldquo;stacked&rdquo; one on top of the other, and the three homologous landmarks are in a  sense aligned, or super-imposed (rotation). To align the landmarks representing  the tip and basal corners, images of small artifacts are, for abstract descriptive  purposes, enlarged, and images of large artifacts reduced so that all artifacts  become uniform in size. This step allows the differences in shape to be  isolated and ultimately removes the element of size from each artifact  constellation (scaling).</p>
<p>Size is still a valuable characteristic for comparison,  however, and it is useful to compare the combination of artifact size and shape  in addition to analyses of shape alone. One way that size can be added back  into statistical analysis is to treat it as another independent variable by  calculating a measure of size for each artifact. For example, an independent  measurement of an object&rsquo;s size could be volume, area, or weight. A common  measure of size used in landmark-based geometric morphometric approaches is  <em>centroid size</em>, which is acquired by calculating the square root of the sum of  squared distance of a series of measured landmarks to their common centroid. </p>
<p>As each of the semi-landmarks correspond to a semi-landmark  located at the same position on each artifact, the coordinates for each  corresponding semi-landmark are used to calculate a mean semi-landmark location  for each. The mean landmark locations can be used to produce a mean shape for  the entire data-set.</p>
<p>Next, tpsRelw calculates space between the positions of each  original semi-landmark and the mean position of the corresponding  semi-landmarks for each artifact. Equations are generated to represent the  location of each original semi-landmark relative to the mean semi-landmark&rsquo;s  location. Termed relative warp scores, the collection of scores generated for  each semi-landmark represents the shape of each artifact relative to the mean  shape and can be used in statistical analyses to identify variability or  patterns in shape in a data set.</p>
<p>Another way to describe how this all works is to focus on  the use of the word, <em>warp.</em> It is  useful to imagine that the grid is actually a plane, or plate, and the mean  positions of semi-landmarks used to produce a mean shape rest on a grid that  is comfortably perpendicular, as shown in the figure at right. As the shape of  each artifact varies, represented by the different positions of the  semi-landmarks, you do not see the landmarks actually move on the grid, but the  grid stretches, or warps, to accommodate the different locations of the  original semi-landmarks. The warping or deformation of the grids is represented  by mathematical expressions that describe the bending of the grid axes. When  these are combined with the mean coordinates of each landmark (when grid axes are  in the perpendicular position), they provide mathematical expressions that  describe the positions of each artifact&rsquo;s semi-landmarks relative to the  semi-landmarks&rsquo; mean positions and produce relative warp scores.&nbsp;The  mathematical expressions actually describe the bending of the grid, or bending  energy imposed on the grid, as it accommodates variation in shape. The relative  warp scores describe the way in which each artifact&rsquo;s outline shape varies from  mean shape and can be used as principal components for use in multivariate  statistical analyses. Another advantage of geometric morphometrics is that you  also can generate visual output of the shape differences represented by the  relative warp scores.</p>
<h3>Geometric Morphometrics: A Case Study</h3>
      <p>In  a 2010 study, I evaluated a fluted projectile point sample that included  artifacts from sites that were either confidently dated to the Clovis time  period or were from cache sites comprised of morphologically diagnostic Clovis  points. Questions I hoped to address were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Can geometric morphometric shape analysis identify major  factors of variability in Clovis point shape across North America?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is variability in Clovis point morphology geographically  patterned? 
        </li>
        <li>
        Does a normative (prescribed or standardized) point shape remain  after episodes of resharpening?
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>To be included in the analysis, projectile points had to be  complete (unbroken) to guarantee that uniform features were available to place  homologous landmarks (i.e., they needed to have a tip and both basal corners), and they  had to have been recovered from archeological sites either associated with a  reliable radiocarbon date corresponding to the Clovis time period or included  in a cache with diagnostic Clovis-type artifacts. The final data set included  over 100 artifacts from 23 Clovis sites from across the U.S.</p>
<p>Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out  using the relative warp scores generated from geometric morphometric data to  test for variability in shape within the entire data-set. Results indicated there  were significant shape differences between regions, and a significant dichotomy  was apparent between regions in the East and regions in the West. In other  words, this variability in shape was not random in the data set but patterned  geographically, with certain shape characteristics specific to region. This  pattern is visible in the dendrogram generated in multivariate cluster analysis  shown at right. </p>
<p>Clovis points in the northwest (colored blue in the map at  right) were found to have more shape characteristics in common with Clovis  points from the more southwestern sites (red), which includes the Gault site,  than any of these western sites have with sites in the northeast (green).  Clovis points from the Gault site were found to be closely associated with  other points from the southwest region. This could suggest that these sites  were occupied by a single group of people, who moved long distances across the  landscape, or by closely related groups of people who used the same methods to  manufacture Clovis points. </p>
<p>One interesting aspect of the relationship between southwest  and northwest sites is that many of the latter are cache sites, where a number  of Clovis points were stashed, possibly for future use. Many of these cached  points appear to be made of the same types of Texas tool stone, such as  Alibates chert from the Texas panhandle and other more southerly sources.  According to recent research by lithicists conducting geochemical analysis of  stone sources, it is highly likely that the same peoples who occupied the  southwestern sites like Gault travelled hundreds of kilometers north across the  Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Front to the sites in the northwest.</p>
<p>The points from the northeast cluster in another branch of  the dendrogram. This suggests that by the time Clovis technology reached this  area of the U.S. and Canada, the shape of Clovis points had changed. This  change in tool shape may have occurred when western-originating populations  encountered new territory in the northeast and needed to change their  technological standards to accommodate different environments with new types of  stone, plant resources, or prey animals. Alternatively, if a population of people  already inhabited the area, it is possible that the technology was transmitted  from peoples in the west to peoples in the northeast, and shape change occurred  during the process of transmission.</p>
<p>The three clusters also suggest that Clovis peoples were  preserving a standardized point shape as they resharpened and refurbished  projectile points. This is especially apparent in the northwest cluster  (outlined in blue in the figure, above right) and the greater western cluster,  where cached points and heavily resharpened points were assigned to the same  cluster. The cached points represent pristine specimens, many of which are in  early stages of their use life (e.g., Drake, Anzick, and Fenn), whereas points  from such sites as Dent, Gault, and Naco likely experienced multiple episodes  of resharpening and refurbishment. Although discarded near the end of their  use-life, these points retain enough specific shape characteristics to be  clustered with the more pristine cached points. It appears, then, that Clovis-point  manufacturers did not unsystematically resharpen broken points, but imposed a  normative, or preconceived, shape as they resharpened and repaired points  throughout their use-lives.</p>
<p>As an analytical tool, geometric morphometrics describes  shape variation and generates variables for statistical analysis from a series  of coordinates that capture the geometry of the entire structure being studied, enabling  consideration of entire shape throughout analysis. Not only does geometric  morphometrics allow examination of shape variation in a data set, but it also  can be used to evaluate how differences in shape co-vary with other variables  such as environmental and geographical factors.</p>
<p>There are multiple approaches to this method, such as  elliptical fourier in addition to landmark placement, and analyses of  3-dimensional representations of objects have also become common. There are  many software package available as well. While this analysis used the  tps-series of software, other high quality packages include MorphoJ, IMP, and  CoordGen. </p>
