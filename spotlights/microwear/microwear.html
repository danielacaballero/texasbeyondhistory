TARL analyst Marilyn Shoberg examines stone tools under a high powered microscope, searching for traces of past use&#8212;striations and residues typically not apparent to the naked eye. By comparing these wear patterns with those on experimental tools, she is able to link them with  tool actions, such as scraping and cutting. </em></p>
      <p><em>Much of her research has focused  on some very ancient tools&#8212;those from the Gault site in central Texas.  It has attracted national and international                       attention because of the wealth of new information it has yielded, particularly on Clovis                       culture.  Shoberg's work at TARL has involved acquiring and analyzing a set of experimental tools in order to have a comparative basis for analyzing dozens of archeological specimens from that site. In this feature, she discusses what can be learned from microwear analysis and the processes involved in this type of inquiry.</em></p>
      <p><strong>By Marilyn Shoberg</strong></p>
      <p> Some of the stone artifacts in an  archeological assemblage are formal tools that have recognizable shapes such as  projectile points, bifaces, or endscrapers. Many more artifacts appear to have  been used, however, and unless we look at them under the microscope we can only  guess at what their function may have been. </p> 
      <p>
When  a stone tool is used, the edge is gradually worn away by the loss of flakes and  abrasion. The surface is modified by contact with the worked material so  that it appears shiny or polished.&nbsp; Microwear analysis is a systematic  process of recording wear traces such as edge flaking, the surface  characteristics of polish, and the orientation of striations on a stone tool in  order to determine how that tool was used. </p> <p>
The  research microscope used at TARL for this analysis is an Olympus BH2 reflected  light microscope with Nomarski optics.&nbsp;Observations are made at  magnifications from 50X to 500X.&nbsp; Images of potentially diagnostic wear  traces are captured with a digital Moticam camera.</p>
<p>
  Microwear  analysts learn how to identify the various attributes of wear traces by looking  at experimental tools used in many different tasks on a wide variety of  materials.&nbsp; It is absolutely essential for every analyst to do experiments  and to acquire a reference collection of tools used in tasks relevant to  prehistoric human behavior.&nbsp; The comparative collection of experimental  tools we have at TARL is a terrific asset for analysis and teaching.&nbsp; It  has grown from the work of many former students here at UT, archeologists and  friends of archeology.&nbsp; The collection includes tools used on plant  materials, several kinds of wood, bone, antler, elephant ivory, hide, and  butchering a variety of animals. </p> 
<p>
In addition to a large number  of Clovis tools from the Gault Site, I have analyzed artifacts from a number of  CRM projects in Texas, and sites in Arizona, Illinois, New Hampshire, Kentucky  and Belize. </p> <p>
In  archeology we attempt to understand past human behavior from material culture; however only a very small fraction of that material culture survives.&nbsp; The  things that people made from perishable organic materials such as plants, wood,  bone, and skin are for the most part missing from the archeological  record.&nbsp; The fascinating aspect of microwear analysis is that the tools  used in the manufacture of the &ldquo;missing majority&rdquo; of that perishable material  culture provide clues to the kinds of things people were making at particular  places. </p> <p>
Among  the most interesting tools I have looked at are a small Clovis age flake used  to incise bone, tools used to pierce animal skin, perhaps in the manufacture of  clothing or shelter, and small prismatic blade fragments used in fine cutting  or scraping tasks on grass, reed and wood.&nbsp; Sometimes you find an example  of a recycled tool like a used-up projectile point re-purposed as a scraper or  abrader on animal skin.
