      <p>Mounted warrior, probably Kiowa, wearing a tall feather  headpiece with a cape of trailing feathers, fringed moccasins, and a striped  blanket. His elaborate regalia includes a staff, or lance, bent into a hooked handle and a  serrated wooden club. According to correspondence between Barbara LaMont and  Father Peter Powell, the distinctive bent staff and serrated wooden club can  be associated with several tribes including the Cheyenne Elk Scraper Society  and the Kiowa Crazy Dog Society.  Father Powell also noted that the fringed  moccasins, though common to the Kiowa, were worn  only by Cheyenne Dog Soldiers,  who would not have carried a bent staff. The horse is ornamented with a sash around its  neck and ceremonial&nbsp; paint markings;  its tail is tied for battle and has a  feather fan attached. A feather and foxtail hang  from its head and bridle.&nbsp; The painted markings  on the horse are thought to correlate to the number of battles it has seen. TARL Archives.</p>
