    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" --> Close up view of two clusters of Rabdotus land 
	snails and various other artifacts including bone fragments, stone tools, and a triangular pendant 
	made from mussel shell.  These were part of the Feature 7 "living surface." The land snail cluster 
	near the bottom of the photo contained 36 adult snails.<br><br>
	Archeologists have long debated whether snails were eaten or attracted by camp debris, but the latter 
	possibility has been laid to rest by several careful studies.  Land snails were obviously a common 
	food item as they occur by the hundreds and thousands in direct association with camping debris at
	 many prehistoric sites.  In fact, in unexplored areas of the South Texas Plains, the first clue that 
	 archeologists often have that an archeological site exists is spotting land snail concentrations - 
	 white specks standing out on bare gray or tan soil.  Based on the excavated sample and site area, 
	 Black calculated  that the Hinojosa site contained well over 200,000 snails.  The small clusters, 
	 he reasoned, could represent the discarded contents of individual containers have of snail soup. 
	 Heat is necessary to release the small invertebrates (the snails) from their protective shells and 
	 it is reasonable to suggest that snails were components of soup or stews.
