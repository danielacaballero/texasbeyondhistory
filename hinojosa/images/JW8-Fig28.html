    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->Plan map of the main excavation area and its archeological features (F.#).  The 
					 clusters of rock and charcoal are obvious cooking facilities - small pit hearths (e.g., Feature 5) 
					 and somewhat larger clusters (such as Feature 6) where small earth ovens and other cooking 
					 arrangements were likely built.  The bone clusters (such as Feature 10) are thought to be purposeful 
					 deposits of fragmented bones placed in simple holes or in small erosional gulleys.  Black 1986: Figure 28.<br>
					 <br>
					 This pattern of 
					 bone disposal suggests that people camping here sometimes kept a tidy camp, perhaps when they were 
					 staying for extended stays of several weeks or more.  The living surface reflects a much less tidy 
					 pattern - a large concentrated area of scattered artifacts (stone tools, animal bones, and pottery 
					 sherds among them). Perhaps this was an area of the camp where various activities took place.  
					 Confidently interpreting such complex patterns is difficult, especially because we suspect the 
					 patterns formed from repeated camping episodes that may have taken place over decades or even several 
					 centuries. <br>
