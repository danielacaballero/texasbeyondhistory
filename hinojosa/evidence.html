	  <p>The archeological evidence recovered from the Hinojosa site is quite robust and consists of many 
	  different kinds of data including artifacts, soil samples, notes, drawings, photographs, and so on.  
	  Processing these data – washing, labeling, inventorying, organizing, and preparing for analysis and 
	  long-term curation – took months of work at the CAR laboratory at UTSA.  The analysis and reporting 
	  continued intermittently for several more years.  Most of the work was done in San Antonio but 
	  certain materials, such as the animal bones and the charred plant remains, were sent to specialists 
	  at Texas A&M and elsewhere for analysis.  The results are reported in considerable detail in the 
	  site report.  The following brief summaries have links to details from the report.</p>
	  <h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>
	<p>Three types of archeological features were recognized at the Hinojosa site: rock/charcoal clusters, 
	bone clusters, and living surfaces.</p>
	<p>Two<strong> living surfaces</strong> were sampled at the site, one beside the 1975 bone bed and one that covered much 
	of the Wagon Trail Area. A living surface is a thin layer of concentrated debris – artifacts, bones, 
	snails, etc. – though to represent materials that accumulated on the surface of an active area of the 
	camp.  Among the artifacts were many that were laying flat upon an apparent surface.  Cooking and disposal 
	features occurred within or adjacent to the living surfaces as well as smaller concentrations that seem to 
	represent particular activities.</p>
	<p>Five clusters of rock and/or charcoal were documented and lumped together under the general term 
	  <strong>“rock/charcoal cluster.”</strong> Three of the five were little more than suggestive clusters that did not 
	preserve definitive evidence of their original form and function, although they  probably  resulted from  some sort of cooking activity.  Fortunately,  two features were well-preserved 
	cooking facilities of contrasting scale.</p>
	<p><strong>Feature 5</strong> was a small pit hearth filled with ash and charcoal that measured about 18” across and 
	6” deep.  The feature had evidence that it had been used several times and contained a fire hot enough 
	to bake and discolor the clay-rich soil around it.  There were bone fragments of large and small 
	mammals and a fish as well as an unidentified charred seed fragment.  The pit itself was filled with 
	ash, suggesting the fire it last contained was allowed to burn itself out and was left undisturbed.  
	Small pockets of bone and baked clay adjacent to the pit suggest the hearth was cleaned out several 
	times.  Feature 5 is about the size of a small fire built inside a hut or windbreak to keep people 
	warm and cook small meals.  Although no direct evidence of an encompassing structure was detected, 
	the area containing Feature 5 was relatively free of debris, a pattern that would be expected inside 
	a dwelling.</p> 
	<p>In contrast, <strong>Feature 6</strong> is a larger and more complicated cooking arrangement that saw repeated and 
	varied use.  The feature included a circular pattern of cooking stones adjacent to a small pit and 
	outlying “lobes” of ash and charcoal.  The pattern of rocks probably represents the heating element 
	of a small earth oven, while the pit is similar to Feature 5 and the lobes seem to represent cooking 
	debris that was cleaned out of one or both adjacent cooking areas.  Taken together, the pattern is 
	that of an outdoor cooking facility used repeatedly to bake plants, cook meat, and perhaps boil up a 
	small batch of snail soup.</p>
	<p>Five <strong>bone clusters</strong> were documented during the 1981 work, smaller versions of the bone bed discovered 
	in 1975.  All six clusters (including the bone bed) are characterized as sets of mostly fragmented and 
	sometimes burned bones of various kinds of animals (large and small, different preferred habitats, 
	different hunting methods).  Almost all of the leg bones of the hoofed animals were highly fractured 
	while the bones were fresh, a pattern consistent with marrow extraction and grease rendering. Some bones 
	also have cut marks resulting from butchering with a sharp stone tool.  Taken together, the bone clusters 
	are interpreted as intentional discard piles of bone refuse disposed of after butchering, bone/meat
	 processing, and consumption.  Such an efficient and rather tidy disposal system might be expected in a 
	 base camp were people were living for some time.</p>
	 <p><strong>Feature 9</strong> illustrates all of the telling characteristics of the Hinojosa bone clusters. This 
	 discrete linear concentration included the bones of six species from diverse habitats – bison, 
	 javelina, turtle, three different kinds of rodents, and deer or antelope. Most of the bones were 
	 broken while fresh and/or have cut marks – obvious signs of butchering – and some of the bones are 
	 burned.  The condition of the bones is pristine and the linear arrangement is consistent with the 
	 idea of using a small erosional gully as a convenient disposal area.</p>

	 <h3><strong>Stone Artifacts</strong></h3>
	 <p>At many, perhaps most, prehistoric sites in the South Texas Plains, cooking stones (burned rocks)
	  , stone tools, and tool-making debris are about the only kinds of artifacts that survive.  Thus, 
	  prehistoric archeologists often become “lithic” experts and master the intricacies of stone tool 
	  technology to try and understand how tools were made, what they were used for, how old they are, 
	  and how they relate to those found in other sites.  Although the Hinojosa site had a more interesting 
	  and informative variety of preserved evidence than most sites in the region – with animal bones at 
	  the top of the list – there were plenty of stone tools.</p>
	  <p>Two things make the Hinojosa lithics stand out as a particularly informative set of artifacts: 
	  they date to a narrow period of time and every single one of them was brought to the site from 
	  elsewhere.</p>
	  <p>The only nearby stones are small chunks of calcum carbonate and hard caliche exposed in eroded 
	  spots and on the ridge across the creek; these were used as cooking stones even though they are 
	  less than ideal for that purpose. The closest source areas for tool-making stones are the gravel 
	  bars of the Nueces River, some 20 miles to the east-northeast, and the ancient hilltop gravel 
	  deposits that occur some 30 miles to the northwest in northern Duval County. From these sources, 
	  the inhabitants of the Hinojosa site carried back chert (flint), petrified wood, quartzite, 
	  sandstone, and various less common types of rocks.  Sometimes these materials were brought to 
	  the site as finished tools, but often as cobbles and unfinished chunks from which they fashioned 
	  into serviceable tools back in camp.   This pattern is one of the supporting lines of evidence that 
	  show that the Hinojosa site was more than just a temporary overnight camp.</p>
	  <p>Virtually all of the stone artifacts from the site are believed to date to roughly A.D., 1300-1400 
	  during the early part of the Toyah horizon.  The bulk of the stone artifacts are tool-making debris
	   – flakes, cores, and fragments.  Read the first part of the <a href="images/Black-1986-Artifact-Analy.pdf" target="_blank">artifact analysis chapter	   <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Artifact Analysis pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> to learn more about the raw materials, classification 
	   systems, and tool-making debris.</p>
	   <p>Most of the almost-finished manufacturing failures, and worn-out finished artifacts are 
	   characteristic of the Toyah toolkit.  Detailed analyses were carried out on three distinctive 
	   types of Toyah stone tools: Perdiz arrow points (killing tools), beveled knives (butchering tools),
	   and end scrapers (hide-working tools). </p>
	   <p>The <strong>Perdiz arrow</strong> point is the quintessential Toyah artifact and some 100 recognizable specimens 
	   were recovered in the 1981 dig.  These thin, lightweight points average less than 1” long, but were 
	   carefully shaped into sharp triangular blades with pointed contracting stems.  There were a few 
	   other kinds of arrow points from the site, but most of these were atypical specimens having 
	   expanding stems or triangular shapes that were used by Toyah peoples.</p>
	   <p>To learn more, you can read several sections from the report, <a href="images/Black-1986-ArrowPts.pdf" target="_blank">arrow points 
		   <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Arrow Points pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> 
		 and <a href="images/Black-1986-Perdiz-special.pdf" target="_blank">Perdiz point special studies
		 <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Perdiz Points pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>.  The 
		 large sample of Perdiz points and the many probable Perdiz-point fragments, were used to study breakage patterns and to evaluate a fascinating, but flawed hypothesis that projectile point 
	   dimensions could be used to estimate age.</p>
	   <p><strong>Beveled knives</strong> are butchering and skinning tools that started out tool life as large, thin, 
	   symmetrical bifaces with wide blades.  Many use episodes and many miles later, they were discarded 
	   as small, asymmetrical, and often broken remnants.  Throughout their “use life” the knives were 
	   repeatedly resharpened by removing small retouch flakes from one direction along one blade edge 
	   and from the opposite direction on the other blade edge.  This “patterned maintenance” gave the 
	   tool it’s distinctive “beveled” appearance (and name).  This resharpening kept the knives 
	   serviceable for the maximum amount of time.  In most of the South Texas Plains, large thin 
	   pieces of chert suitable for making knives were very hard to come by and would have been 
	   extremely valuable possessions.  It is not surprising that the only beveled knives found at 
	   Hinojosa were small broken remnants – spent tools.  Learn more by reading the report's <a href="images/Black-1986-Beveled.pdf" target="_blank">beveled knife 
	    <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Beveled Knives pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>section.</p>
	   <p><strong>End or hide scrapers</strong> were used to render animal hides into useable leather by removing the fat 
	   and gunk adhering to the inside of fresh skins.  These unifacial tools aren’t unique to Toyah 
	   culture, but they are always found at Toyah sites, often in considerable numbers.  In contrast 
	   to both Perdiz points and beveled knives, both of which take skilled craftsmanship to make, end 
	   scrapers are easily fashioned from thick flakes.  Suitable flake in hand, all one has to do is 
	   quickly removed a series of retouch flakes from one end to form a circular edge.  It can be done 
	   in less than a minute if you know what you are doing, something even a neophyte flintknapper can 
	   accomplish.   Learn more by reading the report's <a href="images/Black-1986-EndScrapers.pdf" target="_blank">endscraper <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Endscrapers pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> section.</p>

	<h3><strong>Modified Bones and Shells</strong></h3>
	<p>Animal bones, marine shells, and freshwater clam shells were fashioned into tools and ornaments.  
	Four deer ulna (fore-arm bone) tools were recovered, three with blunt tips that appear to be 
	flintknapping tools and one with a pointed and polished tip that is likely a basketry weaving tool.  
	A bone needle fragment may be a sewing tool.  Polished bone beads were made from the leg bones of 
	large birds (turkeys or cranes, perhaps).   The freshwater and marine shell fragments mainly seem to 
	be ornaments such as beads and pendants and debris leftover from ornament-making.  Although the marine 
	shells fragments were not numerous they are one of several indications of coastal connections, which 
	is not surprising since the coast is only a two-day walk away.</p>
	
	<h3><strong>Ceramics</strong></h3>
	<p>Bone-tempered earthenware pottery is also one of the hallmarks of Toyah culture.  Over 700 pottery 
	sherds were found at Hinojosa, but most were tiny fragments less than an inch across.  Apart from 
	several fragments of a ceramic pipe bowl and one piece of a figurine, all of the sherds are pieces of 
	utilitarian pottery including water jars (ollas), bowls, and cylindrical jars.  Interestingly, as 
	much as a quarter of the pottery was decorated with either a red ocher wash (“fugitive red”) or 
	asphaltum, although the latter may have also been used to mend cracks.   Although sharing some traits 
	(such as the asphaltum) with the coastal pottery known as Rockport ware, the Hinojosa ceramics are 
	part of the bone-tempered pottery tradition shared by all Toyah sites.</p>
	<p>The small figurine fragment is noteworthy.  This thumb or cigar-shaped cylindrical fragment is 
	smoothed and has tiny punctuates (holes) in the finished end.  Ceramic figurines are rare in the 
	region, but known from occasional finds in the Coastal Bend area.</p>

	<h3>Animal Bones</h3>
	<p>The abundant “faunal evidence” – animal bones – sets the Hinojosa site apart from most 
	   prehistoric sites in the South Texas Plains.  The faunal assemblage is one of the largest 
	   and best preserved collections from any archeological site in the region. These bones represent 
	   an incredible diversity of species and habitats –  fishes, birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals.  
	   Of these, mammals are by far the most common.  Forty-five taxonomic groups (taxa) representing at 
	   least 31 different species were documented. This diverse array of animals shows that four 
	   ecological habitats were used: aquatic, well-drained prairie grassland, poorly drained grassland, 
	   and woodlands.</p>
	   <p>Two zooarcheologists (the specialists who study animal bones from archeological sites) studied 
	   the Hinojosa materials.  Billy Davidson of Austin identified the bones from the 1975 work and Dr. 
	   D. Gentry Steele from Texas A&M identified those from the 1981 season.  Learn more by studying the 
	   list of the identified <a href="images/Black-1986-Faunal.pdf" target="_blank">faunal remains <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Faunal Remains pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> from the site report.</p>
	   <p>Here are a few of the big findings from the bones.  The two most numerous groups of animals were 
	   hoofed animals (artiodactyls) and rabbits (lagomorphs).  White-tailed deer were by far the most 
	   common bones, making it clear that this was the main prey.  The bones of two other large 
	   artiodactyls, pronghorn antelopes and bison, were also fairly common, but were much less so than 
	   deer.  All three of these species were well known from other Late Prehistoric sites in the region.  
	   More surprising was the finding of a fragment of the jawbone of a collared peccary (javelina), a 
	   species that some authorities believed had only entered the region during historic times.   The 
	   peccary jawbone at Hinojosa was part of a very tight discard cluster of butchered animal bones, 
	   leaving no doubt that the species was present and hunted in the area at least 600 years ago.</p>
	   <p>While the hoofed animals provided the lion’s share of the meat, two species of rabbits were also 
	   common – black-tailed jackrabbits and desert cottontails as well as many even smaller mammals such 
	   as rats, voles and ground squirrels.  The collective dietary importance of these creatures along 
	   with several kinds of snakes, turtles, frogs, birds, and fish may have been as important as the 
	   larger mammals, especially because these smaller animals  could have been trapped, gathered, 
	   or hunted by children and women near to the camp.   Big game hunting success is usually hard to 
	   predict, whereas small creatures are more numerous and easier to encounter.</p>
	   <p>The most common creature is actually  the <em>Rabdotus</em> land snail, an 
	   invertebrate about the size of a thimble or a grape.  Archeologists have debated whether snails 
	   were eaten by people or just attracted by camp debris, but the latter possibility has been laid to 
	   rest by several careful studies.  Land snails were obviously a common food item as they occur by 
	   the hundreds and thousands in direct association with camping debris at many prehistoric sites.  
	   In fact, in unexplored areas of the South Texas Plains, the first clue that archeologists often 
	   have that an archeological site exists are visible concentrations of snails – white specks stand 
	   out on exposed ground.</p>
	   <p>Based on the excavated sample and known site area, the Hinojosa site is estimated to have 
	   contained well over 200,000 snails.  And most were large adult specimens, not the mix of juvenile 
	   and adult snails that would be expected in a natural population.  They were found scattered within 
	   the general debris, as dense patches, and in small, tight clusters.  The small clusters could 
	   represent the discarded contents of individual containers (such as a gourd or earthenware bowl) 
	   of snail soup. Heat is necessary to release the small invertebrates (the snails) from their 
	   protective shells and it is reasonable to suggest that snails were components of soup or stews.  
	   The large numbers are somewhat deceptive, as takes many snails to amount to much food and snails 
	   rank as only a relatively minor food source.</p>
	   <p>Mussel shells (freshwater clam shells) were also found at the site in moderately large numbers, 
	   but never as dense accumulations.  The clams are edible, but would have been a minor supplemental 
	   food source.  Several ornaments (pendants) were found at Hinojosa that were fashioned from mussel 
	   shells.   But the most important aspect of the site’s mussel shells is what they say about 
	   Chiltipin Creek.  Several different species were present and these have very particular habitats.  
	   Harold Murray of Trinity University in San Antonio identified the mussels and reasoned that 
	   Chiltipin Creek had been a constantly running shallow stream, that possibly flowed from an artesian 
	   source (spring-fed) and had a muddy or muddy sand bottom.</p>

	<h3><strong>Plant Remains</strong></h3>
	<p>Plant remains are rarely preserved at open campsites, but many charred plant fragments were 
	recovered at Hinojosa. Most of those that were recovered  were pieces of wood charcoal representing fuel used for cooking and 
	warmth fires.  These generally small chunks were mainly spotted in the ground during the excavations and 
	saved for identification and dating. Charcoal was concentrated in the cooking features (“rock/charcoal 
	clusters”).</p>
	<p>In addition, there were also a few charred seeds from edible plants recovered from feature “matrix” 
	(fine sediment) samples and two sets of soil samples collected as columns.  Two dozen 2-liter 
	(1.8 quart) matrix and soil samples were processed using an experimental water separation (flotation) 
	system at the CAR laboratory.  Unfortunately, the results suffered from inexperience and inadequate 
	analysis time.  In hindsight, a more rigorous program of soil sampling and flotation would have almost 
	certainly yielded more charred plant remains, especially seeds and perhaps nut and root fragments.</p>
	<p>The plant remains were identified under the microscope – wood charcoal pieces are snapped to 
	examine the growth rings and morphological patterns, which are distinctive for certain species.  
	The wood charcoal and the charred seeds are identified by comparison to modern samples of known 
	species.  The “macrobotantical” work was done by Richard Holloway at Texas A&M.  </p>
	<p>The many wood charcoal fragments that were identified were overwhelming dominated by fragments of 
	mesquite and acacia.  Small fragments of these related trees are very difficult to tell apart and both 
	are common in the region and local area.  Some fragments were definitely mesquite and it is likely 
	that this was the dominate fuel type.  Other fuel woods identified in smaller numbers were hackberry 
	and persimmon.</p>
	<p>The charred seeds identified that are likely part of the diet were persimmon and chenopodium 
	(goosefoot) and possibly sunflower.  Chenopodium and sunflower have starchy seeds and both plants 
	were domesticated in the Eastern Woodlands beginning as early as 1500 B.C.  But the seeds from 
	Hinojosa are probably from wild species. Persimmon fruit ripens in the fall and is tart, but edible.  
	These three plants doubtlessly represent only a tiny fraction of the plants that were gathered and 
	used for food and medicinal purposes and it is indeed regrettable that a more thorough job of searching 
	for charred edible plant fragments was not accomplished.</p> 

	<h3><strong>Radiocarbon Dating</strong></h3>
	<p>The large samples of well-preserved wood charcoal were ideal for radiocarbon dating.  The 
	conventional radiocarbon dating method used for the Hinojosa samples requires relatively large 
	samples, which were obtained from four different features.  Twelve samples were assayed.  
	Unfortunately, the radiocarbon dating of the site was beset by problems, including laboratory 
	processing errors and inconsistent results from split samples that should have yielded identical 
	results.</p>
	<p>One assay was rejected because of a processing error.   Of the remaining 11 assays, 7 overlap 
	between A.D. 1350-1400, which falls squarely within the time frame expected on the basis of the site’s 
	many Toyah artifacts.  The four other assays, including two that had paired samples dating to the 
	expected time range, dated 300-700 years earlier.   Although it is possible that these early dates 
	reflect an otherwise undetected earlier period of site use, this is considered unlikely.  Three of 
	the early dates came from Feature 6, a very well preserved cooking facility, but the same feature 
	yielded two dates that fall in the expected range.  The likelihood that this cooking facility was 
	used on two separate occasions 300-700 years apart is considered remote.</p>
	<p>In the end, the radiocarbon dating problems were never fully resolved.  These problems are carefully
	 discussed in the report's <a href="images/Black-1986-RadCar.pdf" target="_blank">radiocarbon assays<img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Radio Carbon Assays pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> section.  In hindsight, it is unfortunate 
	 that the modern AMS radiocarbon dating technique was not widely available at the time the work was 
	 done.  This technique allows a small, wood charcoal fragment of an identified species (or even tiny charred seeds) 
	 to be dated and has become the dating method of choice in archeology.</p> 

	 

	

	<h3><strong>Other Special Studies:  Phytoliths and Soils Chemistry</strong></h3>
	<p>Two special studies were undertaken that may be of interest to students of archeology.  One was an 
	analysis of phytoliths, durable microscopic biosilica “copies” of plant cells that are formed by 
	silica absorbed from groundwater.   Opal phytoliths, as they are often called, have distinctive 
	three-dimensional shapes unique to some plant species and families. They are extracted from soil 
	samples using a laborious chemical separation process. This promising, but challenging line of 
	research allows skilled analysts to reconstruct past environmental conditions.  It has been 
	successfully developed and applied in some parts of the world.  Unfortunately, the pioneering 
	research done in the 1980s in southern Texas by Ralph Robinson, then a graduate student at Texas A&M, has not 
	yet been followed by other researchers.  Robinson’s preliminary study of samples from the 
	Hinojosa site was one of only several analyses that he completed before leaving the discipline.  
	Thus, the results of the Hinojosa study are promising, but must be 
	regarded as provisional.</p>
	<p>The Hinojosa phytoliths included several different types of grasses including tall grasses, short 
	grasses, and, most intriguingly, several genera of the Pooideae subfamily of grasses.  Pooideae 
	grasses are cool season grasses that thrive in relatively moist conditions.   They are present in the 
	region today, but are relatively uncommon.  The presence of numerous Pooideae phytoliths in soil samples 
	from the Toyah occupation zone at the Hinojosa site was interpreted as indicating that the prevailing 
	climate was somewhat wetter and possibly cooler than today.  To learn more, read the report’s 
	<a href="images/Black-1986-Biosil.pdf" target="_blank">phytolith study <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Phytolith Study pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>.  </p>
	<p>An experimental soils chemistry study was done of phosphate levels within and outside the 
	intensively occupied area at the Hinojosa site.  This work was done by Black as part of a two-semester 
	graduate class in archaeometry taught at UTSA by a retired chemist, Donald R. Lewis.  Archaeometry is 
	the application of hard science techniques to archeological materials.   Under Lewis’ supervision,
	 Black analyzed the phosphate levels of soil samples from the site that were systematically collected 
	 within and outside of archeological features.  Phosphate levels have long been known to be influenced 
	 by and often concentrated by human activities such as the accumulation of organic wastes as might be 
	 expected from plant and animal processing.  The provisional results indicated that several of the 
	 cooking hearths at the site had very localized, very high concentrations of phosphate.  Like the 
	 phytolith study, the results of the soils chemistry study were intriguing, but were followed by 
	 little additional research in the region.  To learn more, read the report’s <a href="images/Black-1986-SoilChem.pdf" target="_blank">soils chemistry study <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Soil Chemistry pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>.</p>

Pooideae grasses are cool season grasses that thrive in relatively moist conditions. Their presence suggests that the prevailing climate was somewhat wetter and possibly cooler than today.
