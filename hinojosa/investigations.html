					  <p>The Hinojosa site was found in 1974 by archeologists from the Center for 
							  Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio (CAR-UTSA)
							  .  They were surveying several properties that were to be affected by flood 
							  control projects planned by the Soil Conservation Service. The campsite was 
							  designated 41JW8, the 8th formally recorded archeological site in Jim Wells 
							  County. The site was later named the Clemente and Herminia Hinojosa site 
							  after the former landowners, but became known to archeologists simply as 
							  the Hinjosa site or just JW8.</p>
							  <p>The following year a research team from CAR-UTSA spent a week evaluating 
							  the site by digging a dozen 2-x-2-m test pits.  This testing revealed what 
							  appeared to be a single-component site (i.e., one occupation period) 
							  dating to around A.D. 1300-1400.  Preservation conditions were found to be 
							  unusually good for the region; animal bones in particular were very numerous 
							  and in excellent condition. The finding of a large cluster of bison and other 
							  animal bones termed the “bone bed” led CAR Director, Dr. Thomas R. Hester, 
							  to hypothesize that the Hinojosa site was mainly a bison hunting camp 
							  seasonally occupied during the winter to early spring over a few years or 
							  decades at the most.</p>
							  <p>The site was recognized as an important and significant locality that 
							  preserved evidence of a little-known chapter of prehistoric life.   
							  Because of its research potential, the Hinojosa site was nominated and 
							  subsequently placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Because 
							  the planned flood control work and long-term inundation threatened the site, 
							  the National Park Service’s Interagency Archeological Services-Denver 
							  contracted with UTSA-CAR to carry out additional investigations.</p>
							  <p>In the fall of 1981 and early winter of 1982 a crew of six archeologists 
							  from CAR-UTSA carried out major excavations over a several months.  
							  TBH editor Steve Black, then a young professional archeologist and 
							  part-time graduate student at UTSA, ran the dig.  The analysis and 
							  reporting of the site was Black’s Master’s thesis project and was 
							  published by the CAR-UTSA in 1986.  Sections of the report are linked 
							  throughout this exhibit. </p>
							  <p>To learn more about the history of the work at the site, read Chapter 
							  1 of the site report,<a href="images/Black-1986-Investigations.pdf" target="_blank"> Introduction <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Introduction pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>.</p>
							  <p>The excavations were aimed at addressing a series of research problems or 
							  questions, some of which targeted basic site characteristics (limits, depth, 
							  dating, etc.) and some targeted narrow site-specific questions (nature of 
							  the bone bed, seasonality, bison hunting hypothesis, etc.).  The big-picture 
							  problem was to explain how the Hinojosa site fit within regional Late 
							  Prehistoric cultural patterns.  By today’s standards in 2006, the research 
							  design was not very sophisticated, but for its day it was a useful and 
							  fairly explicit set of research problems.  To learn more about the research 
							  design and strategy, read Chapter 2 of the site report,<a href="images/Black-1986-ReDes.pdf" target="_blank"> Research Design<img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Research Design pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>.</p>
							  <p>We began the 1981 field season by carefully mapping the site, relocating 
							  the earlier work, and carrying out additional testing to determine where to 
							  locate the main excavations.  Although only six years had elapsed since 
							  the 1975 work, the test pits had been dutifully back-filled, fences had 
							  been moved, and an old dirt road had been abandoned and reclaimed by dense 
							  white brush. We hoped to return to the bone bed area and excavate the 
							  surrounding area, but a massive colony of leaf-cutter ants had taken over 
							  the area, perhaps drawn to the softened deposits created by the 1975 test 
							  pits.</p>
							  <p>So instead the major excavations were carried out some 100’ (30 m) to the 
							  north where promising intact deposits were encountered.  This spot was 
							  centered on an old fence that had long separated the agricultural field 
							  from the brush and tree-choked banks of the creek.  This boundary proved 
							  fortuitous, because the plowing had stopped just short of the fence—within 
							  the field the site deposits had been churned by decades of plowing.  The 
							  abandoned dirt road had run just inside the fence, which led us to give the 
							  major excavation block the somewhat euphemistic name the “Wagon Trail Area.” </p>
							  <p>Our excavations followed and sometimes improved upon standard field 
							  methods.  These are  detailed in Chapter 3 of the site report, 
							    <a href="images/Black-1986-ReMeth.pdf" target="_blank">Research Methods<img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Research Methods pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>. As we encountered intact 
							  features, such as cooking hearths and clusters of discarded animal bones, we 
							  expanded the “Wagon Trail Area” excavations to form an excavation block that 
							  eventually measured 6-x-6 meters with two adjoining smaller blocks. The 
							  combined wagon trail area totaled about 52 square meters.  We were able to 
							  open up a modest-sized excavation area on the edge of the bone bed area 
							  before realizing the full extent of the leaf-cutter ant depredations.  We 
							  documented part of an intact layer of occupation debris we called a “living 
							  surface” and we surmised that this would have been a good area for broad 
							  excavations had it not been for the pesky ants.</p>
							  <p>The stratigraphy in the area of the main excavation block was 
							  uncomplicated.  At the surface was a light-colored plow zone (Zone 1) of 
							  varying thickness below which was a darker-colored sandy clay layer (Zone 2) 
							  with no visible internal layers.  Zone 1 had been churned (disturbed) by 
							  plowing and had no intact features, but some displaced artifacts.   Zone 2 
							  had intact features and numerous artifacts—this was the main occupation zone.
							  The darker color was caused by higher levels of organic material, such as decayed 
							  leaves and, especially, decayed organic materials left behind by the site’s former 
							  inhabitants (food debris, sticks, worn-out sandals, tattered fur, and a hundred 
							  other discarded and abandoned things made of perishable materials).</p>

	<p>Judging from the intact materials, it appears that following the 
	occupation of the Hinojosa site, the cultural remains were covered fairly quickly by the same 
	long-term process that formed the terrace upon which the site occurs.  Namely, sediment from 
	overbank floods.  That said, there was no obvious evidence of distinct flood layers, probably 
	because the floods left behind only thin deposits that were soon  mixed within the soil  by tree roots, 
	worms, and other agents of “bioturbation.”  If the site were excavated today, a geoarcheologist 
	would conduct a special study to explain more precisely how the site deposits formed then we 
	were able to in 1981.  Geoarcheological investigations were relatively uncommon in those days and, 
	as site deposits go, those at the Hinojosa site weren’t very complicated. Still, there may well 
	have been subtle evidence of layering that we did not recognize.</p>
	<p>We did sink deeper test pits in several places in search of deeper occupation layers and found 
	none, although we did encounter deeper soil layers that contained little or no archeological evidence. 
	 We also did something a bit unusual.  We purposefully dug two test pits in the agricultural field, 
	 well outside the limits of the archeological site.  These “noise pits” were excavated to give us a 
	 sample of the “background noise,” meaning a sample of the natural, non-cultural debris which we could 
	 compare to the materials recovered from within the site.   We did this because we wanted to know if
	  all the rocks, bones, and snails found within the site could be attributed to humans.  The noise pit 
	  results gave us confidence and measurable data showing that there was very little background noise 
	  in the area around the Hinojosa site.</p>
