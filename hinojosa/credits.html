                        <p>This exhibit was written by <strong>Steve 
					  Black</strong>, who directed the major investigations at Hinojosa,  took most of the site photographs, and 
					  drafted all of the report graphics that appear in this exhibit. TBH editorial assistant <strong>Heather Smith</strong> designed the exhibit and did the web programming. </p>
                          <p>Work on the Hinojosa  exhibit was supported by grants                 from the <strong>National Endowment for the Humanities </strong> and the <strong>Texas Preservation Trust Fund</strong> (Texas Historical                 Commission). Additional funding was provided by <strong>E. Tom Miller</strong> and the <strong>Southern Texas Archaeological Association</strong>, a TBH partner organization. In 1978, the Hinojosa site was officially listed on the <strong>National Register of Historic Places</strong>, the only locale listed in Jim Wells County. </p>
                          <p>Steve Black is co-editor of <em>Texas Beyond History</em> and 
					  has been a working archeologist since the mid-1970s.  The 1981 excavations at the Hinojosa 
					  site occurred midway through Black’s 8-year career at the University of Texas at San 
					  Antonio (UTSA) where he worked at the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) and earned 
					  a Master’s degree.  At the time, <strong>Dr. Thomas R. Hester</strong> was the CAR Director and 
					  Professor of Anthropology and it was he who served as the Principal Investigator 
					  and oversaw the Hinojosa work.  The 1981 investigations at Hinojosa were done for 
					  $50,000, a sum that wouldn’t begin to cover the cost of carrying out a similar 
					  project today. And, if truth be told, it did not really cover the cost of the 
					  Hinojosa work.</p>
                          <p>As the fieldwork and initial lab work progressed, we realized that the site had 
					  even more research potential than we had anticipated.  We stretched the funds as far 
					  as they would go and then some.  The outside consultants, especially those from 
					  Texas A&M, accomplished far more than covered by the modest fees they were paid.  Black worked on 
					  some aspect of the site as part of many of the graduate courses he took at UTSA, and 
					  the draft site report was accepted as  his Master’s thesis. Hester 
					  managed to cover some additional costs through creative administrative choices.  
					  Hester was also able to persuade the project sponsor (<strong>National Park Service, 
					  Interagency Archeological Services-Denver</strong>) to grant us several extensions of time. 
					  And, beginning in 1984, Black continued to work on the report during “spare time” in 
					  his first few years of further graduate work at Harvard.  When the report was 
					  finally finished, Hester was so relieved that, against his better judgment, he 
					  allowed Black to choose the bright red report cover stock.</p>
					      <p>TBH partner, the <strong>Center for Archaeological Research</strong> at <strong>UTSA</strong>, provided access to 
					  the Hinjosa records, photographs, and artifacts, all of which are permanently curated there.  
					  The CAR-UTSA also approved of the presentation of a substantial portion of the 
					  Hinojosa report as linked PDF documents.</p>
					      <p>The 1981 fieldwork was done mostly by a core crew including assistant field 
					  director Al McGraw, Tom Miller, Courtenay Jones, Cecil Peel, and Mike Woerner.  
					  All were experienced field archeologists who worked hard and did careful and thoughtful work over 
					  and beyond the call of duty.  Over the fall of 1981 and early winter in 1982 we made 
					  Alice, Texas our weekday home and were consistently treated well by its citizens, 
					  despite our scruffy appearance and eyebrow-raising  business  in Jim Wells County.</p>
