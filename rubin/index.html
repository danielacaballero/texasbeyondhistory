                  <p class="text"><a name="family"></a>In an area now overrun 
                    by the busy interchange of Loop 1 and Parmer Lane in north 
                    Austin lie the remnants of what was once a thriving community 
                    of freed African-American slaves. Prominent in that community 
                    were Rubin and Elizabeth Hancock who, after emancipation, 
                    bought land, established a farm, and raised a family. Their 
                    story&#151;and that of their descendents and neighbors&#151;has 
                    been brought to life through archeological and historical 
                    investigations. </p>
					
                  <p class="text"> Rubin Hancock, his wife, Elizabeth, and many 
                    of their family members, were slaves of the prominent Austin 
                    judge, John Hancock. Little is known for certain about their 
                    early life, other than that they were all born into slavery&#151;Rubin 
                    in Alabama and Elizabeth in Tennessee&#151;during the 1840s. 
                    Although Texas did not recognize slave marriages (which otherwise 
                    would have resulted in written records), it is known that 
                    the two were married, or committed as life partners, before 
                    they gained their freedom. More is known about the life and 
                    philosophies of the judge. Despite his reliance on slavery, 
                    Judge Hancock was adamantly opposed to Texas' secession from 
                    the Union. After being elected to the state legislature in 
                    1860 as a Unionist, he was removed from office when he refused 
                    to swear allegiance to the Confederacy.</p>
                   
                  <p class="text"> The1860 Census entry for Judge Hancock notes 
                    his ownership of 15 slaves. Although none were individually 
                    listed, it is likely that Rubin Hancock and his brothers Orange, 
                    Salem, and Peyton were among them at that time. It is also 
                    likely, according to family histories, that the four men were 
                    half-brothers of the judge. Their considerable duties would 
                    have included clearing land, planting, and working a 300-acre 
                    dairy farm; maintaining cattle and other livestock on the 
                    judge's extensive ranch lands; and building a variety of structures.</p>
                  <p class="text">The end of the Civil War in 1865 brought emancipation 
                    for slaves, announced in Texas on June 19, 1865. Sometime 
                    after that, Rubin and his three brothers bought land in the 
                    area north of Austin, making them landowners at a time when 
                    many others&#151;Whites and African-Americans alike&#151;were 
                    sharecroppers and tenants. With few resources available beyond 
                    their own strength and determination&#151; and the possible 
                    assistance of Rubin's former master, the judge&#151;Rubin 
                    and Elizabeth Hancock established a productive farm, raised 
                    a family of five children, and helped establish a small but 
                    stable community of African-American farmers. </p>
                  <p class="text">Known as Duval, the community was bound by family 
                    ties and a strong church, St. Stephen's Missionary Baptist, 
                    in which social gatherings, school classes for African-American 
                    children, and worship services were held. The coming of the 
                    A&amp;NW railroad through the Hancock farm in 1881 meant an 
                    influx of families into the area and the new recreational 
                    resort of Summers Grove (later Waters Park). It also provided 
                    a means of transport for farm products, such as cotton from 
                    Rubin Hancock's fields, to nearby markets. </p>
                  <h3><a name="life"></a>Life on the Farm</h3>
                  <p class="text">Rubin Hancock's granddaughter, Mable Walker 
                    Newton, remembered visiting the farm as a child when Rubin 
                    was in his later years. She described his home as a comfortable 
                    house of logs and lumber siding with two rooms under the main 
                    roof. The kitchen was a shed-type addition under a separate 
                    roof. One room was the living room, where the fireplace was 
                    located. Newton remembered that both rooms had big windows 
                    with glass and wooden shutters that could be closed over them. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">As was the case for many farm families of the 
                    time, life was difficult, with seemingly unending chores for 
                    adults and children alike. There was no running water or electricity; 
                    water was hauled from a well, and all cooking was done on 
                    a cast iron wood stove, for which wood had to be chopped each 
                    day. Kerosene lanterns provided lighting for the small house. 
                    The family raised cows and pigs, grew cotton and corn, and 
                    maintained a large vegetable garden and fruit trees. Surplus 
                    was sold to local store owners or sold in Austin. </p>
                  <p class="text">According to family stories, the children found 
                    entertainment by playing baseball, marbles, and dominoes using 
                    handmade pieces made of cardboard. On Sundays, they attended 
                    Sunday school and church picnics at St. Paul's Baptist Church. 
                    Evenings often were filled with singing and socials with neighboring 
                    friends and relatives.</p>
                  <p class="text">Elizabeth Hancock died in 1899. Rubin Hancock 
                    lived and continued to work the farm until well into his sixties, 
                    leaving finally to live with his daughter, Susie, until his 
                    death in 1916. The three surviving children, all daughters, 
                    kept the farm until 1942, when the house was moved off the 
                    site.</p>
                  <h3><a name="story"></a>Weaving the Story</h3>
                  <p class="text">Little remains today of the small communities that once dotted 
                    the landscape in north Austin, save for a few street signs 
                    bearing some of their names. Over the past 100 years, northwest 
                    Travis county has changed from a rural area to one of the 
                    fastest-growing urban areas in the United States. When a highway 
                    extension was planned in the area of Duval Road and Loop 1 
                    (Mo Pac), archeologists from the Texas Department of Transportation 
                    (TxDOT) surveyed the area for evidence of significant cultural 
                    remains. They also examined old maps and records, and it was 
                    through these means that they learned of the Hancock farmstead. 
                    Using an aerial photo from 1937, TxDOT archeologist John Clark 
                    was able to pinpoint the location of the farm and begin investigations. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">On the surface, there was little evidence of 
                    its existence, save for a well, chimney hearth, sections of 
                    fences, and low stone walls. Excavations helped locate possible 
                    stone piers of the house, trash areas, animal pens, and scatters 
                    of artifacts, giving archeologists a better idea of the original 
                    farmstead layout and patterns of day-to-day life. One of the 
                    more poignant finds was the skeleton of a dog&#151;likely 
                    a family pet&#151;carefully placed in a shallow grave.</p>
                    
                  <p class="text"> Although more than 9000 artifacts were uncovered, 
                    most were fragmentary. Nonetheless, careful analysis of the 
                    many shards of glass, pottery fragments, and metal objects 
                    revealed much about the family, their day-to-day life, and 
                    their purchasing habits and tastes. </p>
                  <p class="text">As Prewitt and Associates historical archeologist 
                    Marie E. Blake analyzed artifacts and other archeological 
                    data, historian Terri Myers set about to research family history. 
                    Family members shared recollections and faded photographs. 
                    Former neighbors were interviewed, and church records and 
                    other documents were tracked down.</p>
                  <p class="text">In a final analysis in which all archival, oral, 
                    and archeological evidence was weighed together, several defining 
                    characteristics of the Hancock family and farm become clear. 
                    The family members put forth a great deal of effort to achieve 
                    a level of equality and success, acquiring for themselves 
                    through their own hard work a comfortable life complete with 
                    both the necessities and some of the trappings of genteel 
                    respectability. All of the Hancock brothers were able to own 
                    and work their own farms. Each registered to vote and each 
                    married and raised a family&#151;members of which still prosper 
                    in the Austin area. All was created by the will and effort 
                    of a group of people who had just come out of the bonds of 
                    slavery. Freedom was sweet and they made the most of it.</p>
                  <h3 class="text style1"><strong>Afterward</strong></h3>
                  <p class="text">Since the time of excavations at the Rubin Hancock site, a comprehensive suite of investigations has been conducted at the Moore-Hancock farmstead in Austin, where Rubin Hancock and his brothers lived and were enslaved to Judge John Hancock. Current landowners Michael and Karen Collins were uniquely suited to overseeing the investigation process: Mike is an archeologist with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, and Karen is an historian. Through their efforts, the story of Judge Hancock's farmstead and the families who lived in what is now the Rosedale area of Austin have been brought to life. During the process, numerous descendants of the Hancock family, including former slaves, were contacted, and they attended the dedication ceremony for an historical marker at the site.</p>

                    of the Rubin Hancock farmstead was developed in 1999 by Dr. 
                    <strong>Mary S. Black</strong> of the Department of Curriculum and Instruction 
                    at UT-Austin. Lessons focus on tracing family history, utilizing 
                    archival resources, map-making and map analysis, analyzing 
                  artifacts, and doing archeology. <a href="http://www.dot.state.tx.us/env/education/rhfarm.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">http://www.dot.state.tx.us/env/education/rhfarm.pdf/</A>                  </p>
