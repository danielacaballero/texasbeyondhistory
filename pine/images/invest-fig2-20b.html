      <p>This photograph, a little farther from the  center of the mound, shows many of the same things as the photograph to the  left. Zone 16 is the natural ground below the mound. Zone 9 is a burned surface  in the middle of the mound, and Zones 48, 49, 58, and 51 (also called F-192,  F-193, F-201, and F-195) probably held posts for one or more buildings put on  top of the Zone 9 surface. The remains of the earlier burned and collapsed  building (Zone 12) are thicker here and partly rest on the two burned floors  (Zones 13 and 14). On the right side, though, the building fell onto a low  ridge of yellow and white earth that probably encircled the whole building.  Zone 50 (F-194) below Zone 12 may be a posthole that went with the Zone 12  building, or maybe with another building on top of the layer of reddish dirt  called Zone 27. It is hard tell which, though, because the Caddo removed most  of Zone 27 when they excavated a shallow depression to hold the building that  Zones 12, 13, and 14 represent.</p>
      <p>This photograph does not show any burned  surfaces in the upper part of the mound. This is partly because the top of the  mound is sloping down and getting thinner, so it has been more affected by  erosion. Disturbance from animal burrowing may be another factor. The  archeologists decided that, because of its irregular shape, Zone 47 (F-191)  might be where an animal dug into the mound and churned up the dirt after the  Caddo left the site.&nbsp; </p>
