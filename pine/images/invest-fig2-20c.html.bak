      <p>In this photograph, we&rsquo;re moving out to  where the mound is not very tall. We can still see the natural ground (Zone 16)  at the bottom on the left side, but it is not visible on the right side because  the trench was shallower there. Zones 15, 27, and 31 are the first layers of dirt the Caddo  put down to make the mound. They may have put a special building, either a  temple or a house for a religious or political leader, on what was then a very  low mound and then dismantled it, but it is hard to know for sure because they  removed most of these layers when they erected the building to the west (Zones  12, 13, and 14). Zone 13/14 is a burned surface outside this building and its  adjacent low ridge. We surmise that the Caddo used this low outdoor platform  for activities connected with what went on inside the nearby building. Zones 52  and 53 (F-198 and F-197) are a posthole and perhaps a pit that were dug from  higher, later surfaces as the mound grew.</p>
