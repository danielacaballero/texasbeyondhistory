  <tr>
    <td width="480" valign="top"><p>At its zenith some 500 to 600 years ago, Pine Tree Mound was an important, thriving community within the Nadaco Caddo world.  
      The nucleus of this  community apparently consisted of about 15 household compounds  situated around the ceremonial precinct, which had its complement of  ceremonial buildings and houses for the group&rsquo;s leaders and priests.</p>
      <p> If  archeologists are correct in this estimation, then it appears likely that up to  about 125 people lived here at any one time. In general, this village looks  much like what is shown on a map of a Nasoni Caddo village on the Red River  that was made when Domingo Ter&aacute;n de los R&iacute;os, the first governor of the Spanish  province of Texas,  visited there in 1691. </p>
      <p> Some of these residential areas were close to the ceremonial  precinct, while others were much farther away. This variability in distance  appears to be a functional rather than formal distinction. In other words,  places on the landscape best suited for  building houses were chosen, as opposed to a planned layout  of villages arrayed around the ceremonial area. Other considerations may have come into play, however. For example, it is possible that higher-status  members of the community were allowed to live closer to the ceremonial area  than commoners.</p>
      <p>So, what did these household  compounds look like? Based on the excavations in three of them, it seems that,  more often than not, each consisted of a single circular pole-and-thatch house  averaging about 20 feet (6&nbsp;m) in diameter. Two houses may have stood simultaneously in  some areas at certain times, but this appears to have been the exception rather  than the rule. Auxiliary structures such as ramadas covering outdoor work areas  and granaries for storing corn probably were present as well, along with  less-substantial structures such as drying racks and wind screens. </p>
      <p>The evidence  from the excavations suggests that the Caddo did not occupy most of these  residential areas continuously. They built a house and then rebuilt it once,  twice, or three times as deterioration occurred and  support posts needed to be replaced. Each use  spanned   perhaps no more than 40 years; then they abandoned that area for a time  before reoccupying it again later and building a new house. Thus, these can be seen  as multigenerational house compounds. What spurred the ebb and flow of  occupation is unknown, although it could relate to events such as the death of  a lineage head, for example.</p>
      <p>This community  extended beyond the Pine Tree Mound site, however, and archeologists have been able to approximate the extent of the greater Nadaco &quot;neighborhood.&quot; Because of extensive lignite  mining in this part of Harrison   County, archeologists have walked  over many thousands of acres and found about 400 archeological sites with  Native American artifacts. Forty of these sites distributed along four northern  tributaries of the Sabine River and the margin  of the river valley itself appear to be the same age as Pine Tree Mound, and  thus the people who lived and camped at these places probably were connected to  the people who lived at Pine Tree. Three of the tributary valleys&mdash;those of  Spring, Hatley, and Clarks Creeks&mdash;each have just a handful of sites. The  fourth&mdash;Potters Creek&mdash;has the most sites, including Pine Tree Mound, and this  cluster of sites appears to represent the main Nadaco Caddo village, with Pine  Tree Mound as its political, social, and religious anchor. This main village  stretched for a distance of about 3 miles up and down the creek. </p>
	  <h3>How Big Was the Territory of the Nadaco Caddo?</h3>
      <p>Clearly, the powerful leaders who  lived at the Pine Tree Mound site ruled an area larger than just the Potters  Creek valley and those of nearby tributaries. Because of uneven archeological  coverage, it is hard to judge just how large their territory was, but there is  enough evidence for archeologists to hypothesize that the greater Nadaco Caddo  territory extended across an area roughly 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) north-south by about 40 miles (60&nbsp;km)  east-west, with the Sabine River and its broad floodplain running through the  middle. People were not distributed evenly throughout this area, though. As  noted, the main village was north of the river, stretching for 3 miles along  Potters Creek and anchored by the Pine Tree Mound site at its north end. The  rest of the community appears to have been more rural, with widely scattered  household compounds in other north-side tributary valleys and the entire  territory south of the river, accounting for well over half of it, having been  sparsely settled. The Nadaco Caddo undoubtedly hunted and fished on the Sabine  River floodplain, but this area floods too often for it to have been a good  place to build houses.</p>
      <h3> The Nadaco Caddo and the Southern Caddo World </h3>
      <p>The Nadaco Caddo did not live in  isolation from the wider Caddo world. The deepest connections were with Caddo  groups living in the Cypress Creek drainage just to the north and northwest.  These groups belonged to what archeologists have labeled the Titus phase. (A phase refers to a pattern of archeological remains&#8212;a cultural expression&#8212;relating to a particular time period and area.) There  also was interaction with Belcher phase groups who lived along the Red River to  the east and northeast, Frankston phase peoples in the upper Neches/Angelina  basin to the southwest, perhaps the Texarkana and McCurtain phase Caddo who  lived on the Red River at and above the Great Bend to the north, and likely  even Mid-Ouachita phase groups in south-central Arkansas.</p>
      <p>Clues about these connections come  from the kinds of stones that some of the tools and ornaments from the Pine  Tree Mound site are made of. The vast majority are of materials that could have  been obtained locally, but small numbers came from the Ouachita Mountains of  Oklahoma and Arkansas or gravels redeposited in the Red River from the  Ouachitas. Given the source areas, these nonlocal rocks may indicate  interaction with McCurtain, Texarkana, and even Mid-Ouachita phase peoples. </p>
      <p>Particularly notable are three sets  of stone ear spools recovered from three graves. These are similar in form and  size to two sets of ear spools from the Belcher phase Foster site in  southwestern Arkansas, and the craftsmen who made these items may have been  residents of that region and obtained the argillite they are made of there.  Least prominent in the collection are artifacts of materials that appear to be  from central Texas and the southern part of east Texas; these probably were  introduced through contact with Frankston phase peoples. The overall  infrequency of these tools and ornaments, and the fact that many were included  as grave offerings, indicate they were not mundane items. Instead, most were  prized symbols of power, authority, status, or role, as well as symbols of the  connections that tied elite members of the Pine Tree Mound community to their  peers in neighboring and more far-flung Caddo communities, cementing  relationships between them.</p>
      <p>The pottery found  in the graves provides other important clues about connections. A few of the  pots from Pine Tree Mound clearly are imports from Belcher, Texarkana, and  Frankston phase peoples, but the vast majority were made locally or by potters  living in Titus phase sites to the north or northwest. In fact, the strong  connection through a shared ceramic tradition between the Pine Tree Mound site  and Titus phase communities indicates these groups were closely related. </p>
      <p>We do not know  what the people who created the Titus sites called themselves, since the  accounts by the early explorers and traders who visited that area did not  record that information. There is one important piece of evidence indicating  that the Nadaco Caddo at Pine Tree Mound considered themselves separate from  their neighbors in the Titus phase heartland, though. That evidence comes from  how they buried their dead. At Pine Tree, the Nadaco Caddo buried people with  their heads to the south or southeast, while the Titus phase Caddo oriented  graves to the east and northeast. </p>
      <p>These different  burial practices may be one way that groups within associated communities  differentiated themselves while still participating within the wider Caddo  society. In this case, it appears that the path of souls mythology may have had  a role in the practices for both. The Titus phase Caddo generally buried their  dead with their feet on the path of souls and their heads to the rising sun.  Those buried at Pine Tree Mound also had their feet on the path of souls, but  their heads would have been aligned with the Great Serpent as represented by  Antares, with the rising sun on their right hand.</p>
        <h3>What Happened to the Nadaco Caddo People?</h3>
        <p>People continued living at the Pine  Tree Mound site into the 1600s and 1700s, but the heyday of that place as both  a population center and the focus of ceremonial activities for the community  was in the 1400s and 1500s. Why did this change, and what happened to the  people who made up this community? Population loss from diseases introduced by  the 1542 visit by the De Soto expedition could be part of the answer, but  events that unfolded over the succeeding two-and-a-half centuries also must  have played a role. Sitting so close to the Hasinai Trace, the Caddo of the  Potters Creek valley were in a prime location to meet and be affected by the  European and American explorers, traders, and later settlers who frequented the  area starting in the 1680s, as well as immigrant Native Americans from the  southeastern U.S. Their interactions with many different groups brought about a  slow decline, dispersal, and reconfiguration of the population. A map made in  1717 indicates that one branch of the Nadaco Caddo had moved south into the  Angelina River basin to be near the Hasinai Caddo by that time, but Pedro  Vial&rsquo;s account is clear that a northern branch was still living in the Sabine  basin in 1788.</p>
      <p>There are a number of sites in and  around Harrison County where graves containing Caddo pottery and historic trade  materials have been found, and two of these, Susie Slade and Henry Brown No. 1,  are in the Potters Creek valley just south of Pine Tree Mound. The kinds of  trade goods&mdash;including glass beads, gun parts, hawk bells, and iron arrow points  or knife blades&mdash;indicate that at least parts of these cemeteries were created  in the 1700s and probably early 1800s. Whether these sites represent parts of  the reconfigured Nadaco Caddo community formerly centered at Pine Tree Mound or  settlements by new intrusive groups remains an open question. The fact that  some of them are close to Pine Tree argues for the first interpretation, as  does the fact that some burials are oriented the same way as the burials at  Pine Tree.</p>
      <p>But most of the pottery from these later  sites looks more like pottery made by Caddo groups who lived on the Red River  to the east and north. For instance, these graves contained pots in styles that  archeologists call Natchitoches or Hodges Engraved, Simms or Darco Engraved,  and Emory Punctated, unlike the graves at Pine Tree Mound where Ripley Engraved  bowls and bottles and Pease Brushed-Incised jars were common. This suggests  that the later pottery did not develop out of the ceramics made in the Potters  Creek valley; instead, its antecedents appear to lie elsewhere. These styles of  pots do occur over a wide area, however, and they may have been acquired  through trade rather than the movement of people.</p>
      <p>One way of interpreting the evidence  from the Potters Creek valley is that it does contain the remnant resident  population of the Pine Tree Mound community, but one that had been affected in  profound ways by interactions they and other Caddo groups had with Europeans  and Americans between the late 1600s and early 1800s. With so many changes afoot,  and so much movement of people and interaction between groups, both Native and  not, it is little wonder we see differences from what was common just a short  time before. What remained of the Pine Tree Mound community probably had been  severely altered by population loss through disease and rapid shifts of the  centers of political power as Europeans and Americans entered the region. Other  Caddo groups likely consolidated with or subsumed what was left of this  community in the face of these changes, creating an archeological signature  different than the one that preceded it.</p></td>

	    <p>Of the forty known sites near Pine Tree Mound that appear to be the same age, all but one likely represent small household compounds where one or two families lived, or maybe places where people camped while on hunting trips or tending agricultural fields. The one site that is different, called the Lane Mitchell site, is southwest of Pine Tree Mound. It is marked by four or five small mounds lined up along the bluff overlooking the creek valley. Limited excavations suggest that most or all of the mounds contain burned structures probably used in religious ceremonies and possibly similar to one or both of the two smaller mounds at Pine Tree Mound. Unlike at Pine Tree, though, there is neither an obvious plaza nor surrounding village compounds. <br>
	      </p>
	    <p>Just how Pine Tree Mound and Lane Mitchell are related is unknown, but the latter is probably a secondary ceremonial space. The fact that Lane Mitchell sits astride a straight northeast-southwest line between Pine Tree and an earlier Caddo mound center known as the Hudnall-Pirtle site has led archeologists to speculate that it may have served as a geographic marker connecting the old center of power and authority (Hudnall-Pirtle) with the new (Pine Tree Mound).<br>
