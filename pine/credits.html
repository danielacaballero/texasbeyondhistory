  <tr>
    <td width="480" height="2773" valign="top"><p>The Pine Tree Mound exhibit was written by <strong>Ross Fields</strong> and <strong>Eloise  Gadus</strong> of Prewitt and Associates, Inc., of Austin. <strong>Susan Dial</strong> and <strong>Heather Smith</strong> developed the exhibit for the web. Graphics were drawn by <strong>Sandy Hannum</strong> and <strong>Brian Wootan</strong> of Prewitt. The colorful reconstructed scenes of Caddo  life that enrich this exhibit are  from paintings by <strong>Nola Davis</strong>, courtesy of Texas Parks and Wildlife, <strong>Reeda Peel</strong>, and <strong>George Nelson</strong>. </p>
      <p>The  archeological project was unusual in many regards. In the view of the Prewitt staff, few archeologists  have the opportunity to excavate a site that is as important to a particular  culture or group as Pine Tree Mound is to the Caddo. The individuals and  groups who contributed are recognized below.</p>
      <h3>Prewitt and Associates, Inc. </h3>
      <p>  Ross C. Fields was the  principal investigator from the inception of the project to its completion. His  understanding of and great curiosity about the archeology of northeast Texas  shaped the scope and direction of the research and was key to linking the Pine  Tree Mound site to its rightful place in Caddo history and prehistory. He is the president of Prewitt and Associates, Inc., an  Austin-based firm that provides archeological and historical consulting  services to federal and state agencies, local governments, private  industry, and individuals. He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in  anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin. Before joining  Prewitt and Associates as a Staff Archeologist in 1981, he honed his  archeological skills on a variety of projects in places such as east  Texas, northeastern Oklahoma, southeastern Alaska, and the Four Corners  region of the Southwest. Although he has worked on a variety of  projects throughout Texas, his strongest research interests lie in east  Texas, having been fostered by a 1975 field school with Dee Ann Story  at Deshazo, a protohistoric Caddo hamlet west of Nacogdoches, and work  in 1977 and 1980 at the George C. Davis site.</p>
      <p>Eloise  Frances Gadus was the project archeologist for the 2006&ndash;2007 excavations. She  collaborated with Fields in analyzing the data recovered and writing the  exhibit. Her interest in symbols as a means of understanding how people view  their world brought a fresh perspective to study of the pottery and analysis of  the mortuary remains for this project. A research archeologist who has worked for Prewitt  for over 20 years, she is an expert in the  prehistoric Native American societies of east Texas and the Gulf Coast.  This interest grew out of her undergraduate research assistantship at  the Cleveland Museum of Natural History of Ohio where she was  introduced to the prehistory of the Southeastern United States. She  also gained experience in the field of Cultural Resource Management by  working for the University of West Florida at Pensacola in both Florida  and Mississippi and from her graduate studies at the University of  Florida, Gainesville</p>
      <h3>The Caddo Nation of  Oklahoma      </h3>
      <p> The Pine Tree Mound  site has been a place of great significance to the Caddo people for hundreds of  years. The Caddo Nation  of Oklahoma has been instrumental in helping exploration of their past go forward. This exhibit is  but one version of the story of the Nadaco Caddo in northeast Texas, and it is  offered in a spirit of respect for the rich traditions of the Caddo people. In  that spirit, North American Coal Corporation&ndash;Sabine Mine coordinated this  project with the Caddo Nation through Tribal Historic Preservation Officer Robert  Cast and NAGPRA Coordinator Bobby Gonzalez. Caddo elder Lyman Kionute visited  the site with Cast and  Gonzalez in 2006 to lend his understanding of  the importance of the site. After the fieldwork was finished, representatives  from the North American Coal Corporation&ndash;Sabine Mine, American Electric Power,  and Prewitt and Associates, Inc., traveled to the Caddo Nation headquarters in  Binger, Oklahoma, and presented the initial project findings to the Tribal  Council then chaired by LaRue Parker. Coordination for repatriating the  people disinterred from the site during the excavations was done by the Sabine  Mine through  Gonzalez and  Cast.</p>
      <h3>North American Coal  Corporation&ndash;Sabine Mine </h3>
      <p>  The North American Coal Corporation&rsquo;s  Sabine Mine produces lignite to operate the H.&nbsp;W. Pirkey Power Plant  nearby. The plant is operated by American Electric Power (AEP), which was the  ultimate funding source for the project. AEP&rsquo;s commitment to the project  extended well beyond funding the archeological work, however; they also  volunteered to purchase part of the site and donate it to the Archaeological  Conservancy for preservation. The project would not have had the positive  outcomes it did without the determination of Sabine Mine and AEP to meet and  exceed their regulatory requirements. For Sabine Mine, Marty Walker, Roger  Fish, Randy Harris, and Phil Berry successively served as Environmental Manager  and oversaw the work. For AEP, Ken Howsen and Greg Shurbet played key roles in  pushing the project forward and ultimately getting part of the site preserved.</p>
      <h3>The Archaeological  Conservancy      </h3>
      <p> The Archaeological  Conservancy is a national nonprofit organization that acquires and preserves  some of the nation&rsquo;s most important archeological sites. Dr. Dee Ann Story, a  pioneering Texas archeologist, was on the Conservancy&rsquo;s board of directors when  work started at Pine Tree Mound. She was instrumental in alerting the  Conservancy to the value of the site, and the Conservancy&rsquo;s Jim Walker and Amy  Espinoza understood the need to move quickly to protect the remainder of the  site once mining operations were complete. Their acceptance of the task of  managing the property in trust means that the Pine Tree Mound site will always  remain a special place. To honor her part in preserving the site, the  Conservancy named their preserve there for Dr.  Story.</p>
