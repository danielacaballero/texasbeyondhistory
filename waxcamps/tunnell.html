              life&#151;richly varied, meaningful, accomplished, and blessed with 
              love. He pursued his work and boundless interests with vigor and 
              passion, as is reflected in this photographic study of traditional 
              wax making. His unexpected death at the age of 67 prompted an enormous 
              outpouring of tributes and nostalgic reflections from the many friends 
              and colleagues who knew him and shared in his life's journey. A 
              common thread that runs throughout the tributes is Tunnell's integrity, 
              his passion for life, and his loving concern for others, whether 
              family member, co-worker, friend, or stranger. </p>

                  <p class="text">Texas lost a living legend on April 13, 2001. 
                    Longtime archeologist, preservationist, oral historian, and 
                    folklorist Curtis Tunnell passed away in Austin at the age 
                    of 67. A native of Turkey, in Hall County, Tunnell recalled 
                    his homeland of the Texas rolling plains as &quot;a beautiful 
                    place for a boy to grow up in the years before World War II. 
                    My earliest memories,&quot; he recalled, &quot;were of looking 
                    toward the west and seeing the sculptured purple silhouette 
                    of the Caprock. This rugged escarpment of the plains beckoned 
                    steadily, from the Quitaque Peaks on the south to Eagle's 
                    Point on the north. This vista always made my mind take flight.&quot; 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The land had a tremendous impact on Tunnell, 
                    as did his encounters with various cultures, both ancient 
                    and modern. By the time he left home for West Texas State 
                    College in Canyon, his interests in geology, paleontology, 
                    and anthropology were already developing.</p>
                  <p class="text">At West Texas, Tunnell worked in the Panhandle-Plains 
                    Historical Museum, one of the leading archeological research 
                    centers in the state. There, he met his lifelong mentor, Jack 
                    Hughes. Together, they covered vast areas of the Texas Panhandle, 
                    conducting archeological investigations on rock shelters, 
                    pit burials, bison kill sites, and countless other projects.</p>
                  <p class="text">While in college, Tunnell participated in military 
                    training through Officers Candidate School. Upon graduation 
                    he joined the U.S. Navy and saw service in the Pacific, ferrying 
                    supplies to such outposts as Johnston Island, the Midway Islands, 
                    and the Marshalls. His ship, the USS Kishwaukee, was also 
                    involved in early atomic bomb testing at the Bikini and Enewetak 
                    atolls. </p>
                  <p class="text">Following military service, Tunnell returned 
                    to Texas and began working with archeologist Ed Jelks on the 
                    Texas River Basins Survey project funded by the Smithsonian 
                    Institution. Their first investigations took place along the 
                    McGee Bend of the Angelina River in East Texas, later impounded 
                    as part of Sam Rayburn Reservoir. He also worked in the Lake 
                    Amistad area along the Rio Grande. Tunnell followed his fieldwork 
                    with graduate studies at The University of Texas at Austin, 
                    receiving a master's degree in anthropology.</p>
                  <p class="text">From there, he became a field researcher for 
                    the University of Illinois and worked on such sites as the 
                    famed Cahokia Mounds, as well as projects in Kansas and Arizona. 
                    He then returned to Austin as Curator of Anthropology for 
                    the Texas Memorial Museum. There, he and W. W. Newcomb undertook 
                    pioneering work at a site that proved to be the location of 
                    Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz, established by the Spanish 
                    in 1762 to minister to the Lipan Apache.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1965, public demand for historic and archeological 
                    preservation led the Texas Legislature to create the position 
                    of State Archeologist. For the first time, Texas had a formal 
                    public archeology program, and the person selected to fill 
                    the new position was Curtis Tunnell. First assigned to the 
                    Texas State Building Commission, the State Archeologist was 
                    transferred to the Texas State Historical Survey Committee 
                    (later the Texas Historical Commission) in 1969. </p>
                  <p class="text">As State Archeologist, Tunnell participated 
                    in scientific investigations at the Alamo and other important 
                    Spanish Colonial mission and presidio sites in Texas, directed 
                    archeological excavations at the ancient Folsom-age Adair-Steadman 
                    site, and braved the waters of the Rio Grande in order to 
                    record the archeological resources present in the canyons 
                    of the Big Bend region. </p>
                  <p class="text">He battled commercial salvagers to retain the 
                    1554 Spanish shipwreck artifacts for the State of Texas and 
                    was instrumental in the development of the Antiquities Code 
                    of Texas, the legal tool to protect historic resources on 
                    public (state) land, including submerged shipwrecks. His films 
                    and audiotapes documenting the work of numerous folk artisans 
                    and craftsmen in the Texas-Mexico border region may well represent 
                    the only records of the practitioners of many vanishing crafts 
                    and arts.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1981, Tunnell became THC executive director, 
                    a position he held until his retirement in January 1999. Under 
                    his direction, the agency's traditional areas of concentration, 
                    including the Official Texas Historical Markers, National 
                    Register of Historic Places, Texas courthouse law, and other 
                    preservation programs, continued to grow and expand, and new 
                    initiatives were developed. Of special note was the initiation 
                    of the THC's heritage tourism efforts, which were first widely 
                    recognized through the Los Caminos del Rio Heritage Project. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Also during his tenure, the THC's Main Street 
                    program, guided by Anice Read, gained national recognition, 
                    and, with the support of the Texas Legislature, the Texas 
                    Preservation Trust Fund was developed, allowing the THC to 
                    provide matching-grant funding for significant preservation 
                    efforts. Through his decades of state service, Tunnell traveled 
                    to all 254 Texas counties and developed lasting friendships 
                    in all regions of the state. </p>
                  <p class="text">He is remembered particularly as a respected 
                    scientist, a friend to local preservationists, a tireless 
                    worker for &quot;the people's history,&quot; an avid fan of 
                    Texas music, a promoter of Texas cultural crafts, an oral 
                    historian of Texas archeology, and a man who genuinely loved 
                    the myriad people from all walks of life with whom he came 
                    in contact. And that love was returned many times over. People 
                    in each Texas county, in other states, and in remote areas 
                    of Northern Mexico mourn his passing.</p>

                          of my career looking for this shipwreck. I was starting 
                          to wonder if I was ever going to find this old La Salle

              I think there is no chance that Curtis and Jack (Hughes) will sit

              something to investigate, may in fact already be laying out a grid 
              somewhere. If there are streets of gold, they will want to know 
              how thick the gold is, how it was put down, and what lies underneath. 
              And soon, in some otherworldly journal, we may see a report under 
              their names, elegantly written and brilliantly argued, presenting 
              knowledge and insight that even God has forgotten. </em>&#151;Mark
