                  <h3><a name="1"></a>The Candelilla Plant </h3>
                  <p class="text">Candelilla is known as the &quot;weed&quot; 
                    to those who work with wax in west Texas, while the Mexican 
                    laborers simply call it &quot;yerba.&quot; The botanist J.G. 
                    Zuccarini first described the plant for the scientific world 
                    in 1829 and assigned it the name <em>Euphorbia antisyphilitica</em>. 
                    It is curious that he did not discuss the plant's wax but 
                    did mention juice from the plant being used by the indigenous 
                    peoples as a remedy against venereal disease. Some Mexican 
                    herb shops still carry candelilla as a medicinal tea. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1909, G. Alcocer presented a new description 
                    of candelilla, named it <em>Euphorbia cerifera</em>, and discussed 
                    the fine wax produced by the plant. Alcocer's species is considered 
                    synonymous with <em>Euphorbia antisyphilitica Zucc</em>. and 
                    is the primary species of the plant utilized in wax production. 
                    Other minor species also occur in the Chihuahuan Desert. The 
                    common name candelilla probably was applied to the plant because 
                    of its small, erect, wax-coated stems, which resemble little 
                    candles.</p>
                  <p class="text">Candelilla is a perennial and is found in locally 
                    abundant stands in Mexico in northern Zacatecas, western Nuevo 
                    Leon, eastern Durango, and scattered throughout Coahuila and 
                    Chihuahua, and in Texas in El Paso, Hudspeth, Presidio, Jeff 
                    Davis, Brewster, Terrell, and western Val Verde counties. 
                    Small, isolated populations have been reported in southern 
                    Texas and the Mexican states of Guanajuato and Hidalgo. </p>
                  <p class="text">The plant commonly grows on well-drained limestone 
                    slopes but is occasionally found associated with igneous rocks, 
                    and it does not seem to grow well in bottomlands and clayey 
                    soils. The root system is small but each plant supports numerous 
                    erect stems, which are mostly simple but occasionally are 
                    branched. A plant of moderate size may produce as many as 
                    100 stems and be, in aggregate, from 1 to 2.5 feet in diameter. 
                    The stems range from about 1 to 2 feet in length and 1/16 
                    to 1/3 of an inch in diameter and are grayish green in color. 
                    In the wax camps we have occasionally observed an unusually 
                    large plant with stems at least 3 feet in length.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Where candelilla has a chance to grow normally, 
                    the plant clusters get larger and larger until they may be 
                    as much as 61/2 feet in diameter. When they get that large 
                    they begin to die down in the center and leave a doughnut-shaped 
                    ring of candelilla. Near McKinney Springs in 1980 we found 
                    plant clusters of this shape that had rabbit nests in the 
                    center of the ring. Detailed botanical descriptions of the 
                    plant can be found in <em>Trees, Shrubs, and Woody Vines of 
                    the Southwest</em> by Robert Vines and in <em>Manual of the 
                    Vascular Plants of Texas</em> by D.S. Correll and M.C. Johnston. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The candelilla plant has been observed flowering 
                    from April through August, apparently coinciding with spring 
                    and summer rains. Stands of the plant seem to be most abundant 
                    at elevations around 2,500 feet and are commonly associated 
                    with lechuguilla, sotol, chinograss, ocotillo, and various 
                    cacti. Severe freezes at higher elevations are said to kill 
                    the plants back to their roots. Candelilla is generally a 
                    very hardy species and not particularly susceptible to diseases 
                    or pests. It does serve as occasional forage for goats and 
                    rabbits. Texas A&amp;M palynologist Vaughn Bryant says candelilla 
                    produces small amounts of pollen, which is sticky and tends 
                    to fall directly to the ground. Candelilla pollen is unlikely 
                    to be widespread or abundant and probably is rare in the archeological 
                    record. </p>
                  <p class="text">The wax of the candelilla is an epidermal secretion 
                    on the stems that helps conserve internal moisture of the 
                    plants during severe hot and dry periods. The wax, which forms 
                    a scurfy coating on the stems, is much heavier in the dry 
                    season of the year and during periods of drought. Since average 
                    annual rainfall in the desert where candelilla flourishes 
                    ranges from about 4 to 20 inches, drought is not an uncommon 
                    condition. The moisture-protecting mechanism of the plant 
                    is apparently effective for, as Big Bend writer Virginia Madison 
                    has said, &quot;You seldom see a dead candelilla plant.&quot; 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The summer of 1980 was unusually hot and dry 
                    and many desert plant species such as lechuguilla and Spanish 
                    dagger suffered from desiccation, while candelilla seemed 
                    to suffer very little damage. Plants can be dug up and kept 
                    for long periods of time, and, even after the stems have become 
                    longitudinally wrinkled, the plant will recover when replanted 
                    in the soil. When cut or broken, the stems &quot;bleed&quot; 
                    a white, milky substance, and, if the plants are harvested 
                    by cutting, the root systems will die. </p>
                  <p class="text">According to a 1953 study by botanists W.H. 
                    Hodge and H.H. Sineath, candelilla is the second most important 
                    vegetable wax after carnauba, which is extracted from a Brazilian 
                    palm. About ten tons of the plant can be harvested per acre 
                    where it grows abundantly, far less in most harvest areas. 
                    Since primitive wax-extraction methods produce a yield of 
                    only about 2 percent of plant weight, the refiner who marketed 
                    one million pounds of wax in a good year was representing 
                    exploitation of about 50 million pounds of wild plants from 
                    2,500 to 5,000 acres of desert. Five or ten times that much 
                    wax may be imported annually from Mexico, representing denuding 
                    of perhaps as much as 50,000 acres of desert of candelilla 
                    growth. Can any desert species survive this magnitude of exploitation? 
                    Apparently candelilla has done fairly well, because wax production 
                    continues after seventy years. </p>
                  <p class="text">The plants need from two to five years of growth 
                    before they produce significant wax. When we asked many informants 
                    familiar with wax making and marketing how long it took for 
                    candelilla growth to return in an area that has been intensively 
                    harvested, the estimates ranged from five years to fifty years. 
                    All of these estimates may be accurate for different areas 
                    and conditions. Wax refiner David Adams was more specific 
                    and said that after a first harvesting the candelilla will 
                    return in some abundance in two years; after a second harvesting 
                    it takes about five years for candelilla to come back; and 
                    after a third harvesting it might take ten years for there 
                    to be enough plants for economical harvesting. He said in 
                    some areas of northern Mexico they have depleted the candelilla 
                    through overexploitation and are now using pickaxes to pull 
                    out lechuguilla and greasewood in order to get the small amount 
                    of candelilla growing around those plants. In normal harvesting 
                    they would pull out the candelilla that is easy to recover 
                    and leave plants in and around lechuguilla to help the stand 
                    grow back. </p>
                  <p class="text">In recent years the hearty plant has been transported 
                    widely as an ornamental, and it is reported to grow more robustly 
                    than in the native habitat but to produce little or no wax 
                    under protected conditions. Cultivation of candelilla for 
                    wax production has been attempted in Haiti, Cuba, and the 
                    Dominican Republic but these efforts have failed. A local 
                    informant said he was involved in an expensive experiment 
                    to grow candelilla near Laredo, Texas. The land was prepared 
                    and the candelilla was planted and &quot;grew like weeds,&quot; 
                    but when the enthusiastic entrepreneurs began harvesting, 
                    they found the plants produced almost no wax. Other attempts 
                    at cultivation and mechanical harvesting of candelilla in 
                    the Presidio area were equally unsuccessful. Harvesting native 
                    stands of the plant and processing the wax under primitive 
                    conditions remains the best and perhaps only method of extracting 
                    candelilla wax. </p>
                  <p class="text">Despite the failure of cultivation efforts and 
                    continued exploitation of the wild plant, candelilla probably 
                    will not be threatened with extinction. Some plants will grow 
                    back from remnant root fragments, and others grow in inaccessible 
                    niches where gathering is impractical. However, some scientists 
                    fear that, after harvesting, candelilla may never return to 
                    its original abundance and balance in the vegetation community. 
                    The impact of the weed harvesting on the desert environment 
                    in general and on associated sensitive plant communities in 
                    particular is a matter of concern to biologists in the Chihuahuan 
                    Desert. </p>
                  <h3><a name="2"></a>Harvesting the Plant </h3>
                  <p class="text">Various attempts to harvest candelilla with 
                    mowing machines and bulldozers have failed. It seems that 
                    two strong hands, a bent back, and a burro are still the best 
                    way to gather the plant economically. The gatherers (<em>arrieros</em>) 
                    arise in the wax camps at dawn, and after a breakfast of coffee 
                    and tortillas, each man rounds up his hobbled burros and prepares 
                    from four to six animals for the day's work. Each burro gets 
                    a small wooden packsaddle (called a <em>fuste</em>, or occasionally 
                    <em>aparejo</em>), and, if the man is careful with his animals, 
                    a saddle blanket (<em>corona</em>) of burlap. </p>
                  <p class="text">One informant said he had seen burros with large 
                    galled spots on their backs from carrying burdens without 
                    proper padding under the saddles. The man will ride on a favorite 
                    burro, behind the packsaddle, and carry a bag of tortillas 
                    with frijoles and chiles, and a plastic bleach bottle of river 
                    water. He may travel from a few hundred yards to as much as 
                    five miles, depending on how long the camp has been active, 
                    in order to find good candelilla growth. When a slope with 
                    good growth is located, he hobbles the burros and begins the 
                    hard, solitary work of &quot;pulling weed.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">The plants are usually pulled up by hand, but 
                    a sharpened stick may be used as a primitive spading fork. 
                    After dirt and rocks are shaken from the roots, the plants 
                    are thrown into wind-rows until a large quantity has been 
                    gathered. Then a rope 10 to 12 feet long (called a <em>mecate</em>) 
                    made in a local <em>fabrica</em> from lechuguilla fiber is laid 
                    out on the ground, and the plants are carefully stacked on 
                    it with root ends alternating with tips. About 50 to 80 pounds 
                    of plants are tied in a bundle with each rope, using a <em>honda</em> 
                    to facilitate cinching and quick release of the load. Later 
                    in the day the burros are rounded up, and four bundles of 
                    weed are tied on the packsaddle of each animal. </p>
                  <p class="text">When asked how much candelilla can be carried 
                    by each burro, one <em>candelillero</em> (wax worker, or <em>cerero</em>) 
                    responded: &quot;That depends entirely on the conscience of 
                    the man&#151;one man may put 250 or even 300 pounds on a burro, 
                    while another man will never put over 150 pounds on his animals.&quot; 
                    So six burros and one man may bring in 1,200 pounds of weed 
                    which, when processed, will yield about 24 pounds of wax. 
                    The weed is stacked in orderly piles in the camp and may be 
                    stockpiled for days or weeks until it is time for it to be 
                    boiled for removal of the wax.</p>
                  <p class="text">The wax gatherers pull all of the accessible 
                    plants they can find in an area before they move on to another 
                    stand of plants, so a broad band around each wax camp is denuded 
                    of plants before the camp is moved to another location along 
                    the river. In the past, the gatherers commonly forded the 
                    river and gathered weed indiscriminately in Texas and Mexico, 
                    taking no particular note of ranch or park boundaries unless 
                    forced to do so.</p>
                  <p class="text">Over the years, the National Park Service has 
                    increased efforts to control illegal harvesting of candelilla 
                    in Big Bend National Park. In May 1980 a park official said 
                    they had caught a large burro train loaded with candelilla 
                    on Mesa de Anguila. The <em>cereros</em> (or candelilleros) 
                    were carrying candelilla down a treacherous trail and across 
                    the river to a wax camp about two miles up a tributary toward 
                    San Carlos. The burros were confiscated and the men turned 
                    over to Mexican authorities. These cereros were double smugglers&#151;carrying 
                    weed out of the park and across the river to their camp and 
                    then bringing the extracted wax back across the river to a 
                    buyer.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The Park Service planned other raids on wax 
                    operations during the 1980s study. A camp on the Mexican side 
                    of the river in Boquillas Canyon was sending burro trains 
                    up a tributary canyon on the U.S. side to gather weed in the 
                    park. The Park Service planned to have enforcement personnel 
                    go down the river, seal off the trail, and trap the gatherers 
                    in the park with heavy loads of candelilla. Increased poaching 
                    of candelilla in the park is another indication that the weed 
                    is being overexploited in Mexico.</p>

                    Ashes are scooped or scraped from the firebox and thrown aside. 
                    The vat is cleaned of dirt and debris from previous firings 
                    and filled to within six or eight inches of the top with river 
                    water. An average vat will hold from 200 to 300 gallons of 
                    water, which is carried from the river in five-gallon cans. 
                    The same water, with some added at each firing, may be used 
                    for eight or nine days before the vat is emptied and cleaned.

                    with matches and paper or dried creosote bush. Soon a roaring 
                    fire is burning beneath the vat, and gray smoke billows out 
                    of a chimney made from a steel drum. Additional forkloads 
                    of dry weed must be added to the fire every five or ten minutes 
                    during the firing, and occasionally a long-handled shovel 
                    (<em>paila grande</em>) is used to remove some of the growing

                  <p class="text">A high mound of candelilla is forked onto the 
                    water in the vat. Two men climb on top of the load and, while 
                    holding onto the open grates (<em>parillas</em>), they stomp 
                    and tromp the weed down to water level. Their shoes occasionally 
                    encounter the acid water, thus partly accounting for the large 
                    number of discarded shoes around wax camps. Then an additional 
                    six-inch layer of candelilla plants is placed carefully, lying 
                    horizontally, over the top of the vat). When these plants 
                    are tromped down, no loose ends will protrude above the water 
                    and interfere with scooping the wax. A smooth stick about 
                    four feet in length is used to push all loose plant ends down 
                    in the corners and along the edges of the vat. </p>
                  <p class="text">The vat is now charged with as much as <em>500</em> 
                    pounds of weed. The grates then are pushed down on the neatly 
                    tucked load of weed, and a clamp is placed across the center 
                    of the vat. A gallon jug is opened and two cans of acid (<em>acido 
                    obscuro</em> or <em>sulfurico</em>) are poured on the packed 
                    weed. A pipe handle is placed on the clamp, and two men push 
                    it down, completely submerging the weed. A large rock is then 
                    used to hold the pipe in place. Soon the contents of the vat 
                    begin to boil and bubble and a brown foam of wax appears on 
                    the acid water. </p>

                    hole in the ground, or on the ground surface inside a dampened 
                    earthen dike. The hot foam separates as it is scooped into 
                    the mold, and the brownish water sinks to the bottom. Above 
                    the water is a layer of smooth, yellow cerote about the consistency

                    a three- or four-inch-thick layer, it can be broken out easily. 
                    At one camp, molds made from steel drums cut lengthwise were 
                    used because the wax cake was easier to dislodge from these 
                    half-cylinders. One cerero said he always molded wax in the 
                    ground because it hardened quicker, was easy to dislodge from 
                    the hole, and weighed slightly more because of adhering sand.</p>

                  <p class="text">The skimmer continues to skim wax from the vat 
                    every few minutes for a period of about 20 minutes. Then an 
                    extra can of acid is poured into the boiling water to increase 
                    the wax yield. A cerero said a gallon of acid will serve five 
                    or six vats of weed and is expected to yield about sixty to 
                    eighty pounds of raw wax.</p>
                  <p class="text">After about half an hour the candelilla has 
                    yielded most of its wax. A handful of ashes is dropped into 
                    the corners of the vat opposite the skimming. This causes 
                    a violent reaction that drives the last traces of wax to the 
                    end of the vat, where they are scooped out. Wax makers never 
                    waste even small amounts of the valuable wax.. </p>
                  <p class="text">When the man in charge is convinced that no 
                    more wax will come from the load, cold water is added to bring 
                    the liquid level to within an inch of the top of the vat. 
                    The grates are then released from the clamp and thrown back, 
                    and a soggy mass of spent weed rises from the vat. If the 
                    men have no wheelbarrow, they lay two long, smooth poles parallel 
                    on the ground beside the vat and a mound of wet weed is forked 
                    onto the poles. The men then carry the load a few yards and 
                    dump it on a mound of drying spent weed, which will eventually 
                    be used as fuel.</p>
                  <p class="text">More dry weed is stoked under the vat while 
                    fresh candelilla is being forked onto the water in the vat&#151;and 
                    the process begins again. Since the water level in the vat 
                    was just right before the spent weed was removed, it will 
                    again be right when the vat is recharged. It never overflows. 
                    This process is repeated over and over until the stacks of 
                    candelilla and the men are exhausted.</p>
                  <p class="text">Worker Ramon Riojas said he expected to get 
                    twelve pounds of wax from each vatload of weed. Since thirty 
                    minutes are spent on each vat load, he might produce 240 pounds 
                    of wax in a ten-hour day. At $1.50 per pound (market price 
                    1980), this wax could be worth about $360 when refined. Ramon 
                    probably gets about ten cents per pound, or $24 per day.</p>
                  <p class="text">When the cakes of cerote are hardened, they 
                    are removed from the molds and broken into angular chunks 
                    with a hammerstone .The wax chunks are placed in burlap bags, 
                    which are then crudely sewn shut with cordage. The valuable 
                    bags of cerote may then be hidden in a safe place nearby; 
                    we have never seen them stacked in camp. Perhaps in some secluded 
                    rock niche they are safer from brushfires, government agents, 
                    and bandits. </p>

                  <p class="text">Cerote as it comes in from the camps along the 
                    river is unsuitable for marketing and must be refined. In 
                    recent decades all wax refining and marketing in west Texas 
                    has been done by J.E. Casner and David Adams. </p>
                  <p class="text">Casner described the following process as practiced 
                    in his Alpine refinery in 1976. The two large, circular steel 
                    vats have flat bottoms and are about 10 feet (3 m) in diameter 
                    and 6.5 feet (2 m) in depth. These vats rest in a large firebox 
                    made of fire-bricks. Butane heating elements apply flames 
                    to the bases of the vats, and the wax melts at about 160 degrees 
                    F. The heat must be carefully monitored and controlled to 
                    prevent boil overs. About 5,500 pounds (wax is weighed in 
                    pounds; 1 lb. equals .4536 kg) of cerote is placed in each 
                    vat with about 10 feet of water in the bottom to keep it from 
                    scorching. The vats are heated for five to six hours to drive 
                    off all moisture from the wax and let sand settle to the bottom. 
                    The floor of the building immediately in front of the vats 
                    is smooth, well-waxed concrete and is divided into shallow, 
                    square septa by steel bulkheads that are about 8 inches high. 
                    The hot wax is drained through pipes into these shallow floor 
                    &quot;cells&quot; to cool in about 3-inch-thick layers.</p>
                  <p class="text">About 2 inches of residue in the bottom of each 
                    big vat is dipped into a smaller rectangular vat, where it 
                    is boiled in about two feet of water. The wax is left to harden 
                    on top of the water and is then broken out and placed in the 
                    next batch in the big vats. Dregs from the bottom of the rectangular 
                    tank are discarded. The refined wax on the floor cools overnight 
                    and forms four solid cakes of wax about 10 feet by 16 feet 
                    in size and 3 inches in thickness. These wax cakes are pried 
                    up the following day and broken into fist-size chunks with 
                    ball-peen hammers. The angular chunks of refined wax are then 
                    placed in new burlap bags (ca. 100 pounds each), and the bags 
                    are sewn shut for shipping.</p>
                  <p class="text">In a 1980 interview, Adams described a similar 
                    refining plant at his ranch on the Rio Grande.</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>We take the crude wax and boil it with 
                      a little bit of sulphuric acid, and boil the water out of 
                      it, and then just let it set until the dirt and stuff like 
                      that settles to the bottom. And then we pour it out of the 
                      vat into cooling platforms and let it cool. And we change 
                      the color from a whitish color to a kind of tan or brown 
                      which is the difference in the moisture content. We sell 
                      a refined wax. It's just nearly pure wax. When we buy it, 
                      it has about 10 percent dirt and water mixed up. </em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">Adams said he bought his big refining vat from 
                    Asa Jones. Asa told Adams he paid $50 for the vat and had 
                    used it for years, so Adams thought he might buy it &quot;used&quot; 
                    for about $20. Instead, Asa said because of inflation it had 
                    increased in value to $150, and that was what it cost. </p>
                  <p class="text">Ramon Riojas, foreman on the Adams Ranch, said 
                    they put about 3,500 pounds of cerote in the big vat and use 
                    butane burners to heat it. When the wax is sufficiently cooked, 
                    it is drained onto the cooling floors in the barn out of the 
                    sun and rain. He said the floors retain heat, so it is necessary 
                    to alternate between them so one of them can cool and thereby 
                    cool the wax more quickly. Once the refined wax cools, it 
                    is broken up with bars and hammers and bagged in new burlap 
                    bags (<em>costal</em>). The wax is carefully weighed and exactly 
                    138 pounds of refined wax is put in each two-pound sack, for 
                    a total weight of 140 pounds per bag. At the time of our visit 
                    there was about 15,000 pounds of wax at the refinery, and 
                    Riojas was very proud that it was &quot;wax produced by Ramon.&quot; 
                    He provided us with fragments of cerote and refined wax and 
                    assured us that we would find them to be of the highest quality.

                    that is heavier during the dry season (November through March) 
                    and in colder months. Rain, when it does fall, removes some 
                    of the wax from the stems and makes the plants less likely 
                    to produce wax until the area has again dried out. It is said 
                    that an expert wax maker can twist a plant and pull it through 
                    his hands and accurately predict the yield of a stand of candelilla. 
                    Even a novice can twist stems of the plant and find his hands 
                    covered with tiny white flakes of wax..</p>
                  <p class="text">The wax yield is about 1.5 to 2.5 percent of 
                    plant weight. <em>Cerote</em> is the common name of raw wax 
                    as it is brought in from camps along the river. The raw wax 
                    is in large angular chunks, from the size of your fist to 
                    almost as large as your head, weighing about 7 to 35 ounces 
                    (200 to 1,000 grams) each. The cerote chunks are broken from 
                    large molded blocks by percussion and exhibit curved (conchoidal) 
                    fractures on many facets. Raw wax is a dirty buff color and 
                    contains obvious bubbles, sand grains, and fragments of plant 
                    stems and carbon. The refined wax, as marketed, is in percussion-fractured, 
                    angular chunks of a more uniform shape, averaging about 3 
                    by 4 inches in size and weighing about 5 ounces each. These 
                    fragments contain no obvious contaminants, are somewhat heavier 
                    by volume and more dense than cerote, and are a dark caramel 
                    or amber in color. </p>
                  <p class="text">After the wax has been refined, it has a hardness 
                    of between one and two on the mineral scale, as described 
                    by Hare and Bjerregaard in a 1910 journal article, and it 
                    can be scratched easily with your thumbnail. It is harder 
                    and more brittle than beeswax and less so than carnauba. When 
                    candelilla wax is warmed, the odor resembles that of beeswax. 
                    In the sample analyzed by Hare and Bjerregaard, the melting 
                    point was found to be 67 to 68 degrees C (ca. 153 to 154 degrees 
                    F) and the solidifying point, 64.5 degrees C (148.1 degrees 
                    F). They give the refractive index as 1.4555 at 71.5 degrees 
                    C (160.7 degrees F) and compare these and other characteristics 
                    to carnauba, beeswax, and Chinese insect wax. After combustion 
                    the wax yielded 80.3% carbon and 12.69% hydrogen. </p>
                  <p class="text">Wax from plants harvested in the winter has 
                    a higher melting point and is somewhat harder than that obtained 
                    from plants harvested in other seasons. Plants of different 
                    ages are also said to yield wax with slightly different properties. 
                    Candelilla wax is soluble in organic solvents such as acetone, 
                    benzine, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ether, and gasoline&#151;particularly 
                    when the solvents are heated. Alcohol can be used to remove 
                    resins from the wax for purification. (Daugherty, Sineath, 
                    and Wastler in 1953 published an article in the Engineering 
                    Experiment Station Bulletin of the Georgia Institute of Technology 
                    in which five tables of detailed data on wax from several 
                    species of candelilla, including <em>Euphorbia antisyphilitica</em>, 
                    are provided.)</p>
                  <h3><a name="6"></a>Uses for Wax</h3>
                  <p class="text">Few people in this country have ever heard of 
                    candelilla wax and only a handful have seen it being produced, 
                    yet nearly everyone has had personal contact with it. If you 
                    have chewed gum, used cosmetics, worn shoes, ridden horse-back, 
                    polished an auto or an antique, played a phonograph record, 
                    or walked across a dance floor, you have probably encountered 
                    wax from candelilla plants.</p>
                  <p class="text">Traditional or folk uses for the wax include 
                    candles, religious statues, artificial flowers, cloth waterproofing, 
                    leather dressing, chewing gum, dance-floor wax, and coating 
                    for the small wax matches from Mexico. According to W.H Hodge 
                    and H.H. Sineath in a 1956 article in <em>Economic Botany</em>, 
                    candles made from the wax are said to &quot;burn with a bright 
                    light and an agreeable odor.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">Since before World War I, when the wax became 
                    readily available, it has been used extensively in chewing 
                    gum and, more recently, in breath mints. Various big name 
                    companies have used the wax in automobile polish, floor waxes, 
                    furniture polish, and saddle soap. Leather shoes are treated 
                    with the wax to facilitate polishing and prevent squeaking, 
                    and leather-stitching thread is waxed for strength, ease in 
                    sewing, and waterproofing. The wax is used in carbon paper, 
                    parchment, stencil and tracing papers, and as an ingredient 
                    in inks for printing, stamping, and writing. Mixed with gum 
                    elastic and guttapercha, it has been used extensively in electrical 
                    insulation. Fine, high-luster varnishes and lacquers contain 
                    candelilla wax, and various products such as adhesives, cements, 
                    cosmetics, crayons, and lead pencils also contain small amounts.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the world wars when other waxes were 
                    scarce, candelilla wax was indispensable to the military for 
                    waterproofing and insect-proofing tents, tarpaulins, thread, 
                    and fabric. Airplane parts were coated to prevent deterioration 
                    and lessen friction. Some explosives contained small amounts 
                    of wax, and the bags of powder charges for naval guns were 
                    impregnated with it.</p>
                  <p class="text">Candelilla wax has been used as a hardener for 
                    soft waxes and as a dilutant for beeswax and carnauba. It 
                    serves well as an acid-proofing agent in metal etching. Even 
                    unexpected products like linoleum, celluloid, plastics, rubber, 
                    ointments, and paint removers contain small amounts of candelilla 
                    wax. Phonograph records, precision castings, dental castings, 
                    anatomical models, and molded figurines utilize the wax. The 
                    textile industry has used the wax as sizing in fabrics, to 
                    coat thread, and to lessen friction on shuttles in looms.</p>
                  <p class="text">Certainly a product that has been found useful 
                    for such diverse applications probably has been used in dozens 
                    of other industrial products as well. In his 1941<em> Nature 
                    Magazine</em> article, John Whitaker says candelilla wax probably 
                    has more uses than any other product originating from an uncultivated 
                    plant on this continent. And yet, primary production is still 
                    by means of back-breaking labor and burro power.</p>
