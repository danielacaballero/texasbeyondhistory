                  <p class="text"><em>{Editor's Note: This section by historian 
                    and researcher JoAnn Pospisil provides new perspectives on 
                    the wax-making industry, with an update on changes that have 
                    occurred since Curtis Tunnell conducted his study in the 1960s-1970s. 
                    It is based on Pospisil's numerous trips with THC steward 
                    Enrique Madrid to camps predominately in Mexico, where they 
                    visited with accomplished candelilleros, including, surprisingly, 
                    several women.} </em></p>
                  <p class="text"> Candelilla wax remains an important economic 
                    cash commodity in the Big Bend region, especially in the rural 
                    areas of northern Mexico. Tradition plays a strong role in 
                    the methods used by families engaged in the industry. The 
                    most efficient harvesting and field processing practices are 
                    handed down from generation to generation and remain largely 
                    unchanged since commercialization of this natural resource 
                    in 1910. </p>
                  <p class="text">The <em>candelilleros</em> teach their sons and 
                    daughters how plant regeneration is assured by the proper 
                    harvesting techniques, why correct bundling is important for 
                    successful transport of the harvested plant to the processing 
                    camp, how to use a <em>honda</em> to tie the secure slip knot 
                    that will allow the rope around each bundle later to be removed 
                    with ease, and why, when, and how much sulfuric acid or ash 
                    to add to the vat of boiling water from which the candelilla 
                    wax is skimmed.</p>
                  <p class="text">This vegetable resource flourishes at elevations 
                    between 1100 and 3800 feet on well-drained, south-facing limestone 
                    slopes. Through the years, attempts to commercialize plant 
                    production have failed. Irrigation reduces the plant's waxy 
                    protective coating. Mechanical cutting causes the milky sap 
                    to drain and the plant to die, thus lengthening propagation. 
                    The fastest recovery is from rhizomes left in the soil when 
                    the candelilla plant is pulled up by hand. </p>
                  <p class="text">The industry is restricted spatially to the 
                    Chihuahuan Desert's mountainous Big Bend region of Texas and 
                    northern Mexico. Locals report that before the severe drought 
                    in the 1950s there were candelilla stands as thick as wheat. 
                    Harvesting and more recent droughts have diminished this previous 
                    abundance, but recovery continues. Since the organization 
                    of Big Bend National Park in 1944, most of the candelilla 
                    in the United States is protected within the park boundaries. 
                    The majority harvested today comes from Mexico. Although large 
                    expanses of this scenic mountainous terrain were declared 
                    natural areas by the Mexican government, the candelilla plant 
                    is not a protected resource. Candelilla management and recovery 
                    are left to the <em>candelilleros</em> who are given the role 
                    of steward and expected to harvest prudently in order to preserve 
                    the continuing cash potential.</p>
                  <p class="text">Unfortunately, the forced localization of this 
                    relatively primitive industry cannot shield it from the global 
                    political, financial, and social forces governing today's 
                    economy. Erratic market prices, fluctuating demand, and an 
                    unreliable wax supply under Mexican export restrictions and 
                    U. S. tariff policies prompted large industrial consumers 
                    to develop synthetic substitutes for this second-hardest, 
                    naturally occurring vegetable wax. Although demand has declined, 
                    prices have enjoyed a generally upward trend since the 1970s, 
                    as is shown in the graph. </p>
                  <p class="text">In an attempt to gain control of the resource, 
                    the Mexican government nationalized the industry in 1935. 
                    Local government units called <em>municipios</em> were divided 
                    into <em>ejidos</em> with wax production reserved for the resident 
                    ejidatarios. Large commercial producers employing their own 
                    crews simultaneously were given permits to harvest and process 
                    candelilla. </p>
                  <p class="text">This created a treacherous environment for the 
                    competing independent producers whose camp locations were 
                    disclosed to the more powerful commercial interests by American 
                    buyers, among others, in exchange for bribes and kickbacks. 
                    These small operations often were destroyed with the workers 
                    sometimes thrown into the fire or brutally restrained while 
                    their camp was burned, equipment demolished, and burros shot. 
                    Mexican rangers called forestales demolished any camps found 
                    in close proximity to the river because they automatically 
                    assumed an intent to smuggle the wax directly across the Rio 
                    Grande. </p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="text">Curtis Tunnell visited some of the riverside 
                    camps during initial survey and study of the candelilla wax 
                    industry and observed in his 1981 report that &quot;there 
                    is a conspicuous absence of women.&quot; However, in subsequent 
                    research, I have found that women often participated in the 
                    industry, and these female <em>candelilleras</em> harvested 
                    and processed candelilla alongside their fathers, grandfathers, 
                    brothers and husbands. There is no stigma attached to female 
                    participation although the form and extent varies according 
                    to local custom. </p>
                  <p class="text">Some candelillera tasks include harvesting, 
                    handling the burros in camp and during candelilla transport, 
                    cooking food for the crew, carrying water to fill the processing 
                    vat, stomping the candelilla to pack it tightly in the vat, 
                    skimming wax, and removing the spent plant from the vat and 
                    stacking this <em>yerba seca</em> [literally, dried herb] away 
                    from the processing area. <em>Candelilleras</em> generally are 
                    strong-willed, stoic, and somewhat non-conformist with a love 
                    of the outdoors. The likelihood of violent confrontations 
                    with <em>forestales</em> probably accounts for the absence of 
                    women in camps near the river.</p>
                  <p class="text">Historically, field processed candelilla wax, 
                    called <em>cerote</em>, was sold legally into the U. S. anywhere 
                    along the Rio Grande to American buyers who generally paid 
                    higher prices and in cash. The wax then was declared as soon 
                    as possible at a formal port of entry. Both <em>candelilleros</em> 
                    and U. S. buyers recount colorful incidents related to this 
                    &quot;direct&quot; import across the Rio Grande which clashed 
                    in mid-river with Mexican export restrictions that required 
                    all wax to be sold through the Mexican National Bank.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the 1990s the North American Free Trade Agreement 
                    [NAFTA] eroded the independent production supported and encouraged 
                    by the <em>ejido</em> system. NAFTA privatized the industry 
                    which caused more centralization and increasing control by 
                    large commercial interests. In 1996 all Class B informal Rio 
                    Grande border crossings were closed by the U. S. government. 
                    <em>Candelilleros</em> in northern Mexican villages like Manuel 
                    Benavides [San Carlos], Boquillas, Jaboncillos and Las Norias 
                    found their small profit margin could not support transporting 
                    the wax to the relatively distant formal ports of entry at 
                    Presidio and Del Rio [see map]. These imposed market conditions 
                    forced the independent producers to sell their cerote to local 
                    Mexican buyers.</p>
                  <p class="text">The generally lax enforcement of the 1996 Class 
                    B crossing closings ended following September 11, 2001. Presidio 
                    and Del Rio then in reality became the only legal entry points 
                    in the Big Bend region. This caused crucial tourist dollars 
                    to vanish from the economies of border villages like Boquillas, 
                    Santa Elena, and Paso Lajitas. Candelilla harvesting and wax 
                    production escalated because the candellilla wax trade became 
                    critical as the remaining legal means for participation in 
                    a cash economy. Other alternatives for replacing lost tourist 
                    dollars are not acceptable to most citizens. One option is 
                    the costly special work permit for U. S. employment along 
                    the border, perhaps in the expanding Lajitas resort. Another 
                    more lucrative but illegal and dangerous choice is drug trafficking.</p>
                  <p class="text">Today most <em>cerote</em> is sold to Mexican 
                    buyers and warehoused in Mexico. Larger lots then are exported 
                    to U. S. buyers/brokers through Presidio or Del Rio, or directly 
                    to commercial consumers in the northeastern U. S., or to newly 
                    developed markets in Germany and Japan. Current prices are 
                    considerably higher than historically and often not competitive 
                    for U. S. buyers. For the past three years, Mexican buyers 
                    in the State of Chihuahua paid candelilleros 27 pesos [minus 
                    3 pesos for social services] per kilogram, almost $6 per pound 
                    at the exchange rate of 10 pesos per U. S. dollar.</p>
                  <p class="text">With proper management, candelilla is a renewable 
                    natural resource with myriad uses in our everyday lives [see 
                    chart]. Candelilla's conservation and managed commercial exploitation 
                    is becoming increasingly important as the population continues 
                    to swell along the northern Mexican border, and survival in 
                    this arid environment with its paucity of resources becomes 
                    ever more tentative. The economic and cultural manifestations 
                    of the <em>candelilleros</em>' proud traditions have withstood 
                    past market assaults and, despite an uncertain future, the 
                    candelilla wax industry remains an important economic mainstay 
                    unique to the Big Bend region.</p>
