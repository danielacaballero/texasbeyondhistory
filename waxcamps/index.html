                    <span class="text">In the 1960s and 1970s, Texas Historical 
                    Commission archeologists surveying the rugged west Texas lands 
                    along the Rio Grande river encountered a fascinating small-scale 
                    industry centered around an inconspicuous wild plant known 
                    as <em>candelilla</em>. </span><span class="text">While growth 
                    of the stalky, leafless plant is ruled largely by the whims 
                    of nature, the harvesting and extraction of the product&#151;a 
                    high-quality wax&#151;is dependent solely upon the ingenuity 
                    and sweat of Mexican laborers following decades-old traditions. 
                    </span></p>
                  <p><span class="text">Then as now, the industry seems almost 
                    shockingly primitive in our crisply modern and mechanized 
                    world, particularly given the value and world-wide usage of 
                    the product. Wax makers (<em>candelilleros</em>)&#151;many of 
                    them working alone in remote areas&#151;cut massive stacks 
                    of the weed by hand, then boil it in jerry-rigged metal vats 
                    to extract the wax. Once cured, the raw wax is stuffed into 
                    huge burlap bags and hauled down dusty trails on the backs 
                    of small burros. Although a few workers have acquired trucks 
                    to expedite the process, paying for gasoline is another matter, 
                    and there are no trucks to equal the nimble burros in areas 
                    where there are no roads.</span></p>
                  <p><span class="text"> From these crude origins, the wax is 
                    delivered to buyers, refined in factories, and ultimately 
                    distributed into an international market where it will become 
                    a key ingredient in floor wax, cosmetics, candles, chewing 
                    gum, and other items. Though unknown to most of us, candelilla 
                    wax has touched all our lives in a small way through products 
                    such as these. </span></p>
                  <p class="text">The late Curtis Tunnell, former State Archeologist 
                    of Texas and Executive Director of the Texas Historical Commission, 
                    was a leader of those early survey expeditions along the Rio 
                    Grande. Over a decade's time, he developed a fascination with 
                    the industry and an abiding admiration for the self-reliant 
                    wax makers. His conversations, interviews, and research led 
                    to a remarkable study published by the commission in 1981. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In the following exhibits, we take a look at 
                    the wax makers and their way of life as Tunnell observed and 
                    wrote about them roughly two decades ago. The text of his 
                    report is followed closely throughout. In the <a href="intro.html" class="text"><strong>Introduction</strong></a>, 
                    we learn how an archeological survey project was transformed 
                    into a much richer, transcultural experience. The <a href="history.html" class="text"><strong>History</strong></a> 
                    section tracks the wax-making industry back to the turn of 
                    the century when enterprising businessmen with an eye for 
                    new opportunities moved onto the desert frontier. In &quot;From 
                    Desert Plants to Dollars,&quot; a fully illustrated <a href="techniques.html" class="text"><strong>Techniques</strong></a><strong> 
                    </strong>section takes the reader step-by-step through the wax-making 
                    process, followed by a look at the resourceful <a href="candel.html" class="text"><strong>Candelilleros</strong></a> 
                    and their camps&#151;fascinating constructions of desert plant 
                    materials and scavenged metal containers.</p>

                    Pospisil provides an update on the <a href="today.html" class="text"><strong>current 
                    state of the wax-making industry</strong></a> and new perspectives 
                    on traditionally held views about women's roles in the process. 
                    New restrictions and trade agreements such as NAFTA as well 
                    as border closings following the events of Septempber 11, 
                    2001, have necessitated a number of shifts in the way the 
                    workers now operate.</p>
                  <p class="text">Finally, in <a href="tunnell.html" class="text">Tunnell's 
                    Journey</a>, we look back over the life and career of Curtis 
                    Tunnell through recollections and tributes of some of his 
                    friends and colleagues at the THC. </p>
                  <p class="text">The exhibits are illustrated by Tunnell's exceptional 
                    black and white photos and the charming drawings by Sharon 
                    Roos of the THC. New photos by Pospisil, Big Bend wildlife 
                    biologist Raymond Skiles, and others bring color and additional 
                    views of the industry, the people, and the ruggedly beautiful 
                    west Texas landscape to the presentation.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Wax Camps exhibits on <em>Texas Beyond History</em> 
                    were supported by a grant through the <strong>Curtis Tunnell Memorial 
                    Award, Friends of the Texas Historical Commission</strong>. In 
                    these exhibits, <em>TBH </em> reflects Tunnell's appreciation 
                    for lesser-known, traditional cultures and pushes across political 
                    and geographic boundaries to provide a larger, more-meaningful 
                    context for understanding our state's rich cultural heritage.</p>
