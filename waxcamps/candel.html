                        <h3>Wax Makers: Conditions and Wages </h3>
                        <p class="text">Wax makers are called <em>cereros</em> or 
                          <em>candelilleros </em>or occasionally <em>paileros</em> 
                          and are always men. There is a conspicuous absence of 
                          women in the camps. The occupation of wax maker is one 
                          that many men along the border have practiced at one 
                          time or another, and a few men work at the wax vats 
                          for years.</p>
                        <p class="text">All wax makers come from Mexico. You couldn't 
                          get people in this country to make wax if it was worth 
                          five dollars per pound. You can't just hire anyone to 
                          make wax, they need to have had experience. It is very 
                          hard work and relatively few men can do it well. The 
                          men have to have tough hands and a strong back to pull 
                          candelilla. They never use gloves and you can tell by 
                          looking at their hands if a man has worked with wax 
                          a long time. According to Davis Adams in a 1980 interview, 
                          experienced men can get more wax from each ton of weed 
                          and get more wax with less acid. </p>
                        <p class="text">Some of the cereros are family men who 
                          travel back to their villages&#151;Las Norias, Boquillas, 
                          Santa Elena, El Mulato&#151;periodically to visit their 
                          families, attend mass, and get supplies. Others are 
                          young men who are wanting to learn a trade, earn sufficient 
                          money to go to a city like Ojinaga or Juarez, or, more 
                          likely, head north as illegal aliens. A few are drifters 
                          or men outside the law and are hostile toward strangers 
                          with cameras or hide in the rocks to avoid such contacts.</p>
                        <p class="text">Generally cereros work eight to ten hours 
                          per day and six days per week. Sometimes the men will 
                          work for 20 or 30 days straight and then quit and go 
                          to nearby towns &quot;to see the girls and get alcohol.&quot; 
                          They also like to observe all manner of religious and 
                          political holidays. Some men may go well down into Mexico 
                          to visit family or attend weddings. Their usual mode 
                          of travel is by burro or &quot;they just walk.&quot;</p>
                        <p class="text">A good wax maker can gather the plants 
                          for, and extract about 1,000 pounds of wax per month 
                          if he works at it. One man can make wax by himself, 
                          doing everything from gathering the plants to the final 
                          boiling and bagging, but usually at least two men work 
                          together. Men of the same family (for example, a man 
                          and his sons or several brothers) often work together 
                          on a crew.' When the price is right the men produce 
                          wax the year round; however, slightly more wax is produced 
                          in winter than in summer.</p>
                        <p class="text">The men are paid a little more if they 
                          provide their own burros, but a foreman or rancher always 
                          has extra burros on hand. When asked the price of a 
                          burro, one informant said: &quot;If you are wanting 
                          to buy a burro it is always worth $100, and if you are 
                          wanting to sell one it is always worth $25.&quot; He 
                          estimated a good average price in 1980 to be about $50.</p>
                        <p class="text">Adams said wax makers on his ranch will 
                          work hard until they have made $200 or $300 in a month, 
                          then they begin to slack off. If they worked hard all 
                          month they could make as much as $600, but they don't 
                          seem interested in making as much money as possible 
                          each month. He believes that, generally, the standard 
                          of living of the wax makers is much better than it used 
                          to be, and that &quot;some day if Mexico becomes sufficiently 
                          affluent, no one will want to produce candelilla wax.,&quot; 
                          Adams said. &quot;You gotta have a commissary if you're 
                          going to produce wax.&quot; He said he always sells 
                          groceries to the men because they have no other place 
                          to get them. &quot;You can't just provide them with 
                          food because if you do they will use a pound of coffee 
                          per day, but when they have to buy it themselves a pound 
                          of coffee will last them for a week.&quot; </p>
                        <p class="text">The most common items which he sells to 
                          the men include coffee, beans, potatoes, flour, black 
                          pepper, salt, canned tomatoes, vermicelli, lard, roll-your-own 
                          tobacco, onions, and chile peppers. He said it is rare 
                          for the men to have meat, but occasionally they may 
                          have a chicken or a goat if those can be acquired cheaply 
                          from a nearby homestead. They also kill javelina hogs 
                          on the ranch but are not permitted to kill deer. Traps 
                          are used by the men, since they are not permitted to 
                          have guns on the ranch. Adams said that, since he also 
                          forbids the wax makers to have liquor, things are fairly 
                          quiet on the ranch.</p>
                        <h3 class="text">Adaptation and Improvisation</h3>
                        <p class="text">Cereros take little in the way of material 
                          possessions with them to the camp. An iron wax vat with 
                          grate, burros and packsaddles, machetes, burlap bags, 
                          rope, jars of acid, a few cooking pots, staple food, 
                          and a change of clothes make up the usual inventory. 
                          The men are masters at improvisation, adaptation, and 
                          &quot;living off the land.&quot; This is perhaps best 
                          illustrated by the shelters that they find or fabricate. 
                          The cereros' use of the candelilla is especially noteworthy, 
                          for not only does the plant produce the wax and provide 
                          fuel for the vats, the wax makers also use it for their 
                          beds and as thatching for various types of shelters. 
                          The types of shelters and their methods of construction 
                          are discussed in the section on camps below.</p>
                        <p class="text">Candelilleros fabricate many of the tools 
                          they use for work, the implements they use in cooking, 
                          and even the clothing they wear. Pack saddles often 
                          are made from pieces of driftwood held together with 
                          rope, pegs, and salvaged nails. An acid dipper consists 
                          of a small can or jar tied in the fork of a stick. A 
                          wax skimmer is made from a flattened tin can perforated 
                          with a nail and attached to a handle with wire and nails. 
                          Pitchforks for stoking candelilla into the fire are 
                          carved from forked mesquite branches. If no wheelbarrow 
                          is available, candelilla is stacked on two parallel 
                          poles and carried between two men.</p>
                        <p class="text"> A griddle for tortillas is made by cutting 
                          the flat end from a steel drum. Wooden pegs are cut 
                          and driven into shelter walls for hanging clothing and 
                          food. A hanging wire serves to keep food out of the 
                          reach of rats. Sandals are fabricated from the tread 
                          of old tires, and shoes may be repaired and reused as 
                          long as bent nails will sustain them. Leggings of raw 
                          goat skins are sometimes used to reduce the painful 
                          wounds inflicted by lechuguilla and Spanish daggers 
                          on the gathering slopes. Plastic bleach bottles lost 
                          by fishermen are the usual water canteens seen around 
                          camps and carried on burros.<br>
                          One informant, Bob Burleson, described an example of 
                          spontaneous inventiveness:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                          <p class="text"><em>I was walking with a wax collector 
                            one time when the candelilla load began to shift on 
                            the burro. The man stepped over to a torre yucca and 
                            stripped off some fibers with his fingernail and twisted 
                            them into a crude cord and tied the candelilla load 
                            to the packsaddle more securely.</em></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="text">Sotol and lechuguilla are readily available 
                          sources of good fibers for twisting into twine and rope, 
                          which are used in the harvesting of the weed, fabrication 
                          of bags and shelters, repair of tools and clothing, 
                          and for many other purposes. We have seen piles of leaves 
                          and quids from both species where hungry cereros have 
                          baked the plants in hot ashes at the front of fire pits 
                          and feasted on the nourishing hearts. Our field party 
                          baked hearts of both plants in an earth oven for 20 
                          hours and found them to be soft, quite palatable, and 
                          almost tasty.</p>
                        <p class="text">For the most part the wax makers have 
                          been friendly and cooperative with our field crews, 
                          permitting us freely to take photographs, ask numerous 
                          questions in broken Spanish, wander around camp, draw 
                          maps, and pet burros. An occasional small <em>mordida</em> 
                          of cold beer or money improved communications and helped 
                          compensate the workers for time lost in conversation.</p>

                        <h3>Location and Features </h3>
                        <p class="text">Rarely, a wax operation may be set up 
                          sufficiently near a settlement that the men can commute 
                          from their homes to the production area, but most such 
                          locations were exhausted long ago. By far the most common 
                          pattern is for several men, three or four to eight or 
                          ten, to take their vats and donkeys into a remote can-yon 
                          area where candelilla is abundant and establish a camp, 
                          which they may use continuously for months and intermittently 
                          for years.</p>
                        <p class="text">A few camps may be found near springs, 
                          tinajas (potholes), or windmills, but the majority, 
                          even those in out-of-the-way places in the canyons, 
                          are located near the river. The camps occur on both 
                          sides of the Rio Grande and seem to be situated according 
                          to convenience with no consideration of the international 
                          boundary. The vats usually are placed immediately beside 
                          the river on the first terrace, about 6 or 7 feet above 
                          normal river flow and 10 to 12 feet back from the terrace 
                          edge. Living areas may be from 30 to 100 feet farther 
                          back on the same level but are more often on the edge 
                          of the second silt terrace. The area of the camps varies 
                          from about a quarter acre to as much as two acres, with 
                          most of the area devoted to stockpiles of candelilla 
                          awaiting processing and spent weed drying for fuel. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">The most prominent features in the camps 
                          include vats and firepits, deeply worn trails, piles 
                          of ashes, sleeping shelters, candelilla stock-piles, 
                          <em>yerba seca</em> (cooked candelilla) piles, sun-shades 
                          or<em> ramadas</em> of various types, brush fences, and 
                          burned areas in brush and cane along the river. The 
                          most obvious activity area in a camp is the area where 
                          the weed is processed. The living area where the men 
                          sleep and cook is also clearly delimited in most camps. 
                          Occasionally there may be an area where the burros are 
                          maintained. Trash seems to be scattered randomly about 
                          rather than deposited in a systematic way.</p>
                        <h3>Work Organization </h3>
                        <p class="text">There are various types of organization 
                          in the wax camps. Some camps are composed of several 
                          individuals who gather weed for themselves and take 
                          a &quot;turn&quot; at the wax pit when they have stockpiled 
                          sufficient candelilla. Other camps, especially those 
                          on <em>ejidos</em>, consist of a group of men working 
                          in common and sharing in the profits of the operation. 
                          A few camps belong to one man, a rancher or<em> jefe</em>, 
                          who pays wages or a commission on the wax to the workers. 
                          Adams said there were from five to seven camps producing 
                          wax on his ranch in 1980, and these are operated according 
                          to a modified commission plan. He has a foreman who 
                          buys wax from the camps and then sells it to Adams, 
                          and the man makes about 10 cents per pound for the transaction, 
                          Adams finds it necessary to buy the wax by the sack 
                          even though it is produced on his land, because if he 
                          paid the candelilleros to produce it, he would not get 
                          as much for his money. Buying wax produced from his 
                          own weed costs the same per pound as wax brought from 
                          Mexico.</p>
                        <p class="text">Job assignments in the camps vary. In 
                          some, men seem to have particular jobs&#151;stoking 
                          the fire, carrying water, skimming the vat, breaking 
                          wax blocks, bagging cerote&#151;and the jobs have different 
                          status within the group. In other camps chaos seems 
                          to reign, with different men doing different jobs at 
                          different times and some obviously doing more than their 
                          fair share. There often is one older man, the master 
                          wax maker, who is nominally in charge.</p>

                          In some areas, small cavities and crevices in limestone 
                          serve as individual living units, which may be furnished

                          cliffs provide partial shelter for camps and storage

                          niches and pegs for storage and unlimited potential 
                          for graffiti. The roofs are made with wooden support

                          interspersed with cardboard and rags. Candelilla beds

                        <h3>Wax Vats </h3>
                        <p class="text">Like the shelters improvised by the workers, 
                          the equipment used in making wax varies from camp to 
                          camp and according to circumstance. A large wax vat 
                          (called a <em>paila</em> or occasionally <em>caldera</em> 
                          by the cereros) may be made from half a steel boiler 
                          cut lengthwise or fabricated from sheet steel in a welding 
                          shop in one of the larger cities. In some camps the 
                          vats are provided by the wax refiner and do not belong 
                          to the cereros who use them. The vats vary in size and 
                          shape but may be about 6 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 
                          3 feet in depth. A heavy steel grate is attached at 
                          either end by loop hinges and, after much stomping to 
                          submerge the weed, a lever clamps the grate at the center 
                          to hold the load in place until the wax is boiled off. 
                          The vats and grates can be used for years, although 
                          they frequently need patching or small repairs.</p>
                        <p class="text">A small wax vat made from half an oil 
                          drum cut lengthwise was seen tied between two wooden 
                          poles and carried by two burros. It was designed for 
                          easy transport into a remote niche where a tinaja of 
                          rainwater would support a brief rendering operation. 
                          A grate of hardwood sticks was used to submerge the 
                          weed in this small vat. </p>
                        <h3>Modern Conveniences </h3>
                        <p class="text">Certain categories of things, which we 
                          who are accustomed to a more affluent existence might 
                          expect to find in wax camps, have never been observed 
                          there. Trucks, although used to haul weed to some of 
                          the early factories, are not in evidence. We have never 
                          seen a motor vehicle, or remains of one, in camps along 
                          the river. Devices for marking the passage of time such 
                          as radios, calendars, clocks, and watches have not been 
                          recorded there. Basic tools such as axes, hammers, and 
                          saws are apparently replaced by machetes and hammerstones. 
                          Lighting devices such as flashlights, candles, lanterns, 
                          and lamps have never been seen in the camps; moonlight 
                          and a campfire suffice at night. The convenience of 
                          boats, mattresses, and even gloves cannot be afforded 
                          by the cereros; nor can eye glasses, finger rings, dishes, 
                          and flatware. For those who live standing up and working 
                          or sleeping on the ground, there is no need for chairs 
                          and tables. Common domestic animals such as dogs, cats, 
                          and chickens have not been observed. The sharp eye of 
                          a master wax maker judges the weight of bags of wax 
                          in lieu of scales. Even such inexpensive conveniences 
                          as books, paper, pencils, and soap are apparently beyond 
                          the means of or simply not desired by cereros.</p>
