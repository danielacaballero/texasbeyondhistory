                  <h3><a name="settlements"></a>Historic Settlements </h3>
                  <p class="text">Early Spanish activity in this section of the 
                    Chihuahuan Desert was centered around El Paso del Norte and 
                    La Junta de los R&iacute;os (junction of the Rio Conchos and 
                    Rio Grande), with enduring settlements established at both 
                    locations. Isolated outposts were established at San Carlos 
                    and San Vicente, and modern villages in those areas probably 
                    have been continuously occupied. Two hundred years of Spanish 
                    rule made many contributions to the modern culture of the 
                    Chihuahuan Desert.</p>
                  <p class="text">Throughout much of the 19th century, this area 
                    served as a corridor for Plains Indian raids on settlements 
                    in Mexico, and the &quot;Great Comanche War Trail&quot; is 
                    firmly implanted in the folklore and physiography. A few remaining 
                    Jumano Indians in villages along the river probably were assimilated 
                    into the larger Mexican population. (For more information 
                    on the early history of the region, see the<em> Texas Beyond 
                    History exhibit: <a href="../forts/davis/trails.html" class="text">Trails 
                    of the Trans Pecos</a>.)</em></p>
                  <p class="text">Anglo-American settlement in this area lagged 
                    behind that in other areas of Texas, in part because of its 
                    isolation from the more densely populated eastern half of 
                    the state with its easier access to supplies, in part because 
                    of the Indian raids in the area, and in part because of the 
                    aridity of the land itself. However, by the mid-19th century, 
                    interest was evident. After the Mexican War in 1845-1848, 
                    this region was examined by various topographical engineers. 
                    Perhaps the most important appraisal was that made by William 
                    H. Emory and associates during their survey of the United 
                    States and Mexican boundary in 1852, although the Emory party 
                    failed to traverse the rugged canyons.</p>
                  <p><span class="text">Early Anglo settlement along this segment 
                    of the Rio Grande began in earnest after the Civil War, with 
                    men like Ben Leaton, John Spencer, Milton Faver, and John 
                    Burgess establishing ranches, and in some cases fortifications, 
                    at choice locations. The last of the Apaches, under their 
                    great chief Victorio, were driven from this area by 1880, 
                    and soon thereafter most of the free and easy land had been 
                    incorporated into large ranches. Some successful ranches remain 
                    in the same families today. The State of Texas wisely retained 
                    ownership of many scattered and isolated tracts of land for 
                    benefit of the public school system. Around the turn of the 
                    century, entrepreneurs and small businessmen were moving into 
                    frontier towns like Marfa and Alpine, looking for opportunities 
                    in the undeveloped desert vastness.</span></p>
                  <h3><a name="begin"></a>Commercial Beginnings </h3>
                  <p class="text">When or how candelilla wax first began to be 
                    utilized by historic inhabitants of the area is not recorded. 
                    Use of the wax for candles, religious statues, artificial 
                    flowers, and as waterproofing for leather, cloth, and matches 
                    may go back many generations in the Chihuahuan Desert. Mass 
                    production for commercial purposes seems to have begun in 
                    Mexico in the first decade of the twentieth century. </p>
                  <p class="text">One of the early wax entrepreneurs, Ralph Ogden, 
                    was a Texan who established a factory in Mexico because, as 
                    he said, &quot;that's where the candelilla grows.&quot; Ruth 
                    Ogden Goddard, in recounting her husband's business activities, 
                    says he had a producing wax factory in Santa Elena, interior 
                    Mexico, when she met him in 1910, and he planned to install 
                    another closer to the border. Ogden said he had learned about 
                    the wax from a padre at a &quot;Spanish Mission&quot; who 
                    used it for making candles. While use of the wax for candle 
                    making in Mexico has been reported elsewhere, an informant 
                    on the Texas border claimed he had never seen the wax used 
                    for candles, because it was too valuable to burn. It seems 
                    probable that use of the wax as an ingredient in commercial 
                    products, with its consequent increase in value of the wax, 
                    brought about a decline in local use of items, such as candles, 
                    that were made entirely of candelilla wax. </p>
                  <p class="text">Oscar Pacius, a chemist in Monterrey, Mexico, 
                    is said to have developed the first economical process for 
                    commercial production of wax from candelilla. Pacius was associated 
                    with the Continental Wax Company of Little Rock, Arkansas, 
                    which reportedly had wax factories operating in Mexico by 
                    about 1910, and he later became involved in a wax company 
                    stock scheme in Alpine, Texas, which fizzled without ever 
                    producing wax.<br>
                    <br>
                    By 1919, several factories were reported to be making candelilla 
                    wax in the Monterrey consular district, with the largest of 
                    these producing a daily output of about 662 pounds, which 
                    would involve processing 30,000 pounds of plants. The largest 
                    stands of candelilla plants in this area were in the Montemorelos, 
                    Galeana, Bustamante, and Villadama regions. </p>
                  <p class="text">The beginnings of commercial exploitation of 
                    candelilla in Texas also date from the early 20th century. 
                    In 1907 the Thirtieth Texas Legislature passed S.B. No. 118, 
                    which controlled the harvesting of guayule, lechuguilla, and 
                    other plants on the extensive state school lands in west Texas. 
                    Based on this statute, the General Land Office on July 20, 
                    1907, adopted rules governing harvesting of the plants. The 
                    almost immediate issuance of leases for the gathering of candelilla 
                    indicates that commercial interest in the plant was already 
                    in existence along the border. </p>
                  <h3><a name="rush"></a>The Great Wax Rush </h3>
                  <p class="text">From 1908 until the end of World War I, the 
                    issuance of leases by the state reflects a continuous increase 
                    in wax-making operations in west Texas. And in addition to 
                    the profits to be made from gathering and processing candelilla, 
                    there was apparently money to be made in selling the rights 
                    for harvesting.</p>
                  <p class="text">In May 1908, W.W. Willett petitioned the state 
                    for the rights to gather &quot;Candalilla&quot; in Terrell 
                    and Brewster counties, and the first contract for candelilla 
                    was issued to Willett and G.E. Brashear of Uvalde for a period 
                    of five years for a payment of $1,000. Willett sold his share 
                    of the 1908 contract to M.B. Mayer of San Antonio for $10, 
                    but there is a 1909 cash receipt in the General Land Office 
                    archives from the Willett Candelilla Wax Company, indicating 
                    that Willett was still involved in wax production during that 
                    year. Willett also requested a lease extension in March 1911. 
                    G.B. Fenley of Uvalde purchased from Mayer the share that 
                    had earlier belonged to Willett, and then Fenley and Brashear 
                    renewed the lease for Brewster and Terrell counties in 1911 
                    for a period of five years and a payment of $1,000. They then 
                    sold the new lease to E.D. Lowe of Brewster County for $7,000 
                    in cash and $13,000 in capital stock of the American Wax Company. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The second candelilla contract granted by the 
                    state was issued to J.H. Smith of El Paso in December 1908 
                    for harvesting the plant in El Paso, Presidio, and Jeff Davis 
                    counties, for a period of five years for a payment of $300 
                    per year. (Since Hudspeth County was excluded from this contract, 
                    it may have been under contract to other parties.) In 1912 
                    J.H. Taff tried to renew the original Smith contract on El 
                    Paso, Presidio, and Jeff Davis counties, but it was transferred 
                    in 1913 to G.W. Wooley and the Candelilla Wax Company of Marfa. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Edgar D. Lowe is reported to have secured a 
                    contract from the state in 1911 and installed the first wax 
                    factory in west Texas at Double Mills on Maravillas Creek 
                    in October of that year. W.K. Ellis and C.D. Wood established 
                    successful wax factories at McKinney Springs in 1912 and at 
                    Glenn Springs in 1914. The complexity of the dealings among 
                    these early wax entrepreneurs is reflected in a letter to 
                    the land commissioner from Ellis in November 1915. Other early 
                    schemes for making fortunes from wax abounded, and newspapers 
                    from 1911 to 1915 contain many articles concerning the promise 
                    and disappointments of the candelilla business. </p>
                  <p class="text">Feverish activity in the wax business was stimulated 
                    by the high price of wax immediately preceding and during 
                    World War I, when wax was used extensively for waterproofing 
                    tents and ammunition. The increase in business, of course, 
                    did nothing to lessen the complexity of the entrepreneurs' 
                    dealings. Edward M. Ellis of Memphis, Tennessee (American 
                    Wax Company), secured the candelilla lease for Brewster and 
                    Terrell counties in 1916 for five years for a cash payment 
                    of $1,000. This is the lease that had originally been granted 
                    to Willett and Brashear in 1908, then was owned by Mayer and 
                    Brashear, Fenley and Brashear, and E.D. Lowe in succession. 
                    E.M. Green of San Antonio secured a five-year candelilla lease 
                    on Hudspeth County in 1918 for $250 and sold it the same year 
                    to Salvador Madero of San Antonio for $1,000. The last lease 
                    to be issued by the state during the &quot;great wax rush&quot; 
                    was granted in 1922. </p>

                  <h3><a name="factories"></a>The Early Factories</h3>
                  <p class="text">The wax factory at Glenn Springs was one of 
                    the earliest and largest in the Big Bend region. Established 
                    in 1914 by W.K. Ellis and C.D. Wood, it soon boasted a water 
                    storage system, a boiler room with tall smoke stacks, six 
                    large extracting vats, a well-stocked general store, a large 
                    house for the Anglo foreman, and several dozen huts for families 
                    of the Mexican workers. In May 1916 the factory was thriving 
                    in spite of troubled times and a tense political situation 
                    along the border. General Pershing was with his troops in 
                    Mexico pursuing Pancho Villa, and the two governments were 
                    negotiating in El Paso to try and ease tensions. Several soldiers 
                    were stationed at Glenn Springs to help protect the wax factory 
                    and its little settlement. On the night of May 5, a group 
                    of about 75 Mexican raiders crossed the river and attacked 
                    Glenn Springs, killing several people, including troopers, 
                    and looting the store. Colonel George Langhorne and two troops 
                    of U.S. Cavalry crossed the border on May 11 and pursued the 
                    raiders over 60 miles into Mexico. </p>
                  <p class="text">The cavalry killed and captured several of the 
                    raiders and recovered some of the Glenn Springs loot, and 
                    the border dispute between the two countries became even more 
                    critical. By July 1916 the United States had over 100,000 
                    troops along the Mexican border and 250 men were assigned 
                    to protect the wax factory at Glenn Springs. Although there 
                    were sporadic attacks on ranches in 1918 and 1919, Glenn Springs 
                    had no further visits from Mexican raiders, and the troops 
                    were withdrawn by 1920. </p>
                  <p class="text">In addition to the Ellis and Wood operation 
                    at Glenn Springs, their earlier location at McKinney Springs, 
                    and the Lowe factory established in 1911 at Double Mills, 
                    several other attempts were made along the border to mass 
                    produce candelilla wax in factories. The Fisher factory was 
                    in operation near Lajitas in 1916 and during the boom years 
                    of World War I, H.H. Harris and J.L. Crawford operated a large 
                    candelilla factory in Fresno Canyon. However, at the end of 
                    the war, wax prices dropped sharply, and all of the factories 
                    closed, including the Ellis and Wood plant at Glenn Springs. 
                    Throughout the 1920s production waxed and waned along with 
                    market prices, but some of the factories re-opened and prospered. 
                    W.D. Burcham purchased the Glenn Springs factory and produced 
                    wax there from about 1920 to 1929. Captain Wood continued 
                    to produce some wax at other locations after he sold the Glenn 
                    Springs operation. The Fresno Canyon plant also was back in 
                    production during the 20s and reportedly shipped $100,000 
                    worth of wax in 1923. </p>
                  <p class="text">Although there are some good photographs of 
                    the early factories and some information on owners and volume 
                    of wax produced, little is known about the actual daily operation 
                    of the factories. Generally, a factory consisted of a building 
                    containing a large boiler fired with creosote brush and spent 
                    candelilla and vented by tall smoke stacks. Water was pumped 
                    from springs or windmill tanks, and pipes carried steam to 
                    a series of six or eight boiling vats that were charged with 
                    candelilla plants by means of carts and platforms suspended 
                    by ropes and pulleys.</p>
                  <p class="text"> As many as 50 men worked at one of these factories, 
                    stoking the firebox, charging the vats, skimming wax, drying 
                    spent weed, and gathering the tons of candelilla processed 
                    daily. Trucks, wagons, and burros transported the masses of 
                    weed in from the gathering fields. The largest and most accessible 
                    virgin stands of candelilla went into the early factories, 
                    and big profits went to Anglo investors. For example, it is 
                    estimated that $500,000 worth of wax was marketed from Brewster 
                    County in 1928. The work was done by Mexican laborers who 
                    earned about $1.50 per ton for harvesting the weed by hand. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">None of the wax factories along the border lasted 
                    very long, and now only traces of them remain. The McKinney 
                    Springs and Glenn Springs sites were visited and recorded 
                    in 1980. Much of the metal from the sites was scavenged during 
                    World War II metal drives, and additional damage was done 
                    when the sites were &quot;cleaned up&quot; during the early 
                    years of Big Bend National Park. The Glenn Springs site revealed 
                    evidence of both the early operation and a later one dating 
                    from the late 1930s, including water transport and storage 
                    systems, structure foundations, ruins of wax vat pits, numerous 
                    artifacts, and ruins of the wax makers' houses. This site 
                    is a major cultural resource in the park. </p>
                  <p class="text">Some small factories can still be found operating 
                    in interior Mexico, particularly around Quatro Cienegas and 
                    Saltillo. A few factories were established in west Texas after 
                    the 1920s, but the only persistent production system along 
                    the Rio Grande is the one observed in transient camps. </p>
                  <h3><a name="camps"></a>The Transient Camps </h3>
                  <p class="text">Much wax has been produced along the river in 
                    temporary camps, where a few men with their burros go to good 
                    stands of candelilla and set up one or more small vats above 
                    fire pits dug in the ground. The men camp under primitive 
                    conditions for a few weeks or a few months and then quickly 
                    pull up stakes and move the operation to a more productive 
                    location. By the late 1930s these small and transient camps 
                    along the river had begun to replace factory operations, and 
                    the days of the speculators and stock promoters and quick 
                    profit seekers were largely over. Wax making had simply become 
                    hard, hot, dirty, dreary work. Nevertheless, at least one 
                    flamboyant entrepreneur was to emerge during this period. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Alton Hutson became involved in the candelilla 
                    wax business in the years just before World War II. He helped 
                    finance widespread wax production in northern Mexico and paid 
                    top price for truckloads of wax delivered to the American 
                    side of the international bridge in Laredo. Mexican officials 
                    eventually closed down this operation and accused Hutson of 
                    smuggling 400,000 pounds of wax across the border in Laredo, 
                    but he had declared it all with United States Customs and 
                    therefore had done nothing illegal in this country. Hutson 
                    also leased land in the Big Bend area and established a refining 
                    operation at the old Glenn Springs location, which was in 
                    production in 1939 utilizing Mexican laborers. He claimed 
                    that during his absence Mexican officials arranged to have 
                    his building and candelilla stock burned and the equipment 
                    carried off to Mexico. If true, this constituted the &quot;second&quot; 
                    Glenn Springs raid. </p>
                  <p class="text">Sharply increased demand for fine wax in World 
                    War II caused prices to rise, and a flurry of wax making persisted 
                    into the 1950s. A factory was started by J.E. Casner in Presidio 
                    in about 1942 and operated successfully during the war years, 
                    processing as many as 25 tons of candelilla per day. More 
                    typical of the period than the Hutson and Casner operations 
                    were the small but productive camps of Asa Jones. Located 
                    in the rugged Lower Canyons and Bullis Gap areas, these were 
                    in full operation during the 1940s. J. Harrison, interviewed 
                    in 1977 by Mavis Bryant, recalls:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>Mr. Asa did good at that wax business for 
                      a long time. He put in one [wax camp] on the river down 
                      here below me. He got the candelilla in Mexico&#151;wasn't 
                      much on this side. He got a bulldozer in there and scraped 
                      out an airstrip on top of the hill. Never did anybody think 
                      enough of it to land on it. </em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">Another informant reported that he went into 
                    the candelilla wax business in 1940 and was able to pay off 
                    about $500,000 in debts in three years, using profits from 
                    his wax operations alone. He had as many as 400 people working 
                    with wax during the war years.</p>
                  <p class="text">With the passing of the early factories, the 
                    formality of leasing state lands seems to have been ignored, 
                    and none had been issued since 1922. However, in the late 
                    1940s increased demand for the wax evidently reactivated the 
                    state's interest. </p>
                  <p class="text">One informant said he found some good &quot;weed&quot; 
                    areas between Shafter and Presidio and secured a lease for 
                    gathering candelilla on the state lands. He set up a camp 
                    and began producing cerote (rough wax) but soon had to quit 
                    because of serious arguments with ranchers who had grazing 
                    leases on the same state lands and did not believe he had 
                    a legal right to harvest candelilla on &quot;their&quot; land.</p>
                  <p class="text">One of the most successful stories of the later 
                    period of the candelilla wax industry is that of the Adams 
                    family. Eulice and Elba Adams began making wax on their west 
                    Texas ranch in the late 1930s, and Eulice continued intermittent 
                    production until his death in 1962. At times they had as many 
                    as 150 men making wax on the ranch and produced as much as 
                    25,000 pounds of rough wax per month. Their cerote was sold 
                    to Casner until Eulice's son, David, took over the business 
                    in 1962 and expanded from wax production into refining and 
                    marketing as well. </p>
                  <p class="text">Wax making in small camps along the river has 
                    continued to the present time, but relatively small quantities 
                    have been marketed in Texas in recent years. Wax production 
                    in Texas and along the Rio Grande has always been a small 
                    part of the industry, with perhaps 80 to 90 percent of the 
                    total output coming from the interior Mexican states of Chihuahua, 
                    Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Durango, and Zacatecas. Records are 
                    not available on candelilla wax importation prior to 1936, 
                    but during the years from 1936 to 1952 official importation 
                    of candelilla wax from Mexico ranged from about two million 
                    pounds annually in the late 1930s to as much as ten million 
                    pounds during the World War II years. All of this production 
                    was from wild plants.</p>
                  <h3><a name="prices"></a>Fluctuating Prices </h3>
                  <p class="text">In the 1920s wax usually sold for between 12 
                    and 20 cents per pound. Prices per pound during the 1930s 
                    and 1940s varied from 12 to 70 cents and usually averaged 
                    about one-half the price of carnauba wax. David Adams said 
                    in a 1977 interview with this author that the highest price 
                    his father received for rough wax until 1962 was 59 cents 
                    per pound and that the price of wax remained relatively stable 
                    between 1962 and 1976, fluctuating only between 48 and 52 
                    cents per pound. In the mid-1970s Casner reported that he 
                    usually paid 40 cents for raw wax and had been forced to sell 
                    some refined wax for 63 cents, but he hoped to get 80 cents 
                    per pound in the future. In 1980 candelilla wax reached an 
                    all-time high price of $1.50 per pound because of increased 
                    demand and decreasing competitiveness of petroleum-based waxes.</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>Most of it [wax] comes out of Mexico; however, 
                      there is some produced over here [Texas]. When the price 
                      is good on it, there'll be a lot of wax campers&#151;you 
                      know, up and down the river cooking wax. And when the price 
                      goes down, why then you kinda abandon it and go do something 
                      else. Price gets good again, and they go back and fire up 
                      the boilers and go get some more wax.</em> (Clem Earwood, 
                      interviewed in 1977 by Mavis Bryant.)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">An organization known as the Union de Credito 
                    de Productores de la Cera de Candelilla was formed in Mexico 
                    in 1936 to help improve conditions for the wax makers and 
                    to control prices and exports. In 1937 the Banco Nacional 
                    de Comercio Exterior imposed an export tax on wax and granted 
                    subsidies to producers. From that time to the present, the 
                    Banco and related organizations have controlled wax making 
                    in Mexico and sought to curtail illegal exportation along 
                    the Texas border. Having an alternative outlet in Mexico has 
                    improved the lot of the <em>cereros, </em>or <em>candelilleros 
                    </em> (wax makers). The marketing of candelilla wax produced 
                    along the border was complex and involved many diverse individuals 
                    and organizations.</p>

                  <p class="text">&quot;For the Mexicans it's smuggling, but for 
                    us it's importing.&quot; Wax has always flowed across the 
                    Rio Grande either because buyers on this side would pay more 
                    than the Banco or because cash was more quickly accessible 
                    from Texas buyers. It is illegal under Mexican law to smuggle 
                    wax out of Mexico, but not illegal under United States statutes 
                    to bring it into this country for marketing if it is declared 
                    with customs. Heavily laden burros have brought wax into Texas 
                    at various places, including Stillwell's Crossing, Reagan 
                    Canyon, La Linda, Boquillas, San Vicente, Solis, Santa Elena, 
                    Lajitas, El Mulato, Presidio, and Candel&aacute;ria. It is 
                    estimated that as many as 1700 tons of wax have been smuggled 
                    across the Texas border in some years.</p>
                  <p class="text">One informant described participating in a nocturnal 
                    wax-purchasing session near Big Bend National Park. He and 
                    the purchaser went to a prearranged place and camped. Long 
                    after dark a dry sotol plant flamed up on a hillside about 
                    a mile away, and he was told that the pack train would arrive 
                    soon. Some time later a single individual came warily into 
                    their camp. Upon determining that everything was in order, 
                    the &quot;scout&quot; went out and, accompanied by several 
                    other men, brought in the pack train of burros loaded with 
                    wax. The gunnysacks of wax were unloaded from the burros and 
                    the bargaining began. Various sacks were opened and the quality 
                    of the wax (the amount of trash and sand content) was examined. 
                    The purchaser would occasionally find a rock in a bag and 
                    discard it, but occasionally a rock was added by the seller 
                    before a bag was retied. Eventually a price was agreed upon 
                    and the bags were weighed. The wax makers were paid in cash 
                    and got on their burros and left. The wax was loaded on a 
                    truck and hauled to a refining place some miles away, where 
                    it probably was mixed with wax produced on this side of the 
                    border. Some buyers, however, do declare clandestine wax shipments 
                    to U.S. Customs before refining.</p>
                  <p class="text">One refiner described making a &quot;big wax 
                    deal&quot; in the park many years ago. The Mexican producer 
                    demanded cash in pesos for the load. The buyer was afraid 
                    to carry the cash with him to the rendezvous, so he had about 
                    $20,000 in pesos sewn into a burlap bag and flown to the site 
                    in a light plane. After the large burro pack train was unloaded 
                    and the price agreed on, the plane was signaled to drop the 
                    cash bag. The plane circled twice and the bag was thrown out 
                    a window. Sailing on a brisk wind, the bag landed in a rugged 
                    rocky area, and the buyer spent several uneasy hours helping 
                    some very unhappy wax makers search for the bag of pesos. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Of course, the Banco has long sought to curtail 
                    wax smuggling across the river. It subsidizes cooperatives 
                    and provides acid (a necessary ingredient in wax making) to 
                    the wax makers on a quota system, expecting to get a specified 
                    quantity of wax in return. Wax makers who want to sell in 
                    the United States usually have to get acid from their American 
                    buyers. The Banco also tries to pay higher prices than U.S. 
                    buyers, but it may take one or two months for payment, and 
                    few wax makers want to wait that long for their money. </p>
                  <p class="text">During the mid-1960s, there was a quota of 100 
                    to 150 kilograms (220 to 330 pounds) per year for each family 
                    that made wax, and it was estimated that 20,000 Mexicans subsisted 
                    on wax production. More recently an <em>ejido,</em> or cooperative, 
                    near Ojinaga was reported as having a quota of 800 kilograms 
                    (1764 pounds) per month and as selling the wax for about a 
                    dollar per kilo to the Banco. The cooperative got considerably 
                    less for any wax that was smuggled across the border. One 
                    buyer said at times there were from dozens to hundreds of 
                    Mexican federal officers along the border trying to curtail 
                    the flow of wax. This was especially true from July 1947 to 
                    August 1948 and again between December 1952 and September 
                    1953 when the Mexican government banned all manufacture of 
                    wax from candelilla because the plant had become endangered 
                    from overexploitation. During these years wax shipments reportedly 
                    came from as far as 150 miles to be smuggled across the river.

                    said he has traveled to Mexico many times to locate people 
                    who live by smuggling wax into Texas. He has often bought 
                    as much as 30,000 pounds of Mexican wax at one time, and the 
                    people who transport it make about 10 cents per pound profit 
                    for smuggling the wax across the river. He described the transactions 
                    as follows: </span></p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>They always insist on coming in the middle 
                      of the night, and I've worked all night inspecting shipments 
                      many times. In the bags of cerote you often find what are 
                      called &quot;highballs,&quot; which are balls of wet ashes 
                      covered in wax, and also rocks coated with wax.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">In earlier days smugglers would bring as many 
                    as 100 burros across the river laden with $10,000 to $20,000 
                    worth of wax. One crossing was on the &quot;old Boquillas 
                    trail&quot; below the park. In more recent years wax was brought 
                    to the border in trucks and taken across the river at fords. 
                    The informant said most of his wax originates in a big production 
                    area around Quatro Cienegas, but some is made along the Rio 
                    Grande.</p>
                  <p class="text"> In the late 1970s, it was not uncommon for 
                    buyers to keep $10,000 to $20,000 in cash handy to pay for 
                    wax arriving from Mexico, and, even though the buyers had 
                    guns, they didn't feel the wax smugglers were dangerous because 
                    &quot;they are not bad people.&quot; However, the informant 
                    had heard of shoot-outs between the smugglers and Mexican 
                    officers in which men on both sides were killed. More often, 
                    bribes were paid to appropriate officials in advance. One 
                    buyer is supposed to have made infamous wax deals in the 1950s 
                    that included payment of new gas refrigerators for Mexican 
                    officials. </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>Several times I sold her gas refrigerators 
                      that you couldn't get in Mexico. One time I delivered a 
                      box to her at a place called San Vicente, right on the river&#133;soon 
                      here came a team and a wagon and we unloaded the refrigerator 
                      on that wagon and I asked her, &quot;Where does this go?&quot; 
                      She says, &quot;It goes to a Mexican army captain about 
                      200 miles in the interior of Mexico.&quot; </em>(Interview 
                      with D. D. Thomas by Mavis Bryant, Alpine, 1977.)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">During a visit to the San Vicente area in 1980, 
                    we observed a pickup fording the river with two used refrigerators 
                    in the back. Apparently the system still works. </p>
                  <h3><a name="buyers"></a>The Buyers </h3>
                  <p class="text">In the past, a bag of wax might be brought across 
                    the river at any time, so buyers had to be in convenient locations 
                    with a pocketful of cash. For years buyers were situated at 
                    all the river towns and crossings between Candel&aacute;ria 
                    and Stillwell's Crossing. One of the famous buyers was Maggie 
                    Smith, a Big Bend legend who ran a store near Langford's hot 
                    springs for many years. In <em>Farewell to Texas, </em>W.O. 
                    Douglas presents a colorful account of her business practices:<em> 
                    </em></p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>Maggie Smith's main profit was in the wax 
                      that she bought from Mexicans and resold to American processors... 
                      she bought large quantities, selling them to refiners in 
                      Alpine and Marfa. Occasionally, the Mexican authorities 
                      obtained the help of our customs people in policing the 
                      border. There would be raids, and Maggie, hearing the sound 
                      of approaching officials from the sensitive acoustical position 
                      of her store, would hide any wax in the ladies' restroom&#151;a 
                      place that the border officials, being gentlemen, never 
                      entered. </em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">Two wax buyers for the J.E. Casner operation 
                    were interviewed in 1976. Tom Ornelas had been buying wax 
                    for about 25 years in the Presidio area. He had just delivered 
                    a big load of <em>cerote</em> (unrefined wax) to the refinery 
                    a few weeks before the interview and had a little more wax 
                    on hand at the time. He said the Mexican wax makers &quot;declared&quot; 
                    their wax and delivered it to him in Presidio. They dumped 
                    the wax out of the bags on a floor for the buyer to inspect 
                    its quality. He said, &quot;You must pour it out of the bags 
                    and inspect it in order to not pay 40 cents per pound for 
                    rocks.&quot; The wax makers kept their own burlap bags and 
                    took them back to Mexico for reuse. Ornelas had on hand a 
                    good supply of sulphuric acid to dispense to the wax makers 
                    who needed it for rough wax refining, and he paid cash for 
                    the cerote and rebagged it for shipment to the refinery in 
                    Alpine. When the wax business was doing better he was on the 
                    refinery payroll, but at the time of this report he worked 
                    on a commission. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mrs. Walker, manager of the old General Store 
                    at Candel&aacute;ria, bought all the wax she could get and 
                    was paying 35 cents per pound in cash at the time of her interview 
                    in 1976. In better days she paid as much as 60 cents per pound. 
                    She usually paid for cerote in U.S. currency and tried to 
                    avoid using pesos, although almost all the wax she bought 
                    came from Mexico. She used to get big loads&#151;as much as 
                    500 or 1,000 pounds per shipment&#151;but by the 1970s she 
                    usually got only 30, 40, or 50 pounds at a time. &quot;I can 
                    always tell when there is going to be a wedding or a funeral 
                    across the river, because people start bringing in a half 
                    bag of wax to get some cash.&quot; A half bag of wax, about 
                    50 pounds, would have been worth $17.50 at the 1976 price 
                    of 35 cents per pound, and might have brought twice that amount 
                    at 1980 prices.</p>
                  <p class="text">Walker said most of the wax made in Mexico at 
                    the time of her interview (late 1970s) went to &quot;the bank.&quot; 
                    The Banco paid more per kilo than she could pay per pound, 
                    but people had to wait 30 to 60 days to get their money, so 
                    they brought some to her for quick cash. Most of the wax makers 
                    that she knew worked at other jobs like planting and harvesting 
                    crops and made wax between those other jobs. Wax making is 
                    considered to be good money, and men can make more at it than 
                    at &quot;ranching or working for wages.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">In the old days, Walker said, all her wax was 
                    delivered by burro, but now most comes over in pick-ups. She 
                    provides the wax makers with bottles of acid in return for 
                    the wax. She had delivered about 1,000 pounds of cerote to 
                    the refinery a few weeks before the interview, but at the 
                    time of our visit she had on hand only about 100 pounds.</p>
                  <p class="text">An informant in Presidio said that Guillermo 
                    Galindo, the mayor of Ojinaga, was an active wax buyer in 
                    the San Carlos area for years and became rich in the wax business. 
                    Another well-known buyer was Gustavo Garcia, who lived near 
                    Ruidosa. The informant, who prefers to remain anonymous, also 
                    related a story about a Mr. Kalmore, who owned a store in 
                    downtown Presidio, which indicates that wax buying may at 
                    times be a hazardous occupation: </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>One night, real late, he bought a shipment 
                      of wax and paid cash, but apparently the smugglers wanted 
                      more money from his safe. They cut up his ears but he refused 
                      to open the safe, so they hit him on the head with a pipe 
                      and killed him.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">Ironically, with the high market price in the 
                    late 1970s, some wax was beginning to be carried across the 
                    Rio Grande to Mexico for the first time. A rancher who was 
                    producing a considerable volume of wax reported that some 
                    of the men filched cerote and took it over to Mexico to sell. 
                    He said he would have to be in the wax camp every day to prevent 
                    this type of chicanery.</p>
                  <h3><a name="dealers"></a>Wax Dealers </h3>
                  <p class="text">One of the principal figures of the modern wax 
                    industry in Texas is J.E. Casner of Alpine, Texas, who became 
                    involved with wax in about 1940 and was still refining and 
                    marketing it, at age 88, when he agreed to an extensive interview 
                    in May 1976. Through the years Casner has aggressively pursued 
                    the manufacturing, buying, refining, and marketing of wax 
                    and the attempted massive cultivation and harvesting of candelilla. 
                    His accomplishments gained him the popular title of &quot;Candelilla 
                    Wax King&quot; of west Texas. Casner purchased wax shipments 
                    in Big Bend National Park in the early days and maintained 
                    purchasing agents for years in Lajitas, Presidio, and Candelaria. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1976 Casner said he shipped a large load 
                    of refined wax to a company in London. In earlier years he 
                    shipped wax to the northeast by rail, but it became too expensive, 
                    so he began using trucks to haul the wax (40,000 pounds per 
                    load) to Houston. From there it went by barge to New York 
                    and New Jersey. Following that he sold mostly to a New Jersey 
                    broker and understood that most of his wax is used by Wrigleys 
                    and American Chicle as a principal ingredient in chewing gum. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In our 1976 interview, Casner talked freely 
                    about candelilla, graciously introduced me to some of his 
                    buyers, gave a tour of his refining plant in Alpine, and reluctantly 
                    sold ten pounds of raw and refined wax, at the current market 
                    price, for research purposes. He said he usually pays 40 cents 
                    per pound for cerote in 100-pound burlap bags. He then refines 
                    the wax by boiling it in dilute acid; during the refining 
                    process there is a loss of about 10 to 12 percent of volume 
                    because of moisture and sand removal. He has sold up to one 
                    million pounds of wax in good years, but now (1976) he can 
                    get only small quantities along the border. He blames this 
                    on the Banco in Mexico, a competitor in Marathon, food stamps, 
                    and the minimum wage law. In better times, his wax profits 
                    paid for a new refining plant, building and all, in only three 
                    months. </p>
                  <p class="text">The only other big wax dealer in Texas during 
                    the late 1970s was David Adams of Marathon and Stillwell Crossing. 
                    After taking over the family wax business in 1962, he was 
                    doing fairly well just making wax on his ranch and selling 
                    it to Casner. Then the &quot;markets got sticky&quot; in the 
                    east, Casner stopped buying, and Adams went to New York and 
                    met the wax brokers himself. After returning to the ranch, 
                    he experimented until he learned how to refine cerote into 
                    pure wax. </p>
                  <p class="text">Adams' profits on wax tripled when he started 
                    marketing it himself. In good years he refined as much as 
                    60,000 pounds of wax per month, some of which was coming in 
                    from Mexico, and sold it directly to wax brokers in New York 
                    who handle all types of wax. He also sold wax directly to 
                    the &quot;Beech-nut&quot; chewing gum company for a while. 
                    At the time of his interview in 1977, the wax business was 
                    very slow, with little being produced or &quot;imported&quot; 
                    from Mexico. He blamed this situation on the Mexican government 
                    for controlling the price of wax by manipulating supplies 
                    and dumping expensive wax at cheap prices. He felt that this 
                    was done, at least in part, to crowd him and Casner out of 
                    the business and that it seemed to be working. </p>
                  <p class="text">During a second interview in 1980, Adams was 
                    much more optimistic, and the wax industry was again booming 
                    with the price at $1.50 per pound. He said he could profitably 
                    ship the wax to the northeast by truck in reduced loads of 
                    about 20,000 (rather than 40,000) pounds per load because 
                    of the increased value. The shipping cost was about $2,000 
                    per load. He had produced and bought as much as 80,000 pounds 
                    of wax per month and had probably averaged 60,000 pounds per 
                    month over a three-year period. Although much of this wax 
                    had come out of Mexico, he had been unable to buy as much 
                    imported wax because of the higher prices being paid there. 
                    At the time of the interview, he had about 22 men working 
                    on his ranch cooking candelilla. He said he and Casner have 
                    been the only refiners and marketers of candelilla wax along 
                    the Texas border in the past two decades (1960s and 1970s). 
                    In recent years they have sold from 120,000 to 150,000 pounds 
                    per month, with most of it going to five companies on the 
                    east coast. When asked if a load of wax has ever been hijacked, 
                    he responded, &quot;You can't get rid of a load of candelilla 
                    wax very easily.&quot; However, he added that everyone is 
                    careful to buy, only from people they know, to be sure they 
                    don't purchase hijacked wax. </p>
