                  <p class="text">The Chihuahuan Desert reaches its northern limit 
                    in southern New Mexico, includes all of trans-Pecos Texas 
                    except the Guadalupe Mountains, and extends southward through 
                    the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila in Mexico. This vast 
                    area is not noted for its economic productivity. Of course, 
                    most areas serve very well for ranching, with sheep and goats 
                    being more widely accommodated than cattle and horses. Small 
                    amounts of silver, mercury, fluorspar, coal, sand, gravel, 
                    and petroleum have been laboriously extracted in some sections. 
                    Minor products include furs, honey, ornamental cactus, rope 
                    fiber, rubber from guayule, hunting leases for deer and antelope, 
                    tourism, and a modest amount of garden produce, corn, and 
                    cotton from irrigated plots along the rivers. </p>
                  <p class="text">Perhaps the most interesting and one of the 
                    most economically profitable activities has been the extraction 
                    of wax from the candelilla plant. Since the first decade of 
                    this century, many millions of pounds of this high quality 
                    wax have been removed from wild plants and marketed in dozens 
                    of common products. Much of the wax production has been in 
                    Mexico, but, over the years, varying quantities have been 
                    refined and marketed along the international boundary in Texas. 
                    Many people have subsisted along the Rio Grande by making 
                    wax, and a few have grown rich through marketing. </p>
                  <p class="text">The camps of the candelilla wax makers are one 
                    of the most common types of cultural sites along the Rio Grande. 
                    During an initial archeological reconnaissance through the 
                    canyons in 1964 as part of a thousand-mile survey of the river 
                    known as the &quot;Cactus Cruise,&quot; we began to find and 
                    record abandoned wax camps. Mounds of waste candelilla cascading 
                    over the edge of a silt terrace often indicated site locations, 
                    and these were recorded by means of sketches, notes, and photographs.</p>
                  <p class="text">Along the river there were many stories about 
                    burro trains of wax smuggled across and sold to representatives 
                    of the big floor-wax companies. One day in the depths of a 
                    canyon, a column of smoke led us to a wax camp in full operation, 
                    and the fascinating story of a fugitive industry began to 
                    be revealed. In intervening years numerous camps from different 
                    decades have been recorded and many good people have consented 
                    to interviews. The stories of candelilla wax and evidence 
                    remaining in the camps have become a permanent part of the 
                    heritage of the Chihuahuan Desert. </p>
                  <p class="text">The wax camps are an interesting cultural phenomenon 
                    for many reasons and one that might be studied from varying 
                    points of view. The economic botanist, for example, might 
                    view the wax camps as a specialized industry based on exploitation 
                    of a single desert plant species. Historians see the wax industry 
                    as a significant element in the opening of the last frontier. 
                    The anthropologist and sociologist would find material for 
                    study in the transient nature of the camps and the fact that 
                    they are occupied by males only<strong>*</strong>, who live under primitive 
                    conditions. The folklorist who is fluent in both Spanish and 
                    English would no doubt find the camps a goldmine of information, 
                    ranging from cures and costumes to tales of bandits and heroes 
                    along the river. </p>
                  <p class="text">For the archeologist, the wax camps are doubly 
                    interesting, being an excellent source of cultural data and 
                    insights in their own right and serving also as a veritable 
                    experimental laboratory for generating and testing hypotheses 
                    relating to prehistoric sites in the region, and the whole 
                    is enhanced by the fact that active camps can be compared 
                    to those that have been abandoned for various periods of time.</p>
                  <p class="text">For all those who are concerned with the documentation 
                    and preservation of cultural resources, all aspects of the 
                    wax camps and those who live and work in them are significant. 
                    The era of the candelilla camps may one day come to a close, 
                    and it is important that this fascinating facet of our culture 
                    be documented and studied in detail. We can learn valuable 
                    cultural and environmental lessons by studying the camps. 
                    Perhaps most important of all, from the <em>cereros</em>&#151;the 
                    wax makers&#151;we can learn about hard work, productivity, 
                    adaptation, ingenuity, persistence, pride, endurance, determination, 
                    and survival against great odds.</p>
