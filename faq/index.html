      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="1"></a>Q.</span> <b>Can 
        I visit the archeological sites featured in <i>Texas Beyond History</i>?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> That depends. Most 
        land in Texas (96.7%) is privately owned and therefore so are most archeological 
        sites. You must have the landowner's permission to visit archeological 
        sites on private land. Fortunately, some of the most interesting sites 
        in Texas are on public land and can be visited at certain state and national 
        parks. </p>
      <p class="text">Keep in mind that there really isn't much to see at most 
        archeological sites unless excavations are underway. By joining the TBH partner organization <a href="http://txarch.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#800000">Texas 
        Archeological Society </font></a>or one of the many regional and local 
        societies and associations across the state, such as the TBH partner organization <a href="http://www.staa.org/" target="_blank">Southern Texas Archaeological Association</a>, you too can participate in archeological 
        investigations. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="2"></a>Q.</span> <b>What 
        is an artifact? </b> </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> An artifact is anything 
        modified by human manufacture or use. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="3"></a>Q.</span><b> 
        How do archeologists find archeological sites? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> Archeologists often 
        identify prehistoric archeological sites by finding the chips left from 
        making stone tools like arrow and dart points. Cooking stones and broken 
        pottery are sometimes found, as well as bones from ancient dinners. Historic 
        sites often are marked by broken glass and china, wells, building foundations, 
        and domestic plants. Archeologists systematically walk across areas looking 
        for these artifacts and other signs of archeological sites. There are 
        many other methods for locating archeological sites, including aerial 
        photography, remote sensing, oral history, and archival research. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="4"></a>Q.</span> <b>Where 
        can I go to collect arrowheads and fossils? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> While artifact and 
        fossil collecting is illegal on public lands, it is not unlawful on private 
        property as long as permission is granted by the landowner. It is the 
        responsibility of the collector to know who owns the land, to understand 
        the laws that apply, and to obtain permission to enter private property. 
        We do encourage you to take an active part in preserving Texas' heritage 
        for future generations by adopting a "look but don't touch" approach to 
        appreciating archeology. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="5"></a>Q.</span> <b>What 
        do you learn from artifacts? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> Artifacts have the 
        potential to tell many things about the way people lived in the past. 
        By carefully examining their shape, evidence is collected on their manufacture, 
        age, and uses. Archeologists can also conduct replicative experiments 
        to gain a better understanding of how tools were made and used, or how 
        shelters were built. Physical and chemical tests provide detailed information 
        on the age of organic materials, and the types of residues left on tools.      </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="6"></a>Q.</span> <b>What 
        is the oldest archeological site in Texas? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> There are quite a few 
        sites across the state that have the distinctive remains associated with 
        Clovis people, the earliest well documented archeological culture in North 
        America&#151;about 13,000-13,500 years old (11,000-11,500 B.C.). One of 
        the largest and most important Clovis sites in North America is deep in 
        the heart of Texas, the Gault site near Georgetown (see the <a href="../gault/index.html" class="text">Gault 
        site exhibit</a>). There is also tantalizing evidence that people may 
        have visited Texas several thousand years earlier. One example is at Bonfire 
        Shelter, where humans may have have killed and butchered now-extinct animals 
        including mammoth, horse, and camel about 14,400-15,000 years ago (12,400-13,000 
        B.C.). As explained in the<a href="../bonfire/index.html" class="text"> 
        Bonfire site exhibit</a>, the evidence for human involvement is fairly 
        convincing, but still not certain. The search for definitive evidence 
        of "preClovis" peoples is one of the most exciting and controversial problems 
        in North America. Texas has several candidates, but none that are beyond 
        question. </p>
      <p class="text">The standards of proof for the earliest evidence of humans 
        in the New World (North and South America) are rigorous as well they should 
        be. Many claims of great antiquity have proven to be false upon close 
        scrutiny of the evidence. A good example is the Lewisville site, a site 
        that today lies beneath the waters of Lake Lewisville south of Denton, 
        Texas. There in the 1950s, prior to the damming of the lake, local archeologists 
        from the Dallas Archeological Society uncovered a series of small burned 
        patches thought to be remnants of campfires ("hearths") or possibly natural 
        fires (such as those created by lightning strikes). Associated with these 
        were the bones of numerous animals including some that became extinct 
        at the end of the last ice age (the Pleistocene, which ended about 11,000-12,000 
        years ago). A few stone tools were also found, but only one of these, 
        a Clovis point, was found in direct association with one of the hearths. 
        Radiocarbon assays from charred materials from the hearths indicated an 
        age of greater than 37,000 years ago, much older than other Clovis dates. 
        If the dates were valid, Lewisville would be the earliest definitive human 
        habitation site in North America and archeologists would have to completely 
        revise their understanding of Clovis culture. </p>
      <p class="text">In the late 1950s and early 1960s, controversy raged over 
        Lewisville: was it or was it not the earliest known archeological site 
        in the New World? The local archeologists were accused of salting the 
        site with the Clovis point, an archeological sin of the worst kind. Finally, 
        between 1978-1980, prolonged drought lowered the lake levels and a team 
        led by archeologist Dennis Stanford from the Smithsonian Institution of 
        Washington was able to reexamine the Lewisville site. The local archeologists 
        were vindicated&#151;Lewisville is a legitimate Clovis archeological site, 
        but its original dating was found to be faulty. The problem, it was discovered, 
        was that pieces of lignite (a form of coal that outcrops in the area) 
        apparently had been used as fuel along with firewood by Clovis peoples, 
        giving a falsely old radiocarbon age. For a more complete account, see 
        the Lewisville site article in <a href="http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/view/LL/bbl4.html" target="_blank" class="text"><i>The 
        Handbook of Texas Online</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="7"></a>Q.</span> <b>Did 
        humans and dinosaurs live at the same time in Texas? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> No. Not even close. 
        The last dinosaurs to roam the earth, including the area that became Texas, 
        became extinct about 66 million years ago. The earliest humans may not 
        have arrived in this area of North America until shortly before 13,500 
        years ago (11,500 B.C.). Some scientists think humans probably arrived 
        by 15,000 years ago or maybe even as much as 20,000 years ago. This still 
        leaves quite a gap!</p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="8"></a>Q.</span><b> 
        But what about the human footprints along side dinosaur footprints I heard 
        about? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> If you want to see 
        something bad enough, you will. The alleged human footprints are vague 
        impressions that could be anything. Some of them have been "enhanced" 
        by true believers who wish to disprove evolution. These claims are made 
        by so-called creation "scientists" who reject evolution as just another 
        "theory." There is a mountain of evidence worldwide concerning the dating 
        and evolution of dinosaurs and humans&#151;the two never co-existed except 
        in the funny pages and <i>Jurassic Park</i>. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="9"></a>Q.</span><b> 
        What tribe lived here (or made this)? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> Texas archeologists 
        hear this question all the time and often the answers we give are not 
        very satisfying. We usually don't know and can't know because there were 
        hundreds of different "tribes" who lived in Texas at the time of earliest 
        historic records and there were at least 13,500 years of prehistory during 
        which many more hundreds of distinct groups must have existed. Want a 
        longer and more complete answer? </p>
      <p class="text">The fact is that most archeological sites in Texas formed 
        in prehistoric times, before the arrival of people with writing systems 
        (Spanish and French explorers, soldiers, missionaries, and traders). For 
        the first several hundred years of recorded history, from the arrival 
        of Cabeza de Vaca in 1528 to the mid-1700s or even later, we have comparatively 
        few firsthand accounts and most of these were not written to describe 
        the native inhabitants. Historians have a great deal of trouble in tracing 
        the location of even the well-known groups during this era, much less 
        the movements of hundreds of different groups who identified themselves 
        by a distinctive name in Texas when the first Europeans arrived on the 
        scene. </p>
      <p class="text">The arrival of Europeans in Texas triggered many changes, 
        most of them bad for native peoples. Diseases like smallpox wiped out 
        up to 80% of the Indian population. Horses and guns made it easy for mounted 
        raiders like the Apache and Comanche to dominate the landscape causing 
        many other native groups to flee. Some were taken as slaves, others had 
        little choice but to join up with other refugees. Because of these changes, 
        many of the best known tribes in Texas were relative newcomers. Take the 
        Tonkawa for instance. Long considered the quintessential central Texas 
        tribe, it is now known that the Tonkawa actually arrived in Texas in the 
        early 1700s. This is still long before the families of most "Native Texans" 
        arrived in the Lone Star state, but 99% or more of the Indian things found 
        in central Texas can't possibly be those of the Tonkawa. </p>
      <p class="text">Now think about the 13,500 years of prehistory that we know 
        about in Texas. That is more than 500 human generations of people that 
        lived and died in Texas and adjacent areas. For most of this time the 
        people lived as hunters and gatherers who were highly mobile and moved 
        from place to place during the year. So, any one spot in Texas, especially 
        a good spot with permanent water, was probably visited by hundreds of 
        different groups over the 500 generations. Without written records, we 
        will never be able to answer the "who were they" question for most places.      </p>
      <p class="text">One last complication is that the word "tribe" means different 
        things to different people. Do we mean people who all spoke the same language? 
        People who all spoke the same dialect of a language? People who lived 
        together as one group? People who called themselves by one name? All these 
        things can be different. Take the Caddo "tribe" or, as the Caddo would 
        prefer, the Caddo Nation. In historic times, the Caddo tribe consisted 
        of at least 25 affiliated groups, some of whom spoke different dialects 
        and were sworn enemies of one another. To learn more about the state's 
        earliest peoples, take a look at <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/texans/index.html" target="_blank"><font color="#800000">Prehistoric

      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="10"></a>Q.</span> <b>Does 
        the public have access to artifacts excavated on state property? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> Many of the artifacts 
        recovered from excavations in state parks are on display in the park's 
        interpretive centers. Parks such as Fort McKavett, Fanthorp Inn, Caprock 
        Canyons, Caddoan Mounds, and Seminole Canyon contain many interesting 
        displays. However, some artifacts from archeological and historic sites 
        are considered important because of their unique qualities or scientific 
        value rather than their aesthetic value. Access to these archeological 
        collections is available to researchers. We hasten to add that one of  the main goals of this website is to provide public access to what archeologists have learned from, and found at, investigated sites across the state. </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="11"></a>Q.</span> <b>What 
        are some good books to read on Texas Indians or pioneers?</b> </p>
      <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> There are many excellent historical references and stories 
        about Texas Indians and the pioneers. Here are a few good examples of 
        books on archeology: <i>Caddo Indians: Where We Come From</i>, by Cecile 
        Elkins Carter; <i>A Field Guide to Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians</i>, 
        by Ellen Sue Turner and Thomas R. Hester; <i>Plains Indians, A.D. 500-1500: 
        The Archaeological Past of Historic Groups</i>, edited by Karl H. Schlesier; 
        and <i>Spanish Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768</i>, by William C. Foster. 
        Your local library is certain to have many more books on archeology, and 
        don't forget historical fiction novels. Some of them are well researched 
        and can provide insightful details about the lives of early Texans. </p>
		 <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword"><a name="12"></a>Q.</span> <b>Do all archeological sites have names and numbers?</b> </p>
    <p class="text"><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> Today when an archeological site is formally recorded by a legitimate archeologist, it is always assigned a unique site number, and may or may not have a name.      
    <p class="text"> Most archeologists name the sites they excavate or study in detail. Sites are named for landowners, landscape features, and various other namesakes and the names may not be unique or easy to reference. In Texas alone, for example, there are dozens of sites that have the name "Smith" as part of the site name. But many sites never get named-during a large archeological survey hundreds of sites may be recorded, most of which are never excavated. So to keep track of all the sites archeologists identify, we use individual site numbers. 
    <p class="text">Since the 1950s archeologists in Texas have assigned a unique number to each site they record using a simple and flexible numbering system developed by the Smithsonian Institution that is known as the <strong>Smithsonian Trinomial System</strong>. In brief, each site is assigned a three-part number that gives the site a unique identification number that avoids confusion between site localities. This site number is used on all site records, field notes, and collection bags and is a critical reference. 
    <p class="text">For example, the famous site now under Amistad Reservoir known as <strong>Arenosa Shelter</strong> is formally known as <strong>41VV99</strong>. Texas was the 41st state at the time the Smithsonian Trinomial System was devised. VV stands for Val Verde County. And, Arenosa was the 99th site officially recorded in Val Verde County, Texas. 
    <p class="text">On this website, we prefer to use site names because names are more memorable than numbers. Nonetheless, serious students of archeology who seek further information about a particular site need to know the site number because that is how all the site records and collections are stored at archeological repositories such as the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), publisher of this website. To make cross-referencing easier for the serious readers, we sometimes provide site numbers in parenthesis. Or, in cases where all of the sites being discussed are clearly in Texas, we drop the "41" and give an abbreviated version in parenthesis. For example, <strong>Bonfire Shelter (41VV218)</strong> or <strong>Arenosa Shelter (VV99)</strong>.   </p>

    <p><a name="13"></a><span class="glossaryword">Q.</span> What are the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods?</p>
 <p><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> These broad periods were conceived of originally as "stages" of cultural development thought to be part of a general evolutionary or developmental progression in pre-Columbian North America: </p>
 <blockquote>
   <p><strong>Paleoindian > Archaic > Formative > Classic</strong>.</p>
 </blockquote> 
 <p>This 1950s scheme did not work in Texas and many other areas of North America north of Mexico. In part this is because there were no "Classic" cultures (such as the Maya or Aztec civilizations) and even "Formative" cultures occurred only in some regions such as the American Southwest.  Instead it was realized that the evolution of cultures in much of North America was complicated and not uniform-it did not follow the same neat progression in most areas.</p>
 <p> In Texas, the idea of "stages" was dropped in favor of three major cultural "periods" or "eras," <strong>Paleoindian &gt; Archaic &gt; Late Prehistoric</strong>.  These were and are still thought of as representing a progression through time, but one that did not follow the same path and timing in all areas of the state. </p>
 <p> In the traditional view, the <strong>Paleoindian</strong> period or era is thought to have begun about 13,500 years ago (11,500 B.C.) with the <strong>Clovis</strong> culture, which was followed by <strong>Folsom</strong> and various other early cultures until about 10-11,000 years ago (8,000-9,000 B.C.). Paleoindian cultures are known for their distinctive lanceolate spear points ("Paleo" points) and were characterized by archeologists as <strong>mobile big-game hunters</strong>. Paleoindian peoples traveled hundreds of miles in search of big game such as the mammoth, bison antiquus, and various other now-extinct ice-age mammals. In fact, some have argued that Paleoindians caused the extinction of these animals. This view is contested and humans seem unlikely culprits as the principal cause of ice-age extinctions-global climatic change to warmer and drier conditions was probably much more important.</p>
  <p>Today, there is increasingly stronger, but still controversial, evidence of earlier cultures in North America prior to Clovis. So far, few if any convincing examples of well-documented <strong>Pre-Clovis</strong> sites in Texas are known. We have mounting evidence that the known Paleoindian cultures were more complicated (and interesting) than mere hunters of big game. In fact, Clovis culture is now seen as being broadly based on a variety of game and many plants and not nearly so mobile as earlier archeologists had envisioned. In Late Paleoindian times, these early cultures were succeeded by Archaic cultures across all of North America between about 10,000-11,000 years ago.</p>
 <p> The <strong>Archaic</strong> period or era lasted thousands of years during which prehistoric peoples developed highly localized and successful cultures based on a broad range of <strong>hunting and gathering</strong> (also called <strong>foraging</strong>). Instead of lanceolate projectile points, Archaic peoples made different styles of barbed and stemmed broad-bladed dart points used with the atlatl or spear-thrower. They also used many other kinds of stone, wooden, and bone tools. Instead of being migratory, Archaic peoples lived in increasingly smaller territories because of <strong>population pressure</strong>-more and more people through time meant less and less "open" space.  Hemmed in with more mouths to feed, Archaic peoples learned to exploit any and all local natural resources from rats to roots to bugs. In many areas, <strong>plant foods</strong> were particularly important and this ultimately led, in some regions of North America, to the development of agriculture. </p>
 <p> In Texas the introduction of the bow and arrow around A.D. 600-800 is said to usher in the<strong> Late Prehistoric</strong> period. Some late prehistoric groups learned to make pottery at about the same time, but they maintained a traditional Archaic way of life based on hunting and gathering in much of the southern half of Texas.  In east Texas, far west Texas, and north Texas, many cultures also adopted agriculture and settled down more permanently, living in villages and small towns.  In Texas, the best known example is the <strong>Caddo cultural tradition</strong> in northeast Texas. </p>
 <p> The Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods are really somewhat arbitrary classifications of convenience and habit. In each region, archeologists have subdivided the periods into subperiods (sometimes called phases or intervals) in various ways based on changes in certain artifact styles (mainly projectile points but also pottery and other types of artifacts). The arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century marks the beginning of the <strong>Historic</strong> period and the era of written history.
  <p><a name="14"></a> <span class="glossaryword">Q.</span> What are assemblages and components? </p>
 <p><span class="glossaryword">A.</span> <strong>Assemblages</strong> are groups of artifacts made and left behind at one place on the landscape (a site), ideally by a single group of people or by closely related groups. Ideally, archeologists prefer to study assemblages representing only a single culture dating to a short period of time; these are known as <strong>single-component assemblages</strong>. A <strong>site component</strong> is a group of artifacts and cultural features left during one occupational episode or relatively brief period. Often, however, <strong>site assemblages</strong> contain a mix of artifacts from different times, making it difficult or impossible to know which artifacts belong to the same occupational episode. In other words, we often can't separate the materials that date to different components except in cases of distinctive artifact types considered <strong>diagnostic</strong> of a particular culture or time period. </p>
  
<p><a name="15"></a><span class="glossaryword">Q.</span> What is lithic reduction?</p>
 <p> <span class="glossaryword">A. </span>Lithic reduction (or just reduction) is the process of taking a relatively large, shapeless piece of chert and reducing it into progressively smaller, purposefully shaped pieces that can be used as tools. The general reduction process is called <strong>flint knapping</strong> or just <strong>knapping</strong> (chert knapping just doesn't sound right), but there are several different reduction techniques involving different kinds of flint- knapping tools (such as hammerstones, antler billets, and antler pressure flakers) and different methods of applying force to remove material from the parent mass (called a <strong>core</strong>). Chert nodules can be reduced into a variety of flakes or <strong>blades</strong> (parallel-sided flakes made by a specialized reduction technique), some of which may be further reduced into tools themselves (these are called <strong>flake tools or blade tools</strong>). Alternatively, the nodule of chert can be reduced (chipped away) until only a single bifacial tool is left (a <strong>core tool</strong>).    </p>
