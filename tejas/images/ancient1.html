        Taylor Site (41HS3)<br>
        ca. 1430-1680 AD</p>
      <p class="btext">Height = 10cm<br>
        Mouth Diameter = 13.8 cm</p>
      <p class="btext">The decorations on the vessel were made before the pot 
        was fired. The appliqu&eacute;s were made from clay fillets that were 
        attached while the clay was still malleable. These were applied in the 
        shape of concentric diamonds. The punctations on the neck of the vessel, 
        and the hatches on the appliqu&eacute;s were made with a rigid tool while 
        the pot was still &quot;green.&quot; That is after it was hardened, but 
        before it was fired.</p>
      <p class="btext">This elaborately decorated jar was found in a cemetery 
        at the H. R. Taylor Farm in Harrison County, Texas in the summer of 1931 
        by a University of Texas excavation crew under the direction of archeologist 
        A. T. Jackson. The jar was found with four additional pots and 12 arrow 
        points all tightly clustered together on the north side of Burial A55. 
        Based on the grave offerings and the size of the pit, the excavator thought 
        this was probably the grave of a youth, although no skeletal material 
        was present. The presence of the 12 arrow points, however, could indicate 
        that it may have been an adult male.<br>
