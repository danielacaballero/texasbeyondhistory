        Miss Mattie Gandy Farm Site (41FK4)<br>
        ca. 1430-1600 AD</p>
      <p class="btext">Height = 4.5 cm<br>
        Mouth Diameter = 8 cm</p>
      <p class="btext">This unusual small bowl was adorned while the paste was 
        still wet. The decorations consist of four hollow nodes under the rim. 
        In addition, there are two rows of appliqu&eacute;d &quot;buttons&quot; 
        of clay running in a band around the mouth and covering the nodes. The 
        hollow nodes contain small hard objects, either clay pellets or pebbles, 
        that make a rattling sound when shaken. Bowls of this type were likely 
        used for special ceremonies.</p>
      <p class="btext">Press button to hear the sound made by shaking a rattle 
        bowl. [MK: check out the two wave files in /Created in Clay/Rattling Bowl 
        - the first one is easier to hear, but my rattling was boring. More interesting 
        in second one, but barely audible. Just pick out the best short segment 
        you can.]</p>
      <p class="btext">The Gandy Farm site in Franklin County, Texas was excavated 
        in June 1934 by a crew from the University of Texas under the direction 
        of A. T. Jackson. The rattle pot was recovered from Burial R-1 and was 
        accompanied by 11 additional pots, one celt and four arrow points. Most 
        of the skeletal material was gone and there was no indication as to the 
        sex or age of the deceased.</p>
