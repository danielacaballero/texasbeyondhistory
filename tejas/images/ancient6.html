        Joe Justiss Site (41MX2)<br>
        ca. 1600-1680 AD</p>

      <p class="btext">This elaborately engraved bottle has an unusual form. The 
        rim of the piece is slightly flared. There are four tube-like pieces that 
        hold the two globular sections together. Scroll and spiral line work decorate 
        the top section, while the four tubes and base section have varying engraved 
        line work and cross-hatching. This vessel does not fall within any known 
        ceramic types.</p>
      <p class="btext">The Joe Justiss site is in Morris County, Texas, and was 
        partially excavated from October 11 through October 16, 1930, by a crew 
        from the University of Texas under the direction of A. T. Jackson. Eleven 
        burials were uncovered. The engraved bottle was recovered from Burial 
        5 along with two other ceramic vessels and an arrow point. At the time 
        of excavation, Mr. Jackson noted that the bottle was the only one of it's 
        kind found in Texas although it was very similar to a few rare specimens 
        found in Arkansas. No trace of human bone was found in this burial.</p>
