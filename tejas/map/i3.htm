      <br><p class = "text">Numerous streams and small rivers draining the southern 
        and southwestern flanks of the Ouachitas flow southward and join the Red 
        River including the Little and Kiamichi rivers. Unlike almost all other 
        drainages in the Caddo Homeland, the Kiamichi flows west before turning 
        south to join the Red River. The narrow valley of the Kiamichi River is 
        thought to have been part of natural transportation route between the 
        Red River Caddo and Spiro. From Spiro, it is relatively easy to travel 
        up the small Poteau River, portage a few miles, and then go down the Kiamichi 
        River, winding through the Ouachita Mountains and to the Red River. </p>
