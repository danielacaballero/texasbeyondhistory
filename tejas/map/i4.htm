            is controlled by the dam at Lake Texoma. In times past, Red

        View and Blackland prairies. All of the major Caddo centers lie east of 
        (downstream from) the Cross Timbers, a biogeographical and cultural boundary. 
        Caddo hunting parties ranged well to the west into the prairie-plains 
        in search of deer and bison, particularly after horses became available 
        in the late 1600s. </p>
