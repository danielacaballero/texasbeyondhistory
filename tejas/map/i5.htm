      <p class = "text">The Red River is the central feature of the Caddo Homeland 
        and its largest river, the last (southernmost) major western tributary 
        of the mighty Mississippi. The Caddo occupied about a 250-mile stretch 
        of the Red, from Fannin County, Texas to just below Natchitoches, Louisiana. 
        The Great Bend of the Red River was one of the core areas of Caddo settlement 
        throughout Caddo history. </p>

      <p class="text">In the vicinity of the Great Bend, the Red's wide floodplain 
        is covered with meander scars marking abandoned channels where the river 
        once flowed. These abandoned channels often become oxbow or "cutoff" lakes 
        gradually filling in and becoming swamps. Such features were rich sources 
        of aquatic resources for the Caddo. Because of the wide swings of the 
        river through time, some abandoned channel features lie several miles 
        from the modern channel of the Red River. The wide floodplain of the Red 
        River was ideal for Caddo farmers, offering natural clearings and deep, 
        rich soils in stark contrast with the often-poor upland soils of the adjacent 
        forests. </p>

      <div class ="caption">Battle Mound, the largest earthen mound constructed 
        by the Caddo, is part of one of many Caddo settlements in the Great Bend 
        area. The mound is located within the broad, flat Red River valley near 
        Battle Lake, an oxbow lake that was once the main channel of the Red River.
