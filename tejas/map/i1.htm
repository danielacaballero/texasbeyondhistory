        <p class = "text">The Ouachita Mountains in southwestern Arkansas and 
          southeastern Oklahoma are the most rugged part of the Caddo Homeland. 
          Modest in size, as mountains go, the Ouachitas are ancient features 
          formed of rocks laid down eons ago that have been folded, faulted, and 
          eroded for millions of years. The tallest are 800 meters (2600 feet) 
          high and the greatest topographic relief is no more than 500 meters 
          (1625 feet). The exposed rock formations consist mainly of sandstone, 
          shale, chert, and novaculite. The exposures of softer rocks, sandstone 
          and shale,have been rounded and pounded by the elements. In contrast, 
          novaculite, the famous Arkanas whetstone, is highly resistant to weathering 
          and forms sharp, steep-sided ridges. Parallel sets of east-west ridges 
          are separated by narrow valleys with fast-flowing rivers, that mostly 
          run west to east. </p>

        <p class="text">Certain of the Ouachita rocks were prized by the Caddo 
          and earlier peoples. Novaculite occurs in many color variations and 
          was quarried by prehistoric peoples beginning at least as early as the 
          Middle Archaic period, about 5,000 years ago. Novaculite was fashioned 
          by Caddo flintknappers into a variety of tools including knives and 
          projectile points. The Caddo also sought out crystal quartz from the 
          wide belt of quartz-bearing veins 30-40 miles wide that, like most everything 
          else, runs east-west across the Ouachitas. Quartz was sometimes flaked 
          (chipped), but whole crystals have been found in ceremonial contexts, 
          suggesting that they also had symbolic value. Various other rocks found 
          in the Ouachitas, such as sandstone, shale, and slate, were used by 
          the Caddo for grinding tools, celts (axes), and ritual objects, some 
          of which were traded widely in the Mississippian world. </p>
        <p class="text">The Oauchita Mountains are heavily forested with oak and 
          hickory predominating to the north and east, giving way to oak and pine 
          to the south. Within the mountains and valleys are many smaller ecological 
          niches that support a diverse array of plants and animals, many of which 
          were used by the Caddo. For Caddo farmers the Ouachita Mountains presented 
          a challenging environment. Narrow stream and river valleys provided 
          only limited floodplain areas suitable for farming and, because of the 
          higher elevations, growing seasons were shorter compared to the rest 
          of the Caddo Homeland to the south and west. The Ouachita River valley 
          runs through the central Ouachita Mountains and provides relatively 
          wide floodplains; not surprisingly, the valley was favored by the ancient 
          Caddo for farming and settlement. </p>
