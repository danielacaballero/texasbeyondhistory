      <p class = "text">The Sulphur River and Cypress Creek, both Red River tributaries, 
        were home to major Caddo settlements throughout Caddo history. While both 
        drainages are small in comparison to the Red River, extensive (if often 
        narrow) floodplains and bottomlands occur along their main courses as 
        well as their many branches and smaller tributaries creating varied habitats 
        useful to the Caddo. Upland springs are common, especially within the 
        Cypress Creek watershed, a factor that helps explain the presence of a 
        number of large Caddo settlements in uplands settings in this area. The 
        lower parts of both drainage systems are in the piney woods, while the 
        middle sections are in the oak woodlands; the upper portions extend into 
        the Blackland Prairie. </p>
