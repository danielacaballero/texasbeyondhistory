      <br><p class = "text">The Ozark Highland covers the northeastern periphery of 
        the "Northern Caddoan Area" and is made up of mountainous areas and deeply-incised 
        winding rivers and streams encompassed by the gently rolling Ozark Plateau. 
        A subdivision of the Ozarks, the Boston Mountains, lie just north of the 
        Arkansas Valley, are comparable in height and relief to the Ouachita Mountains, 
        and are covered by oak-hickory forests. To the west it is drier and west 
        and south-facing slopes are dominated by cedar and juniper. The flatter 
        areas of the plateau are covered in oak savanna or prairie, particularly 
        to the west. North of the Boston Mountains is the northeast-flowing White 
        River and its many smaller tributaries, while the streams and small rivers 
        that drain the southern flank of the Boston Mountains flow south and 
        west toward the Arkansas River and its major tributaries. Hardwood forests 
        occur within the narrow valleys. </p>
