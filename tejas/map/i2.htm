        site on Saline Bayou, Clark County, Arkansas. View looking east away from 
        the river toward forested upland areas visible in the distance. Today 
        the valley has been cleared for agriculture. In late prehistoric times, 
        it would have been a patchwork of forest and small fields and openings 
        cleared by the Caddo and probably kept open by burning. Photo courtesy

      <p class = "text">The valleys of the Ouachita and Saline rivers and their 
        tributaries were home to the easternmost Caddo groups. Just south of the 
        mountains, the Ouachita River is joined by various tributaries including 
        the Little Missouri and Caddo rivers as well as by Saline Bayou. As the 
        names Saline Bayou and Saline River suggest, natural salt seeps occur 
        in this area and were the source of salt, a critical nutrient and valued 
        trading commodity. Late Caddo peoples established small-scale salt-making 
        communities such as the Hardman site along Saline Bayou. </p>
