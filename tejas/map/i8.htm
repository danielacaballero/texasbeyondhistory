      <p class = "text">The southwestern part of the Caddo Homeland was home to 
        the Hasinai Caddo groups. This is the only area that is not part of the 
        Red and Mississippi drainage system. The Sabine, Neches, and Angelina 
        rivers are part of the Sabine watershed. The Sabine empties into the Gulf 
        of Mexico almost 300 miles west of the mouth of the Mississippi. The rivers 
        are prone to flooding and have relatively wide floodplains with meander 
        features such as oxbow lakes and terraces of differing ages. Prior to 
        historic land-use practices, the bottomlands were covered in dense hardwood 
        forests and swampy areas. </p>
      <p class = "text">The southwestern Caddo Homeland lies within the southern 
        pine forests (piney woods) of deep east Texas. Upland areas here typically 
        have shallow soils poorly suited for farming. The deeper, more fertile 
        soils along the river floodplains attracted Caddo farmers. Hardwood forests 
        along the rivers also provided habitat for many of the plants and animals 
        upon which the Caddo depended. </p>
