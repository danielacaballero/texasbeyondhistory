<p class="text">The Southern Ozark Highlands remain poorly known.  There are a series of mound centers and smaller settlements extending to the southernmost area of Missouri that are believed to part of the same culture that settled the Arkansas Valley.  Most of the sites are along the river and stream valleys including those that drain directly to the Arkansas River as well as some that are part of the White River drainage. During the periods when Harlan and then Spiro were the dominate centers, there was apparently a three-level hierarchy of settlements within the southern Ozark Highlands.  Rockshelters and caves occur in the Ozark Highlands and some of those in southern Missouri have yielded evidence of early domesticated crops.
