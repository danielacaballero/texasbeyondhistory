<p class="text"> The easternmost area of the Caddo Homeland along the Saline and Ouachita rivers and their tributaries south of the Ouachita Mountains is known as the Middle Ouachita area.  Caddo mound centers and smaller sites occur in the area, but few have been excavated.  The best known pattern is that of Late Caddo saltmaking communities represented by the Hardman site.  Late Caddo groups concentrated salt from natural salt seeps to trade with corn-farming groups along the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers.  In earliest historic times, the Cahinno Caddo were said to be living in the area; however by A.D. 1700 the area appears to be have been abandoned by Caddo peoples.
