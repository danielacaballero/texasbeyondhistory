      <p class = "text">This natural lake (now enlarged by a modern dam) is thought 
        to have formed in the relatively recent past as a raft lake along Cypress 
        Creek not far upstream from its confluence with the Red River. Exactly 
        when the lake formed is unknown, but it probably formed in stages over 
        several hundred years, the final stage coinciding with the Great Raft 
        on the Red River in the early 1800s. The Cadohadacho established their 
        last village in the Caddo Homeland on the upper end of one of the arms 
        of Caddo Lake around 1800. This village is known as Sha'chahdínnih (Timber 
        Hill), a place still of great emotional and spiritual importance to modern 
        Caddos. <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/timberhill/index.html" class="text">Visit 
        the exhibit on Sha'chahdínnih</a> here at <em>Texas Byeond History</em>
