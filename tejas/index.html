      <p class="text"><strong>Four hundred years ago the valleys and tributaries of 
        the Ouachita, Red, Sabine, and Neches rivers in what is today northeast 
        Texas, northwest Louisiana, southwest Arkansas, and southeast Oklahoma 
        were home to an extraordinary society of farmers, warriors, potters, priests, 
        and traders, the ancestors of the people known today as the <em>Caddo</em>.</strong> 
        They were a powerful and populous people linked by language, kinship, 
        and beliefs, but organized into several dozen named groups, each having 
        its own history, territory, and traditions. Collectively, the Caddo-speaking 
        peoples formed a society that early Spanish explorers highly regarded 
        as civilized and friendly in comparison to many of their neighbors. Sadly, 
        this initial respect did not spare the Caddo from the common fate of so 
        many of the native societies who came into contact with European diseases, 
        guns, land dispossesion  and desires. In less than two centuries, the mighty Caddo were reduced 
        to a few hundred refugees who were assigned tiny parcels of land in the 
        Oklahoma Indian Territories, several hundred miles northwest of their homeland. 
      </p>
      <p class="text">Against all odds, the Caddo survived their nineteenth-century 
        low point and today number over 4000. The members of the <strong>Caddo Nation 
        of Oklahoma</strong> do not live on a reservation and many of them do not even 
        live in Oklahoma; they live in houses and apartments in America's cities 
        and rural areas. They are police officers, nurses, lawyers, electricians, 
        artists and more, ordinary Americans with a fascinating heritage stretching 
        back untold thousands of years and far beyond living memory into the ancestral 
        realm of song, ash, and relic. Like many Americans, Caddo peoples strive 
        to maintain and rekindle their cultural traditions amid the harried pace 
        and dizzying changes of modern life. And they wish that more people understood 
        their tribe's proud history and many accomplishments.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong>Tejas</strong> is the Spanish spelling of a Caddo word <em><strong>taysha</strong></em>, 
        which means &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;ally&quot;. In the 17th century 
        the Spanish knew the westernmost Caddo peoples as &quot;the great kingdom 
        of Tejas&quot; and the name lived on to become the name of the 28th state 
        of the United States&#151;<strong>Texas</strong>. </p>
      <p class="text">These interwoven exhibits on the theme <strong>Tejas: The Life 
        and Times of the Caddo Indians</strong> provide an intimate look at the Caddo's 
        long and distinguished history, at ancient and living Caddo tradition, 
        and at the tribe's many contributions to the cultural heritage of Texas, 
        Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. The Tejas exhibits explain who the 
        Caddo are, who they were, where they came from, and what Caddo life was 
        like in different points in time. Archival and modern photographs, artwork, 
        documents, maps, and sound clips augment the written discussions.</p>
      <p class="text">We recommend that you start with the <strong>Caddo Fundamentals 
        </strong>exhibit and then jump to any of the other Tejas exhibits to learn 
        more and see hundreds of images that help tell the history of the Caddo 
        peoples. </p>
      <p class="text">You can follow Caddo history from earliest times to today 
        by starting with the <strong>Caddo Ancestors</strong> exhibit and clicking on <img src="../images/arrowbig-sm.gif" width="112" height="20" align="absmiddle" alt="Follow Caddo History"> 
        icon at the end of each exhibit section and then continue on to the <strong>Caddo 
        Voices </strong>exhibit and do the same. </p>

      <h3>Tejas Sponsors and Contributors </h3>
      <p class="text">Many organizations and individuals have made <em>Tejas: Life 
        and Times of the Caddo </em> possible. The project was launched with grants 
        from the <strong>Texas Council for the Humanities</strong> and the <strong>Houston Endowment</strong>. 
        The <strong>Temple-Inland Foundation</strong> provided additional major funding 
        that sustained the project and enlarged its educational components. Two 
        statewide organizations, the <strong>Texas Archeological Society</strong> and the 
        <strong>Council for Texas Archeologists</strong>, and individual members of those 
        organizations have helped support the project as have other partner organizations 
        including the <strong>Texas Parks and Wildlife Department</strong> and the <strong>Texas 
        Historical Commission</strong>.</p>
      <p class="text">The <strong>Caddo Nation of Oklahoma</strong> deserves special recognition. 
        Its members are the living descendants of generation upon generation of 
        Caddo peoples. The Tejas exhibits were developed in consultation with 
        the Caddo Nation. Tribal members provided photographs, memories, sound 
        clips, and artwork, and encouraged the project in many other ways. </p>
      <p class="text">The Tejas exhibits were written mainly by <strong>Dr. Steve Black</strong>, 
        editor of <em>Texas Beyond History</em>, <strong>Dr. Timothy K. Perttula</strong>, 
        Consulting Archeologist for the Caddo Tribe, and <strong>Cecile Elkins Carter</strong>, 
        historian and Caddo tribal member. <strong>Dr. Dee Ann Story</strong> helped with 
        the writing of the Caddo Ancestors exhibit and provided much-needed advice 
        throughout the exhibit preparation process. <strong>Susan Dial</strong>, Co-Editor of <em>Texas Beyond History</em>, wrote the &quot;World of the Caddo&quot; 
        exhibit.</p>
