                  <p class="text">Caddo history begins with The Old People, &quot;Kee-oh-na-wah'-wah 
                    ha-ee-may'-chee&quot;, who settled in the valley of Red River 
                    and uplands traced by tributaries draining into the river. 
                    In that place, The Old People became strong and prosperous, 
                    increasing in number and occupying greater territory. Descendants 
                    of the Old People say&#151;Caddo people are like the &quot;limbs 
                    and the twigs.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">The first historical documents, written by Spanish 
                    and French explorers in the mid-1500s and late 1600's, describe 
                    individually named communities of Caddo, some quite large 
                    and others mere farmsteads. Interrelated communities were 
                    identified as belonging to one of three geographically separate 
                    branches of the Caddo nation: Cadohadacho along the great 
                    bend in Red River, Natchitoches farther down Red River where 
                    the present Louisiana city of that name stands, and Hasinai, 
                    &quot;Our People,&quot; in east Texas. Over time, &quot;hadacho&quot; 
                    meaning sharp was dropped from Cadohadacho and the people 
                    were simply called Cado or Caddo. Spanish officials heard 
                    about &quot;the great kingdom of Tejas&quot; before introducing 
                    themselves to the Hasinai late in the 17th century. The name 
                    for the State of Texas comes from this Spanish spelling of 
                    a Caddo word &quot;taysha,&quot; that means &quot;friend&quot; 
                    or &quot;ally&quot;. </p>
                  <p class="text">[Prior to 1874, the word Caddo (or Cado) referred 
                    to the Cadohadacho. Depending on context, we use &quot;Caddo&quot; 
                    to mean Cadohadacho and, more generally, to mean all of the 
                    Caddo-speaking peoples. For most references to historical 
                    events prior to the late 1800s, it means Cadohadacho. By the 
                    early 1800s many formerly independent named groups had joined 
                    up with the Cadohadacho and all were often referred to as 
                    the Caddo.]</p>
                  <p class="text">Caddo leaders were skillful in arranging peaceful 
                    alliances with neighboring Indian groups. Their powerful influence 
                    and political astuteness became historically and politically 
                    significant during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
                    when their homeland became a borderland between Louisiana 
                    Territory and Spanish-Mexican Territory called the Province 
                    of Texas. Spanish missionaries, military leaders, and government 
                    officials, French traders and governors, Mexican and American 
                    Presidents and officials vied for their support.</p>
                  <p class="text">From the beginning of relations with Americans 
                    in the early 1800s, Caddos pledged and worked to keep a policy 
                    of peace and friendship with the United States. Exactly nine 
                    years after the signing of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, 
                    Louisiana was admitted as the eighteenth state of the Union. 
                    Dehahuit, the Grand Caddo, a leader whose influence and leadership 
                    extended beyond Caddo, Natchitoches, and Hasinai to allied 
                    tribes, was soon invited to a meeting with the first American 
                    Governor of Louisiana, William C. Claiborne. Saying that he 
                    spoke for the President, Claiborne asked for the continued 
                    friendship of the Caddo people and emphasized that the current 
                    disagreement between the United States and Spain was a dispute 
                    between white people. He urged, &quot;Let the red man keep 
                    quiet, and join neither side.&quot; Dehahuit's cautious response 
                    granted his loyalty but not his lands to the Americans.</p>

                  <p class="text">Mary Inkinish was a child when her family left 
                    Louisiana but her memory of the move remained strong. In 1929, 
                    when she was past 100 years of age and the oldest member of 
                    the Caddo Indian tribe, she recalled things that happened 
                    during and after the 1835 Treaty. She did not speak English. 
                    One of her sons interpreted as she told how the Caddos did not 
                    understand the extent of the land sold, and that the money 
                    was never paid as it should have been. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddos moved to different places at different 
                    times. The first to leave looked for new homes in Texas. Mary 
                    Inkinish was with a smaller group that traveled into Mexico 
                    before rejoining the Caddos in Texas. The last to leave followed 
                    Red River to Washita River in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) 
                    without entering Texas. All were virtually homeless for the 
                    next twenty years. </p>
