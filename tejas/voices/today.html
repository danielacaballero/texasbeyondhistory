                  <p class="text">Traditional Caddo government was preeminent 
                    for centuries before there was a United States of America. 
                    By the turn of the twentieth century, the United States scarcely 
                    considered traditional Caddo government legitimate. Indian 
                    Territory was whittled away and Oklahoma became the 46th State 
                    in 1907. Enveloped by heavy white settlement as well as restrictive 
                    federal law, the chance that Caddo people could survive as 
                    an identifiable Caddo nation was further diminished. Strength 
                    lay in their ability to hold on to distinctive Caddo traditions. 
                    Weakness rested in lack of power to promote an effective relationship 
                    with the government of the United States.</p>
                  <p class="text">Enoch Hoag was one of the last traditional hereditary 
                    leaders recognized by all Caddos. In 1925, he headed a group 
                    of tribal representatives sent to confer with Oklahoma congressman, 
                    Elmer Thomas. They were accompanied by Ross Hume, attorney 
                    for the Caddo tribe. Through his interpreter, Chief Hoag presented 
                    three major concerns. The Congressman treated the group civilly 
                    and gave their concerns token support. His direct advice, 
                    that Congress would only act on Indian Agency recommendations 
                    and the Caddo should properly work though their Agency, underscored 
                    the impotence of traditional Caddo tribal government. </p>

                  <p><em>We have made this trip here for the purpose of seeing 
                    you and holding a conference, according to the matters which 
                    we brought out to you this morning...we have done this with 
                    former Congressmen...now they are both out and you have succeeded 
                    those men...They have appointed me Chief of the Federated 
                    Tribes and I urge that you take hold of this and try to do 
                    what you can...when the people were moved out of the State 
                    of Texas, and located here on the Washita, there was an understanding 
                    that they was to have a piece of land extending from the Canadian 
                    to the Red River, six miles west of the Antelope Hills, from 
                    the 98th to the 100th meridian...</em></p>
                  <p><em>[I] understood that we had at that time an agreement made 
                    with these Indians to this land south of the Washita river 
                    and with the Indians that were still roaming the plains. The 
                    Government intended to round these Indians up, have them to 
                    settle down and stop roaming and the Government promises the 
                    Caddos, Wichitas and Delawares whenever they done that, the 
                    Plains Indians settled down, the Government was to place those 
                    Indians on the land extending from the Washita on south. And 
                    the promise was made to them that they would be paid for this 
                    land....We have mentioned two other former Congressmen, and 
                    have had them handle this to the best of their ability. We 
                    have come today to ask you to take this matter up and do what 
                    you can for us....</em></p>
                  <p><em>The Commissioner informed the former chief, that if they 
                    would consent to take these allotments, and open this country 
                    to settlement, they would see that Congress passed a law to 
                    hold these Indian lands in trust for a period of 25 years...the 
                    Commissioners said this: It will be at that time the young 
                    children will be grown, they will be into manhood and womanhood, 
                    and at the expiration of this period, it will be up to the 
                    young men and women as well as the older class of people, 
                    it will be up to them whether they want to remain under Government 
                    supervision or not...even though we have young men here pretty 
                    well off in education he does not think that that are competent 
                    enough to have their restrictions removed...take me, myself 
                    and several others that has not got an education, they are 
                    the class of people it helps and who need the Government to 
                    look after them. For that reason, he is speaking on behalf 
                    of the tribe to see whether we can get an extension or not....</em></p>
                  <p><em>We all know that we have a Creator above us, that created 
                    us and all things that we see...we have a religion among the 
                    various tribes of Indians in Oklahoma and that religion is 
                    something that we like to maintain. You understand, you no 
                    doubt have heard something about the bills that have been 
                    presented in Congress to try to put a stop to this religion 
                    of our and we sincerely ask you to do what you can to prevent

                    is through the Anadarko Agency; it is the go-between between 
                    you people and Washington. Congress will not consider or pass 
                    any bill that the Indian Bureau is against and the Indian 
                    Bureau will not recommend any legislation unless the Anadarko 
                    Agency recommends it...When the bill is introduced it will 
                    be referred to a committee then at the convenience of those 
                    interested the committee set the bill down for hearing, at 
                    which time you will be advised and you can send your delegation 
                    to Washington and send your attorney who can come and present 
                    such arguments, present your statements, data, and treaties 
                    to the end that the committee be convinced that the bill be

                  <p class="text">Whatever the U.S. government's motives were 
                    for breaking tribally held land into individually held allotments&#151;land 
                    greedy interests (as seems transparent) or humanitarian ideals 
                    (as claimed)&#151;the action was an affront to the inherent 
                    right of Caddo people to live and be governed as they wished. 
                    Tending small gardens for the family and coming together to 
                    plant large fields for the benefit of all was their age-old 
                    way of life. Ancient ceremonies and celebrations gave expression 
                    to their deep-seated spiritual beliefs. Forced moves from 
                    homelands and a harsh environment in Indian Territory interrupted 
                    Caddo self-sufficiency, but the constancy of their traditional 
                    leadership was never doubted by Caddo people. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the twentieth century, though, they were 
                    painfully aware that the United States did not recognize the 
                    Caddo form of government as legitimate. The President, Congress, 
                    Secretary of Interior and lesser Washington officials were 
                    deaf to the voices of Caddo leaders. The time had come for 
                    the old Caddo way of governance to be &quot;thrown away&quot; 
                    and a new way brought about.</p>
                  <p class="text">Two Congressional Acts, the Indian Reorganization 
                    Act (1934) and the follow up Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act (1936) 
                    reversed U.S. policy favoring Indian assimilation. The first 
                    recognized the right of self-determination for Native Americans, 
                    authorized limited self-government under constitutions approved 
                    by the Secretary of the Interior, and allowed the formation 
                    of corporations to manage resources. Oklahoma was exempted 
                    from the Indian Reorganization Act but the Oklahoma Indian 
                    Welfare Act amended the Indian Reorganization Act to provide 
                    for the organization on Indian tribes State of Oklahoma.</p>
                  <p class="text">These federal laws cleared the path that led 
                    the Caddo to organize a new form of government and receive 
                    recognition as a sovereign nation with inherent right to self-government. 
                    On the 17th day of the new year of 1938, surviving adult members 
                    of the old Caddo Nation's three branches&#151;Caddo, Hasinai,Natchitoches&#151;voted 
                    to accept Constitution and By-laws of the Caddo Indian Tribe 
                    of Oklahoma. The vote was 314 for, 38 against. Ten months 
                    later the Secretary of the Interior issued a Charter of incorporation 
                    to the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma. The Charter spelled out the 
                    limits of tribal functions within the federal system as well 
                    as safeguarding Caddo power: &quot;To promote in any way the 
                    general welfare. To advance the standard of living of the 
                    Tribe through development of tribal resources, the acquisition 
                    of new tribal land, the preservation of existing land holdings, 
                    the better utilization of land and the development of a credit 
                    program for the Tribe.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">It was not easy for Caddos to become accustomed 
                    to electing leaders. And it was not easy for those elected 
                    to blend the role of Caddi with that of Chairman, <em>nit-tso-sah-dos-cha-ah</em>, 
                    &quot;one who takes the chair.&quot; The uppermost concern 
                    of a Caddi often centered on cultural tradition. More and 
                    more the responsibilities of Chairman became much like those 
                    of a CEO for any corporate business. By mid-1990, tribal affairs 
                    entailed complicated legal and business matters that required 
                    expertise two hundred years advanced from the knowledge and 
                    experience that made caddis powerful in earlier times. The 
                    original Constitution and By-laws was amended and, in 1976, 
                    revised and rewritten to better serve the best interest of 
                    the Caddo Indian Tribe.</p>
                  <p class="text">LaRue Martin Parker elected Chairman in 1999 
                    and re-elected in 2001, is not the first woman to take responsibility 
                    for directing the welfare of the Caddo Nation. She is, however, 
                    the first to preside over an all female Council who have been 
                    known to call themselves as the &quot;Caddo grandmothers.&quot; 
                    The next major constitutional change came with the adoption 
                    of four amendments in 2002. The organizational name, Caddo 
                    Indian Tribe of Oklahoma was officially changed to The Caddo 
                    Nation of Oklahoma; blood quanta eligibility for membership 
                    was reduced from at least one-eighth to at least one-sixteenth; 
                    the period for terms in office for council members was increased 
                    from two to four years.</p>
                  <p class="text">The old Community House, built on five acres 
                    deeded to the Caddo Indian Tribe of Oklahoma by Fritz Hendrix 
                    and his wife Eva Longhorn Hendrix in 1940, was the center 
                    of activities for many years. Hendrix was a son of Caddo Jake 
                    and a leader of importance during the transition between traditional 
                    leadership and constitutional government. Identified as Chairman 
                    of the Business Committee, he signed the certificate of Corporate 
                    Charter in 1938. The land from his allotment was deeded &quot;in 
                    consideration of the construction and maintenance of community 
                    project.</p>
                  <p class="text">Shaded by large, old, oak trees, next to the 
                    Dance Ground, the Community House is still a center for Caddo 
                    family gatherings and tribal functions. Downhill, the present 
                    Caddo Tribal Complex has grown steadily since the first modern 
                    building was dedicated to the memory of Fritz Hendrix. The 
                    building first housed tribal offices and is now the Senior 
                    Citizens Center. Next door is the Culture Center containing 
                    Historic Preservation offices, a large indoor dance arena. 
                    The Tribal Heritage Museum was more recently built next door. 
                    A much larger building now houses administration offices.</p>
                  <p class="text">The old dance ground on the hill above modern 
                    buildings within the Tribal Complex is vibrant with color 
                    and sound during warm months of the year. There is no set 
                    calendar for these Caddo Dances&#151;they are announced in 
                    the old way. Someone will say, I'm going to give a dance on 
                    such-and-such day, and the people come. Beginning in late 
                    spring, fresh willow branches are cut and laid on top the 
                    arbor frame that outlines the dance circle. The ground inside 
                    the circle is swept clean. Grass surrounding the circle outside 
                    the arbor is cut and cleared of winter debris. The old Murrow 
                    Dance Ground is meticulously groomed for the annual dance 
                    hosted by descendants of Chief Whitebread, his wife, their 
                    daughter Ellen and her husband Ralph Murrow. Many families 
                    camp under arbors, in tents, trailers, or RVs for two or three 
                    nights of dancing.</p>
                  <p class="text">Dancing always begins with the women's Turkey 
                    Dance, Nu ka oshun. It starts in the afternoon, whenever tree 
                    shadows begin to shade the circle. The drum is set in the 
                    middle of the dance circle and the singers beat the rhythm 
                    of the first song, &quot;Come on Turkeys!&quot; Women and 
                    girls hearing the call enter the dance circle from all directions. 
                    Caddo girls are taught from an early age, &quot;You're Caddo, 
                    you are one of us, you need to Turkey Dance.&quot; Turkey 
                    Dance is a celebration&#151;celebration of the survival of 
                    the Caddo Nation.</p>
                  <p class="text">When all are gathered, dancing with steps balanced 
                    on the ball of their feet, a song urges, &quot;Kick, Kick 
                    the dirt!&quot; The songs relate Caddo history&#151;telling 
                    about enemy encounters, victories won, and major events such 
                    as the overnight formation of Caddo Lake. The songs are so 
                    old that no one knows when they were first danced.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are various stories about the origin of the Turkey Dance. 
                    The most commonly told is that a hunter was in the woods when 
                    he heard beautiful songs. Following the sounds he discovered 
                    a group of turkey hens dancing around a gobbler. He watched 
                    long enough to fix the dance in his memory and returned home 
                    to tell all about it. After that, the dance he described was 
                    used with songs composed to record the people's history.</p>
                  <p class="text">Spanish missionaries in the 1700s described 
                    Hasinai women performing a dance to celebrate the return of 
                    warriors. Today, women and girls select a male partner to 
                    welcome into the circle for the final stage of Turkey Dance. 
                    The entire cycle of songs is seldom sung. Some songs have 
                    been discarded over the years. Others have been and may still 
                    be added. Even a shortened version lasts an hour or more, 
                    and it must be finished before sundown. Remember, that's when 
                    turkeys go to roost for the night.</p>
                  <p class="text">The American flag raised on a pole beside the 
                    dance ground is lowered at the end of Turkey Dance. The Flag 
                    Song accompanies the ceremony. Composed at the beginning of 
                    World War II, the words are:</p>
                  <p class="text" align="center"><strong>Wunti shiahtsi ka kin ha nah</strong><br>
                    All the boys that means them</p>
                  <p class="text" align="center"><strong>Kwi ahii sah dawi yasah</strong><br>
                    Where he was over there</p>
                  <p class="text" align="center"><strong>Ki ah huu nit nah da gah</strong><br>
                    He came back now is among them.</p>
                  <p class="text">Pete Whitebead, who served two tours in Viet 
                    Nam and was awarded a Purple Heart medal, gave a dance to 
                    honor Caddo veterans in June of 2003. After the Flag was lowered 
                    that day, he carried it back to its owner, the widow of another 
                    Viet Nam soldier. On Whitebead's request, the Department of 
                    Defense sent special medals made for presentation to honored 
                    veterans later in the evening. </p>
                  <p class="text">Dinner for everyone is served following Turkey 
                    Dance and the lowering of the Flag. Plates are served in the 
                    Community House and carried to seats under the arbor. The 
                    first dance of the evening is the Drum Dance. For Drum Dance, 
                    the drum carried clockwise around the circle in harmony with 
                    earth's rotation. The leaders are men, singers and drummers. 
                    Young boys are encouraged to learn the songs by joining the 
                    lead singers, but they are not allowed to beat the drum. Everyone 
                    else falls in behind. </p>
                  <p class="text">Songs are sung starting from the west side and 
                    between brief stops at the points, north, east, and south. 
                    The songs relate to the beginning of Caddo people on earth; 
                    coming up from the old world of darkness into the new world 
                    of light where they now live. For the last segment, the drum 
                    is carried to the middle of the dance ground and the drummers 
                    rotate in the center while the dancers move around them in 
                    the direction of the earth. </p>
                  <p class="text">Turkey Dance and Drum Dance are the heart of 
                    Caddo culture. Both have significance in the preservation 
                    or language, thought, and the spirit of Caddos past and present. 
                    The dances that follow, Duck Dance, Bear Dance, Swing Dance, 
                    Stirrup Dance and a string of others are light hearted fun. 
                    The songs of one of the last dances, the Bell Dance, are the 
                    most beautiful and may be the oldest. There is no drum, only 
                    the ring of bells in the hand of the leader. Tony Williams 
                    was reared in a traditional Caddo family and honored the ways 
                    of his people for all his life. He was one of the founding 
                    members of the Caddo Culture Club, organized in 1990 to involve 
                    youths in cultural activities and ensure that traditional 
                    song and dance continues to pass from generation to generation.</p>

                    school to learn to speak, read, and write English in the 1890s 
                    were wise to do so. But when sent away to government schools 
                    like Carlisle in Pennsylvania, Hampton Institute in Virginia,  
                    Haskell Institute in Kansas, and Chilloco in eastern Oklahoma, 
                    young students were forbidden to speak Caddo, and punished 
                    if they did. Attending public schools, beginning in the 1930s, 
                    peer pressure and fear of appearing backward or ignorant restrained 
                    the use of Caddo language outside the home. By that time, 
                    too, Caddo was spoken in fewer homes. More parents married 
                    to members of different tribes communicated primarily in English. 
                    Grandparents, who still spoke the language in conversation 
                    with others of their generation or older, spoke it less often 
                    in homes where English had become the every day language. 
                    For young people entering the workplace, speaking Caddo could 
                    actually be a hindrance. So it is in 2003, less than 30 Caddos 
                    are able to speak the native fluently.</p>
                  <p class="text">Buntin Williams a fluent speaker in Caddo and 
                    English, is the one most often called upon for public prayer. 
                    Every Caddo meeting, large or small, every meal, every dance 
                    or other gathering begins with prayer. This has always been 
                    the Caddo way. Buntin Williams knows and practices the old 
                    way as leader of the Caddo Native American Church. Peyote 
                    had a part in sacred Caddo rituals for centuries before the 
                    first Native American Church was organized. There are now 
                    a large number of Caddo converts to Catholic, Protestant, 
                    and Evangelical churches. Others still find all their spiritual 
                    needs fulfilled in Native American Church services.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Ghost Dance was another spiritual outlet 
                    when times were desperate early in the twentieth century. 
                    Ee-cha, the pole, was important to the dance. Carved from 
                    the heart of a cedar tree, it stands about twelve feet tall. 
                    Set in the center of the old dance ground, it was circle by 
                    dancers by the dancers. The songs, most often composed by 
                    a person revived from a trance, were sung as prayers. Prayers 
                    that the world would be better-fruitful and peaceful as it 
                    had been in the past. </p>
                  <p class="text">The old people said: &quot;In the beginning, 
                    the world was still green&#151;that is not yet ripe.&quot; 
                    The world of the nineteenth century did, of course, change. 
                    Time carried it forward, not back. Changes unimaginable in 
                    earlier time have occurred but rooted in ancient Caddo-Hasinai 
                    tradition, the Caddo Nation survives and grows strong. </p>
