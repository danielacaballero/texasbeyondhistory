                    were ceded by treaty between the Caddo and the United States 
                    in 1835. The treaty required the Caddos to leave the boundaries 
                    of the United States within a year. At that time Caddos were 
                    living on the west end of a lake they called T'soto, later 
                    known as Caddo Lake. Their name for the place was Sha'chahd&iacute;inni,

                    (&quot;Our People&quot;). Generation after generation of Caddos 
                    wore major footpaths through the east Texas black land prairie 
                    on their way to hunt, camp, meet and trade. An east-west path 
                    led to favored camp sites in present Tarrant County. A north-south 
                    trail, the Caddo Trace, crossed the northeast corner of what 
                    is now Dallas County. There were no roads. North central Texas 
                    still belonged to Indians when Principal Caddo chief, Tarshar, 
                    led approximately three quarters of the Caddos to the western 
                    fringe of Hasinai traditional hunting ground in 1836.</p>

                    Caddo communities, suffered a great loss of place and population 
                    before 1835. Immigrant Indian bands as well as white people 
                    crowded into the east Texas territory once dominated by Hasinai. 
                    Only Hainai and Nadako, two of the old Hasinai locations, 
                    remained in 1835. Written documents from this time forward 
                    refer to the people of those villages as &quot;Ioni&quot;

                    President of the Republic of Texas, he sent commissioners 
                    to make a treaty with the Hainai and Nadako. A resolution 
                    &quot;that the Senate advise and consent to ratification of 
                    a treaty entered into between T J Rusk and K H Douglass on

                    was submitted to the Texas Senate in October, 1837. The treaty 
                    was lost at some unknown time. Not even a copy can be found 
                    in the great volume of Texas Indian Affairs records, correspondence,

                  <p class="text">Caddos crossing from Louisiana into Texas roused 
                    suspicion and animosity. Texas Declaration of Independence 
                    was only month's old. Many Anglo Americans greedy for free 
                    land in Texas brought anti-Indian sentiments with them. Almost 
                    all were gripped by fear that Caddos from Louisiana intended 
                    to lead massive attacks plotted by Mexicans. Tarshar and other 
                    Caddo chiefs admitted that Mexican agents had been among their 
                    people but denied that the Mexicans were given Caddo loyalty. 
                    Still rumors were rampant. Caddos were accused of instigating 
                    or joining in frontier attacks made by roving groups of plains 
                    Indians. </p>
                  <p class="text">Texans petitioned United States officials to 
                    keep Caddos in Louisiana, at least until the war was over. 
                    General Thomas J. Rusk went a step farther in November 1838. 
                    Riding at the head of seventy men he invaded the United States 
                    to take control of Caddos living well inside Louisiana, about 
                    twelve miles from Shreveport. The Caddos were disarmed, their 
                    meager arsenal deposited with their agent in Shreveport. Rusk 
                    demanded they stay there until the war with Caddos on the 
                    Texas frontier ended. After making this &quot;treaty&quot; 
                    with the Caddos in Shreveport, Rusk joined a campaign against 
                    Caddos on the Trinity River. He found and burned their village 
                    in the Cross Timbers west of the Trinity in January 1839.

                  <p class="text">Texas Rangers, mostly local community volunteers 
                    organized to protect the frontier from Indians, became progressively 
                    diligent in their search for and destruction of Caddo villages. 
                    Accounts of Indian fights are many and various. Told and retold, 
                    some like the &quot;Battle of Village Creek&quot;, have become 
                    part of Texas folklore. The report written by Acting Brigade 
                    Inspector Wlliam N. Porter on June 5, 1841, may be an accurate 
                    account of the running battle that took place May 24, 1841.

                    <br>
                    <em>We soon found two villages, which we found to be deserted-the 
                    Indians at some previous time, had cultivated corn at these 
                    villages. There were some sixty or seventy lodges in these 
                    two villages. They were on the main branch of the Trinity. 
                    . . . General Tarrant deemed it imprudent to burn these villages, 
                    for fear of giving alarm to the Indians. . . but they were, 
                    in a great measure, destroyed with our axes. . . . On the 
                    24th . . . . we found very fresh signs of Indians&#151;The 
                    spies were sent ahead, and returned and reported the Indian 
                    Villages in three miles. We arrived in 3 or 4 hundred miles 
                    yards, and took up a position behind a thicket. . . . the 
                    line was formed, and the word given to charge into the Village 
                    on horseback; and it was taken in an instant, the Indians 
                    scarcely having time to leave their lodges before we were 
                    in the Village; several were shot in attempting to make their 
                    escape. Discovering a larger trail leading down the creek, 
                    and some of the Indians having gone in that direction, a few 
                    men were left at that Village and the rest at full speed took 
                    their course down the creek, upon which the Village was situated.

                    of the houses having fusiles, the men race toward this Village 
                    on foot; but the Indians having heard the firing at the second 
                    Village, had time to take off their Guns and ammunitions, 
                    and commenced occasionally to return our fire. From this time 
                    there was no distinction of Villages, but one continued Village 
                    for the distance of one Mile and a half, only seperated [sic] 
                    by the creek upon which it was situated. </em></p>

                    marched back to the second Village, . . .General chose this

                    aid to Genl. Tarrant, and Capt. Bourland took each ten men 
                    for the purpose of scouring the woods. The parties went different 
                    directions, but formed a junction one mile and a half below 
                    the said Village . . .discovering a very large trail&#151;much

                    what appeared to be a village still more large than any they 
                    had heretofore seen, but just as the head of the two detachments 
                    were on the end of entering the creek, they were fired on 
                    from every direction by an enemy that could not be seen. . 
                    . . In this situation the men did the best they could . . 
                    . making every demonstration, as though they intended to charge 
                    the creek. The Indian yells and firing soon ceased, and both 
                    parties left the ground. It was not the wish of General Tarrant 
                    to take away Prisoners. The women and children, except one, 
                    escaped as they wished, and the men neither asked, gave, or 
                    received any quarter.</em></p>

                  <p class="text">According to Porter, who was there when the 
                    battle was fought, General Edward H. Tarrant organized a company 
                    of 67or 69 volunteers who left Fort Johnson (an small fort 
                    in present Grayson County). Five days later they found two 
                    deserted villages on the western branch of the Trinity River. 
                    After another five days they found the first of four occupied 
                    villages, about two miles or less from another. They charged 
                    the first on horseback and took it easily. The second was 
                    taken just as easily. Indians in the third village, though, 
                    heard the gunfire from the second and fled. The fourth village, 
                    larger than the others, was seen only through the trees. The 
                    Indians there had time to prepare. As Tarrant's men came near, 
                    they were met with gunfire coming from every direction. One 
                    Texan was killed, two wounded. Convinced they were outnumbered, 
                    they picked up their bounty from the first three villages 
                    and headed back to the white settlements. </p>
                  <p class="text">A count of twelve dead Indians was claimed by 
                    the Texans but, because of the great amount of blood seen 
                    on their trails, they thought more were killed or wounded. 
                    Not counting the fourth village seen only through the trees, 
                    Porter reported 225 lodges and about 300 acres of corn in 
                    the villages.</p>
                  <p class="text">When a larger force of Texans returned in July, 
                    they found the villages empty and burned the dwellings. Caddos, 
                    Hainais, and Anadarkos had lived there, along the present 
                    Fort Worth/Arlington boundary. With them were fragmentary 
                    groups of Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, Wacos, and Kickapoos. 
                    Later that summer, Bird's Fort was built near the battle site. 
                    It was occupied for only a few months but remained in use 
                    as a frontier gathering place.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddo chief who led Caddos into Texas, was 
                    killed in early 1840. His name is spelled Tarshar in most 
                    documents of the period, but is given as &quot;Wolf&quot; 
                    in some. Since the Caddo name for wolf is ta'-sha, that is 
                    probably the correct name of the Caddo chief. After Ta'-sha's/Tarshar's 
                    death, Jos&eacute; Maria rose to be the principal leader of 
                    the Caddos, Hainais, and Anadarkos. Esteemed by both white 
                    men and Indians, he gained an almost legendary status during 
                    the turbulent years that followed.</p>

                    of Peace 1843-1846 </h3>
                  <p class="text">The unwavering desire of Caddos, Hainais, and 
                    Anadarkos was to have a peaceful, permanent, place to call 
                    home. Without hesitation, they attended peace councils, signed 
                    treaties, and staunchly kept the terms. Principal chief Jos&eacute; 
                    Maria and Caddo chiefs Bintah, Chowa and Ha-da-bah met with 
                    Commissioners for the Republic of Texas in March 1843. The 
                    meeting was on Tehaucana Creek at a placed used for intertribal 
                    councils long before Americans arrived in Texas. Chiefs and 
                    headmen of the Delaware, Shawnee, and the so called &quot;wild&quot; 
                    tribes, Tawakoni, Waco, Wichita, and Keechi, were also represented 
                    at the Council. The Commissioner appointed by President Sam

                  <p class="text">A Grand Council to conclude a &quot;Treaty of 
                    Peace and Friendship&quot; was scheduled to meet August 10, 
                    1843 at Bird's Fort. President Houston was present on the 
                    set date. He waited a disappointing month for the Comanches 
                    to arrive before going back to the Texas capitol. The Comanches 
                    never came but Commissioners and the chiefs of nine tribes--again 
                    including Caddo, Anadarko, and Hainai, signed a treaty that 
                    incorporated the principals of Houston's peace policy on September 
                    29, 1843. Commissioners were careful <strong>not to include</strong> 
                    recognition of the Indians rights to possess Texas land. The 
                    Treaty at Bird's Fort is a rarity. It is one of the few treaties 
                    ratified by the Republic of Texas Senate.</p>

                  <p class="text">Although chiefs of nine tribes signed the Bird's 
                    Fort Treaty, errant bands continued raiding and stealing horses. 
                    When pursued, they frequently passed through the Anadarko, 
                    Caddo and Hainai villages on trails that led from white settlements 
                    to the villages of different Wichita bands. They were thoroughly 
                    rebuked by Caddo chiefs at a council meeting on the Tawakoni 
                    Creek grounds in 1844.</p>

                    went up into our country last summer, I was told that the 
                    object of his mission was to get all the women and children 
                    in to the council in the fall, and that the whites were then 
                    to fall upon them and kill them. The waggons with the goods 
                    were to stop below and the troops from the United States were 
                    to assist in killing them. At the last Council all of the 
                    Captains said the old men with grey beards would not tell 
                    lies.--My beard is not yet grey: I am a young man, but I speak 
                    truth. For myself I believe that these stories I have heard 
                    are lies. . . .For my own part I am not afraid, but my people 
                    say I am a fool for staying so near the whites, as so soon 
                    as the corn gets fit to eat they intend to raise and kill 
                    them all and that the reason these goods were put here was 
                    to cheat our people out of their hunts to pay for the good 
                    white men they have killed.</em></p>
                  <p class="timelinetext"><em>I have understood also that if we did not 
                    go with the whites and help kill the Waco that the whites 
                    would think we were friends to the Waco, and kill us.--The 
                    Waco say that if we do not move out, away from the whites 
                    they will steal our horses, so you see we are between two 
                    fires. What shall we do? I know that it is the desire of the 
                    whites to make peace with all, but it is impossible. The whites 
                    have done their best to make peace, but the Waco and others 
                    will not be friends. </em></p>
                  <p class="timelinetext"><em>Two nights ago news was brought me that 
                    the Waco had stolen all the horses from 5 of my men, and that 
                    the men had left their families and pursued the Waco, and 
                    I have not heard of them since and do not know whether they 
                    are killed or not. </em></p>
                  <p class="timelinetext"><em>The Waco also stole some horses from some 
                    Lipan a short time since. . . .They have also stolen all the 
                    horses from Bintah's son, and he has followed them. . . .I 
                    come in to see you and give you my talk so that it can be 
                    sent to your Chief as I do not wish to go around like my young 
                    men have done but come straight to the white path, and pursue 
                    it. Our women and children are naturally scary; but myself 
                    and men are not afraid. </em></p>

                    assumed no further responsibility for Indians, and charged 
                    the federal government with the right and duty to defend the 
                    state's frontiers. In other words, the United States had political

                  <p class="text">The Anadarko village was then sixteen miles 
                    west of the present town of Hillsboro. A second Anadarko-Hainai 
                    village was not far off away. Jos&eacute; Maria had formed 
                    friendships with good Texas families all along the Brazos 
                    River and often visited their homes. Another kind of Texan, 
                    a troublemaker with a bad reputation, accused Jos&eacute;'s 
                    people of stealing hogs and threatened him with a gun. He 
                    then tried to raise a force to kill Jos&eacute; Maria's entire 
                    band. White friends told the chief it would be wise to move. 
                    So Anadarkos once more left homes and fields behind, moving 
                    to a place on the Navasota River in Limestone County.</p>
                  <p class="text">It was not their last forced move. Two years 
                    later the Anadarko, Caddo, and Hainai were living in Palo 
                    Pinto County. Surveyors were seen all about and they had learned, 
                    wherever there were men with measuring sticks and chains, 
                    settlers soon followed.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1848, Texas Rangers killed a sixteen-year-old 
                    nephew of Caddo chief Ha-de-bah. They had no excuse for doing 
                    so. They knew the young man. He had supplied their post with 
                    game and gave them no cause to kill him. Jos&eacute; Maria 
                    had a hard time controlling his people's anger but managed 
                    to convince them they should keep the treaty and let the agent 
                    handle justice. Major Neighbors recommended yet another move. 
                    Jos&eacute; Maria again relocated his people. This time farther 
                    northwest near a well known landmark called Comanche peak.</p>
                  <p class="text">A Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs 
                    in 1849 said that Jos&eacute; Maria was the leader of twelve 
                    hundred people. Caddos who had gone to Mexico after leaving 
                    Louisiana had returned during the summer of 1844 and fragments 
                    of some other tribes had joined under Jos&eacute; Maria's 
                    leadership. The report also stated that the Anadarko and Hainai 
                    as well as the Caddo had migrated from Louisiana. Texans in 
                    1849 commonly chose to forget, or did not know, that the Anadarko 
                    and Hainai had lived in northeast Texas for hundreds upon 
                    hundreds of years before Americans arrived. Major Neighbors' 
                    census recorded 1,400 Caddos, Hainai, and Anadarkos with 280 
                    warriors. </p>
                  <p class="text">Forced to abandoned field after field, often 
                    before they could harvest crops, Anadarkos &amp; Hainais living 
                    near Comanche Peak made only enough corn to last about 4 months 
                    in 1853. Caddos near the junction of Clear Fork with Salt 
                    Fork on the Brazos made so little corn it was consumed in 
                    roasting ears. The Caddo Chief was dead. Some of the young 
                    men had taken to whiskey. Game was scarce for all. The treaties 
                    signed in good faith and earnestly kept had failed to relieve 
                    their uncertain lives.</p>
                  <h3>End and Beginning of Homelessness 1854-1859 </h3>
                  <p class="text">Early in 1854, the Texas legislature reacted 
                    to pressure by citizens demanding a protective line between 
                    themselves and the Indians. An act providing for Indian reserves 
                    gave the federal government authority to select twelve leagues 
                    of land for the reservations. A line of military posts was 
                    intended to separate Indian range from white settlements. 
                    Captain Randolph B. Marcy and Major Neighbors were appointed 
                    to locate and survey lands. They called the chiefs together 
                    for a council.</p>
                  <p class="text">Jos&eacute; Maria was now sixty years old. He 
                    had attended too many councils with too many white men to 
                    have faith that this one would have truer meaning than the 
                    others. In this council his words reflected many crushed hopes.</p>

                  reserve of 37,152 acres, for the Anadarko, Caddo, Waco, Kichai, 
                  Delaware, Twakoni, and Tonkowa, was commonly called the Brazos 
                  Reserve. It was situated on the main branch of the Brazos a 
                  few miles below Fort Belknap in present Young County. A separate 
                  reservation for Comanches was called the Upper Reserve.  
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddo, Hainai and Anadarko gathered in March 
                    1855, eager to break the tough prairie grass sod and plant 
                    fields in ground they could call their own. It was a dry spring&#151;no 
                    rain for nine months. Four hundred acres were planted but 
                    the seeds, dropped late in dry earth, did not yield enough 
                    to make the effort worth while. Two-hundred-five Anadarkos 
                    (Hainai were counted with the Anadarkos) and 188 Caddos settled 
                    in villages next to dried-up fields.<br>
                    <br>
                    Drought and grasshoppers spoiled the next two crops as well. 
                    But the following year forecast a good life in villages with 
                    traditional grass houses, neat cabins, and gardens full of 
                    vegetables and melons. The chiefs and the agents worked together 
                    to organize law and order. A government farmer lived at the 
                    agency in the middle of the reserve and worked with the people 
                    to develop their fields and stock. A resident blacksmith took 
                    care of tools and weapons.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The Caddos built seven good log houses and 
                    had 130 acres in corn, 20 in wheat in 1857. The Anadarkos 
                    built ten log houses and had 115 acres of corn and 20 acres 
                    of wheat. Particular attention was given to raising stock 
                    and the number of horses, cattle and hogs steadily increased. 
                    The women milked and made butter. There were few deaths and, 
                    for the first time in many years, children were thriving. 
                    Finally, in 1858, a schoolhouse was built and the teacher 
                    soon had sixty pupils.<br>
                    <br>
                    Outside the Reserve, the landscape was changing. When Neighbors 
                    and Marcy surveyed boundaries for the reserves, a wide stretch 
                    of mesquite-dotted country lay between Texas settlers and 
                    the Indians. But in less than three years, while the Caddos, 
                    Anadarkos, and Hainais built and planted, a boom of new settlers 
                    came to Fort Belknap and Young County. Complaints that the 
                    federal government provided too little protection rose with 
                    the increasing white population. Hostile Indians, mostly from 
                    north of Red River, raided Texas settlements. They made an 
                    easily followed trail to the Brazos Reserve and then scattered 
                    so that no trail was visible above.</p>
                  <p class="text">Small groups of self-appointed protectors ready 
                    to believe the worst about any Indian, concluded that all 
                    their troubles were caused by reserve Indians. A leading troublemaker 
                    was John R. Baylor who had been dismissed as the first agent 
                    for the Comanches on the Upper Reserve. His inflammatory remarks 
                    in public letters and mass meetings of citizens excited prejudices 
                    and roused emotions.</p>
                  <p class="text">The year the schoolhouse was built on the Brazos 
                    Reserve, Texas Governor H. R. Runnels authorized J. S. Ford 
                    to organize a hundred Texas Rangers. Ford brought his Rangers 
                    to the Reserve to enlisted the tribes' help in a war against 
                    the Comanches across Red River. The chief's called in to council 
                    willingly agreed to send about one hundred warriors. They, 
                    too, had suffered the loss of great numbers of livestock to 
                    raiders from across the River and had been subjected to unjust 
                    blame for depredations those Indians had committed upon white 
                    settlers.</p>
                  <p class="text">Ford directed an attack on Comanches camped 
                    near the Canadian River on May 12. A running battle covering 
                    over six miles began about seven in the morning and lasted 
                    until Ford declared a victory about two in the afternoon. 
                    He gave the Indian captains his highest praise saying, &quot;They 
                    behaved under fire in a gallant and soldier-like manner and 
                    I think they have fully vindicated their right to be recognized 
                    as Texas Rangers of the old stamp.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">That fall, 1858, 125 Anadarko, Caddo, and other 
                    Brazos reserve warriors again cooperated in successful campaign 
                    against the northern Comanches. This time they rode in support 
                    of 400 U.S. cavalry led by Major Earl Van Dorn. The Major 
                    asked them to accompany him again on his spring campaign. 
                    They planned to do so, but for now their horses needed rest 
                    and fattening.</p>
                  <p class="text">Agent Ross gave Tom, a Choctaw married to an 
                    Anadarko woman, permission to take his wife, some of his grandchildren, 
                    and other family connections a few miles below the reserve 
                    where there was good grass for grazing. All together there 
                    were twenty-seven people in the party&#151;eight men, eight 
                    women, and eleven children. They set up five camps above Golconda, 
                    in Palo Pinto county. Late fall eased into an early winter 
                    and hunting season. Several white men came to ask Tom's family 
                    to go with them on a bear hunt. The family agreed and moved 
                    camp to the edge of a small creek about 15 miles below the 
                    reservation. Near daylight, before anyone was awake, gunshots 
                    pierced their tents. Choctaw Tom's wife, another Anadarko 
                    woman, three Anadarko men, a Caddo man and Caddo woman were 
                    killed. Six died instantly on the beds where they slept; the 
                    seventh was able to reach his gun and crawl through the tent 
                    flap before he died. Jos&eacute; Maria's nephew, Little John 
                    who had served with Van Dorn, was one of the young men killed. 
                    A thumb was shot off the hand of Tom's daughter. Another woman 
                    and three men had severe wounds. Eight children were injured, 
                    three seriously. The name's of the men who participated in 
                    the massacre were known. They made no secret of their identities.</p>
                  <p class="text">People who lived near the camp left their homes. 
                    Agent Ross was away so it was left to J. J. Strum, the government 
                    farmer for the Brazos Reserve, to explain that the settlers 
                    were afraid of blame and retaliation. Jos&eacute; Maria and 
                    the Caddo chief, Tinah, said tell them &quot;We are not wild 
                    Indians and will not harm the innocent.&quot; They said Strum 
                    should send someone to tell those settlers, most of whom were 
                    friends, to return to their homes and take care of their farms. 
                    The Caddo and Anadarko did not blame them&#151;they had been 
                    told that the men who killed members of their families would 
                    be caught and punished according to the white man's law, and 
                    that was the way it should be.</p>
                  <p class="text">That is not the way it was. There were no arrests. 
                    At an official examination of the murders that took place 
                    in Waco, the grand jury described the Brazos reserve as a 
                    nuisance. Stating that the Indians there were doing all the 
                    mischief they concluded, &quot;It is now the prevailing sentiment 
                    that we must abandon our homes and take up arms against the 
                    reserved Indians.&quot; Instead of charging the admitted murderers, 
                    the jury found Jos&eacute; Maria guilty of stealing a mule. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Near the end of February, Comanches stole 80 
                    horses from the Caddo&#151;about the last of some five hundred 
                    head they and the Anadarko had three months earlier. In May 
                    a Caddo Indian named Fox, was brutally killed while carrying 
                    a official dispatches from Agent S.A. Blain at Fort Arbuckle 
                    in Indian Territory to Agent Ross at the Brazos Reserve. Agents 
                    were accustomed to expressing dispatches between reservations 
                    by reliable members. They had known Fox since boyhood, he 
                    had done good service in Ford's and Major Van Dorn's fights. 
                    An army officer accompanied by a party of Indians from the 
                    reservation went to Jacksboro in search the men who murdered 
                    Fox. This incident was used by John R. Baylor to spark an 
                    attack on the reserve.</p>
                  <p class="text">On the morning of May 23, 1859, Baylor led a 
                    force of two hundred fifty men onto the Brazos Reserve. An 
                    infantry company from Fort Belknap reinforced a guard that 
                    had been posted at the agency. Baylor and his company drew 
                    their mounts up in a single line within 600 yards of the agency. 
                    He told the officer sent to meet him that he had come to fight 
                    Indians, not whites, but if the troops fired on his men, they 
                    would fight back. The Captain in command said his orders were 
                    to protect the Indians on this reserve from the attacks of 
                    armed bands of citizens and he would do so to the best of 
                    his ability. Baylor backed off and set up camp outside the 
                    border of the Reserve. At the same time he declared that the 
                    warning did not alter his determination to destroy the Indians.</p>
                  <p class="text">Neighbors urged the Office of Indian Affairs 
                    to authorize immediate removal of the tribes to a temporary 
                    location north of the Red River at Fort Arbuckle. Instructions 
                    were finally written on June 11&#151;pack up and move.</p>
                  <h3>The Removal </h3>
                  <p class="text">The thermometer reading on the Brazos Reserve 
                    for the past month had averaged 106 degrees from midmorning 
                    until five in the evening. The gauge was no different on the 
                    first day of August when the families of the Caddo, Anadarko, 
                    Hainai and associated bands left their houses, gardens, almost 
                    all their stock and all possessions they could not carry. 
                    The whereabouts of Baylor and his mob was not known, but it 
                    was possible that they would try to carry out their threat 
                    to kill all the Indians as soon as they were off the Brazos 
                    Reserve. Two companies of cavalry and one of infantry provided 
                    a protective escort. Wagons carried military provisions for 
                    five months. The very old and infirm rode, the very young 
                    and small were carried, most walked the arid two hundred mile 
                    trail that ended on the bank of the Washita River near present 
                    Anadarko.</p>

                    bands of Caddos at the point of&#151;course of the Red River. 
                    He said they were called Kahadoches&#151;they were up around 
                    in there, a large group of them. Several villages, but it 
                    see like he said towns, I do not know the exact words in Caddo, 
                    but he said there were some Hanai groups, and then along the 
                    Sabine River . . . . there were bands living along the Angelina 
                    River and Colorado River and some at the point of Sabine around 
                    in that area and along the limestone caves and around Santa 
                    Marcus. . .And that was told him by Grandmother. . .He said 
                    all the bands including a few of the tribes that were with 
                    the Caddos . . . were brought to Washita Valley . . . and 
                    he said there was others also from the east that had to come 
                    later. . .I mean now eastern Oklahoma and in that vicinity&#151;Choctaw 
                    country. The Whitebead family and some others&#151;The Nedarkos 
                    </em><strong>[Nadacos, Anadarkos]</strong><em> were not living below Belknap 
                    before that time. They were living in east Texas somewhere 
                    or Louisiana. . . that was their beloved home and when they 
                    [Caddos] made this treaty and they wanted them to move on, 
                    that they were paid and later on they moved away from there 
                    to west from there towards the Angelina River with other tribes 
                    that were already there of their people. . .I do not know how 
                    the map is. Anyway it's close to this Angelina River. . .all 
                    I remember of the ones he named was mainly his own people 
                    and the Nadaco and there was the Iona </em><strong>[Hainai]</strong><em> 
                    Band which was similar to the Nadaco . . . it seems that the 
                    white people in East Texas wanted the fertile land down there 
                    and they wanted them removed so when they were removed and 
                    given certain tract of land there [the Brazos Reserve] for 
                    their permanent establishment but it seems later on in a few 
                    years, at least four years, they had this trouble with Baylor 
                    and his men. . . . he did not remember anything because he 
                    was a small baby when they moved there [Oklahoma]. . . the 
                    soldiers brought them and they kept the old folks, old ladies 
                    and small children in a wagon. I did not pay attention to haw 
                    many they had. My Grandmother, she walked all the way and 
                    her sisters, and her daughter, my oldest aunt, took turns
