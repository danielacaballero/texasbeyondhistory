                  <p class="text">For twenty years following the 1835 Treaty ceding 
                    Caddo lands in Louisiana to the United States, the people 
                    of the ancient Caddo Nation were without a safe place to call 
                    home. In 1855, the State of Texas permitted the United States 
                    government to open an Indian reservation on the Brazos River 
                    in present Young County. The Caddo, Anadarko, and Hainai in 
                    Texas, along with fragments of Wichita and Delaware tribes, 
                    moved there, believing they would have a safe, permanent home. 
                    That prospect was shattered late in 1859. Caddos had good 
                    friends among established frontier settlers who knew them 
                    well, but another group of Texans had an avowed intent to 
                    destroy the Brazos Reserve and exterminate all Indians. State 
                    authorities failed to give support against their violent activities. 
                    Major Robert Neighbors, Special Agent for Texas Indians, acknowledged 
                    the impossibility of protecting the Reserve Indians without 
                    armed conflict between U.S. troops and a mob of three to four 
                    hundred lawless men. He urged the U. S. Commissioner of Indian 
                    Affairs to authorize a removal to the safety of Indian Territory. 
                    The Commissioner approved the exodus from Texas but thought 
                    it was first necessary to build a military post in the district 
                    to be occupied. Before that could be accomplished, the situation 
                    on the Brazos reached crisis and the order was issued for 
                    immediate removal.</p>

                    journey. They had traveled 170 miles since leaving their reservation 
                    homes in Texas on the first day of August. There had been 
                    one birth and one death along the way. The escort of federal 
                    troops that protected them from attack by Texans below Red 
                    River and bands of angry Comanche and Kiowa Indians roaming

                    the Caddo, Anadarko, and Hainai families to a part of Indian 
                    Territory known as the Leased District. The area acquired 
                    the designation in 1855 when the Choctaw-Chickasaw Nations 
                    leased that part of their assigned lands to the United States 
                    for the purpose of providing a home for the Wichita and &quot;such 
                    other tribes of Indians as the Government may desire to locate 
                    therein&quot;. S. A. Blain, previously appointed U. S. Agent 
                    for the Wichita, unexpectedly had the Caddos, Anadarkos, and 
                    Hainai added to his Wichita Agency. Historical confusion would 
                    have been avoided if it had been properly designated as the 
                    Wichita-Caddo Agency.</p>
                  <p class="text">Major Neighbors turned his census over to Blain&#151;462 
                    Caddos, Anadakos, and Hainais. Not counted were those who 
                    fled the Brazos Agency after attacks by Texans in 1857. Neighbors 
                    also gave Blain an inventory of property left behind on the 
                    Brazos Reserve. The inventory included 76 grass and log houses 
                    valued at $3545. The self-proclaimed protectors of Texas ranging 
                    the perimeter of the Reserve had made it too dangerous for 
                    Caddos to gather all their livestock. He fully expected that 
                    Indian owners would be reimbursed for their forfeited property 
                    and stock.</p>

                    country near the mouth of the Kiamichi River. It was no longer 
                    Caddo country when they arrived. It was Choctaw country, part 
                    of the Indian Territory assigned to the Choctaw Nation by 
                    treaty with the United States in 1830. The arrival of the 
                    Caddos was tolerated but resented by Choctaws. Traveling on 
                    west, the Whitebeads came to Fort Washita, stayed a while, 
                    then went on up the Washita River to settle on Wildhorse Creek. 
                    They were living eighteen miles below Fort Arbuckle when Neighbors 
                    escorted headmen from Texas to the council held there. The 
                    present Oklahoma town of Whitebead west of Pauls Valley is 
                    the approximate site their former community.</p>
                  <p class="text">The council at Fort Arbuckle convened June 30, 
                    1859. Superintendent Elias Rector had just returned from an 
                    exploration to locate sites for the new agency, a military 
                    post, and tracts of land suitable for settlement by the Caddos 
                    being moved from Texas, the Whitebead Caddos, and the Wichitas. 
                    Fear of Comanche attack had caused the Wichitas to take refuge 
                    near Fort Arbuckle in October 1858.</p>
                  <p class="text">Rector and Neighbors &quot;fully conferred&quot; 
                    before opening the council. Then, speaking to the gathered 
                    chiefs and headmen, they expressed regret for the hasty removal 
                    from Texas, assured payment for all losses incurred, and pledged 
                    that after removal they and their children would live in a

                    recorded in government reports, no formal document was written 
                    and signed. It was many years before a permanent boundary

                    affiliated tribes was officially defined.</p>

                    town with that name. Assured of protection from marauding 
                    Kiowas and Comanches, the Caddos, Anadarko, and Hainai selected

                  <p class="text">Neither the weather nor events forecast prosperous 
                    settlement during the first year. The thermometer reading 
                    at Fort Cobb fell to 5 degrees below freezing in February  
                    and rose to 115 degrees in August. No crop could be raised 
                    for the first winter. Deer, turkey, and a great number of 
                    buffalo ranged the area but hunting was hampered by a shortage 
                    of horses and weapons. Starvation was staved off by government 
                    rations. Raiding Kiowas and Comanches and recurring reports 
                    of threats and invasion by Texas frontiersmen kept the Agency 
                    tribes in an anxious state.</p>
                  <p class="text">Despite such difficulties, Caddos managed to 
                    build 23 &quot;picket houses&quot; covered in grass, 18 log

                    and all faced the east. The log cabins were very much like 
                    a white person's with doors on any side, but always one in 
                    the east and west. The grass house differs from the Wichita's' 
                    by having a door in both the east and west, while theirs have 
                    only the one in the east and their houses were round. The 
                    Caddos also had openings rather high up on the north and south 
                    for air. The bark house was not really made of bark but it 
                    was roofed with bark. The walls were made of split logs stood 
                    on end and plastered with clay and cattail reeds. These reeds 
                    were ground to a pulp and mixed with the clay. On the top 
                    of the house there was a frame made of slippery elm and on 
                    this the bark was fastened. The bark had to be well seasoned. 
                    It had to be kept flat while seasoning so it wouldn't warp. 
                    It usually took several months for the bark to season. These

                  <h3>The Civil War Years 1861-1867 </h3>
                  <p class="text">Peace, however, was not to be cultivated. The 
                    Civil War intervened. Union troops at Forts Washita, Arbuckle 
                    and Cobb were ordered to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on April 
                    17, 1861.Confederate troops from Texas established headquarters 
                    at the Agency near Fort Cobb. Still fresh memories of maltreatment 
                    by Texas troops compelled most Caddos, Anadarkos, and Hainais 
                    to seek refuge in Union controlled Kansas. Some sought safety 
                    as far away as Colorado. Smaller numbers went to live with 
                    the Seminoles in Indian Territory or to Whitebead Hill among 
                    the Chickasaws. A few could not let go of the place where 
                    it was promised, &quot;<em>they would remain, they and their 
                    children, as long as the waters should run</em>&quot;. They 
                    signed a Confederate agreement that promised protection, food 
                    and supplies, and continued residence on their assigned lands 
                    in Indian Territory. </p>
                  <p class="text">Caddo George Washington, leader of the Whitebead 
                    Caddos, Caddo George Washington served as Captain of the Indian 
                    spies the Confederates mustered to protect the Agency. Near 
                    the end of the War, when Confederate military authorities 
                    organized a Reserve Squadron of Cavalry to protect frontier 
                    Chickasaw settlements from marauding Comanches, he held the 
                    rank of major in command of two-companies designated as the 
                    Caddo Frontier Guard. The venerable Anadarko Chief Jose Maria, 
                    who honorably struggled to maintain peace during the turbulent 
                    years in Texas, is described as a sub-chief and Captain of 
                    the Caddo Frontier Guard. Caddos say he died before the Civil 
                    war. No matter who, Caddos soon recognized that the Confederate 
                    government could not or would not meet its obligations. </p>
                  <p class="text">Five years of hunger, severe weather exposure, 
                    and disease took their toll before those who followed the 
                    federal troops into Kansas were escorted back to their Indian 
                    Territory home in 1867. They returned to find houses ruined, 
                    fields destroyed, and great portions of their land assigned 
                    to other, less peaceful, tribes. Though destitute and physically 
                    weakened, they set to work rebuilding the Caddo Nation.</p>
