      <h2>Frequently asked Questions Regarding the Caddo Indian Nation </h2>
      <p><strong>Who is a Caddo?</strong><br>
        A Caddo person is defined by the Constitution and By-laws of the Caddo 
        Nation under Article III - TRIBAL MEMBERSHIP </p>
      <p>Section 1. All persons of the Caddo Indian blood who received an allotment 
        of land as members of the Caddo Indian Tribe are declared full blood (4/4) 
        members of the tribe for the purpose of computing eligibility of their 
        descendants for membership.</p>
      <p>Section 2. All living lineal descendants of allottees eligible for membership 
        under the provisions of Section 1 of this Article born on or before the 
        date of adoption of this Constitution. </p>
      <p>Section 3. (a) All persons of at least one-sixteenth (1/16) degree Caddo 
        Indian Blood who are descendants of enrolled ancestors, as defined and 
        derived from section 1, born after the date of the adoption of this constitution 
        (June 26, 1976), except those persons otherwise entitled to enrollment 
        with the Tribe who elect to be enrolled in another tribe.</p>
      <p>Section 3. (b) Only for the purposes of enrollment under this section, 
        all persons of at least one-sixteenth (1/16) Caddo Indian blood, who elect 
        to be enrolled as a Caddo tribal member, shall be allowed to count all 
        quanta of American Indian blood as Caddo Indian blood. Caddo tribal enrollment 
        procedures, after the passage of the amendment, shall recognize and count 
        all amounts of American Indian blood as pertinent to prospective tribal 
        enrollees and to their descendants, except those persons otherwise entitled 
        to enrollment under this constitutional amendment, who elect to be enrolled 
        in another tribe.</p>
      <p>Section 4. Those persons who are adopted into the tribe in accordance 
        with rules prescribed by the Tribal Council, with approval of the membership, 
        and consistent with United States Law.<br>
        Section 5. Those persons who were eligible for membership in the Caddo 
        Tribe of Oklahoma under the previous constitution of January 17, 1938, 
        as amended, who were recognized as members shall continue to be members 
        without further test of eligibility until their deaths or voluntary relinquishment 
        of membership, provided, however, that these persons shall submit an official 
        enrollment application.</p>
      <p>Section 6. Those persons who are eligible for enrollment under the preceding 
        sections of this article who elect to be enrolled, except those persons 
        who have received a share of land or money by virtue of having been listed 
        on an approved membership roll of another tribe.</p>
      <p>Four major constitutional amendments adopted in 2002 changed the organizational 
        name to The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma; affected eligibility for membership, 
        and altered terms of office for elected officials. </p>
      <p>The 2002 amendments did not affect the core definition for membership 
        in the Caddo Nation that requires a person to be of the Caddo Indian blood 
        who received an allotment of land as a member of the Caddo Indian tribe, 
        or a living lineal descendant of an allottee, born on or before the adoption 
        of the 1976 constitution. Only the degree of Caddo Indian Blood was affected 
        by the amendments. </p>
      <p><strong>Who governs the Caddo Nation?</strong><br>
        The Constitution and By-Laws of the Caddo Nation provides a governing 
        body composed of the Tribal Council: four officers elected at large (Tribal 
        Chairman, Vice-chairman, Secretary, Treasurer) and four District Representatives 
        elected by their districts (Binger, Anadarko, Fort Cobb, Oklahoma City). 
        The Administration Building is located in the Caddo Tribal Complex, five 
        miles east of Binger, Oklahoma and approximately 21 miles north of Anadarko 
        at the intersection of highways 281 and 152.</p>
      <p>The original constitution and bylaws of the Caddo Indian Tribe of Oklahoma 
        was revised and ratified in 1976.</p>
      <p>Constitutional Amendment in 2002 changed the period of terms in office 
        for members of the Tribal Council from two years to four years, or until 
        a successor is duly elected and installed in office.</p>
      <p><strong>How did the Caddo Nation receive Federal recognition?</strong><br>
        Federal recognition was established in 1938. Criteria included historical 
        and continued existence of a tribal government, land reserved in Indian 
        Territory by Executive Order, and organization under a constitution and 
        bylaws in conformance to the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936 (49 Stat. 
        1967.</p>
      <p><strong>What is Caddo Country?</strong><br>
        Present Caddo country is defined by Caddo allotments contained in a three 
        county area of southwestern Oklahoma. The General Allotment Act (Dawes 
        Severalty Act) of 1887 provided for the granting of land holdings to individual 
        Indians, replacing the communal tribal holdings. Every man, woman, and 
        child under the Wichita-Caddo Agency was allotted 160 acres during 1901. 
        The total amounted to 152,714 acres. The allotted land is held in trust 
        by the United States.</p>
      <p>&quot;Surplus&quot; land amounting to 586,468 acres was opened to white 
        settlement on August 6, 1901.</p>
