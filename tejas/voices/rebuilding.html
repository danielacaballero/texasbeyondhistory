                  <p class="text">In 1859 official representatives of the United 
                    States presented Caddo chiefs and headmen with the Arbuckle 
                    Agreement that assured Caddos they would occupy <em>a country 
                    belonging to the United States, and not within any State, 
                    where none could intrude upon them; and they would remain, 
                    they and their children, as long as the waters should run, 
                    protected from all harm by the United States</em>. The Superintendent 
                    of Indian Affairs defined boundaries for that country that 
                    were adequate. The certain promise of permanency and protection 
                    satisfied the Caddos' greatest need. In accord with the agents 
                    for the United States government, the chiefs and headmen accepted 
                    the Arbuckle Agreement on July 1, 1859. Upheaval created by 
                    the Civil War soon canceled the Agreement's certainty.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the white man's war most Caddos spent 
                    five debilitating years as refugees in Kansas. Others sought 
                    protection with the Seminole Nation or at Whitebead Hill in 
                    the Chickasaw Nation. It was 1867 before all returned, only 
                    to find their houses ruined, fields and fences destroyed, 
                    livestock stolen and large sections of their assigned territory 
                    taken away. Houses could be rebuilt, fields replanted, and 
                    new livestock raised, but it was not possible to gain self-sufficiency 
                    through farming, hunting, and trade without the security of 
                    a permanent location with adequate acreage.</p>
                  <p class="text">Even as the main body of Caddos were returning 
                    to their Washita River valley home sites, U. S. agents were 
                    negotiating a peace treaty that gave the southern half of 
                    the Leased District to warring Comanches and Kiowas. The treaty 
                    ignored the Arbuckle Agreement that assigned all of the land 
                    from the Chickasaw line to the 100th meridian and from Red 
                    River to the Canadian River to peaceable Caddo, Wichita, and 
                    affiliated tribes. The Agreement was ignored again in 1869 
                    when an Executive Order located Cheyennes and Arapahoes on 
                    a tract overlapping Caddo territory below the Canadian River.</p>
                  <p class="text">Caddo leaders defended their land boundaries 
                    as best they could. They held Council with Agents, pooled 
                    their meager funds, sent representatives with interpreters 
                    to plead their case at the nation's capitol. But, the last 
                    years of the 19th Century passed without a secure land title. 
                    During that time, much was learned about coexistence in a 
                    world dominated by Americans endowed with skills yet to be 
                    acquired by Caddo people.</p>
                  <p class="text">Jose Maria, <em>Iesh</em>, the Anadarko whose 
                    balanced leadership and wisdom guided Caddos, Hainais, and 
                    Anadarkos during turbulent years in Texas, died before the 
                    end of the Civil War. Guadelupe, <em>Nah-ah-sah-nah</em>, was 
                    the accepted leader following the Civil War. Born in 1825 
                    near Natchitoches, Louisiana, he died in 1877. Caddo George 
                    Washington (Sho-ee-tat), the recognized leader of the Whitebead 
                    Caddos before, during, and after the Civil War, died in 1883.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1865 Indians from all of Indian Territory 
                    gathered for a Peace Council held in an area on the Washita 
                    River that covered the entire present city of Verden, Oklahoma. 
                    Disorder and uncertainty had ruled the Territory since the 
                    beginning of the Civil War. The grantees of protection by 
                    the Federal Government was withheld. The Confederate Government 
                    made elaborate offers of protection that seemed, in the beginning, 
                    a better chance for the Indians to maintain their existence. 
                    Indian leaders soon learned that Confederate promises were 
                    never more than spoken words, real protection did not exist. 
                    Errant Plains Indian bands and Texas bandits drove off herds 
                    of Indian cattle and horses without hindrance. The white man's 
                    war created dissension among some tribes. There was fear that 
                    the Plains Indians would go on the war path against settled, 
                    agricultural tribes. Indian leaders realized that inter-tribal 
                    unity was imperative if they wanted to survive. </p>
                  <p><span class="text">The 1865 Peace Council was called to organize 
                    an Indian league. A compact was signed by George Washington, 
                    Tiner, and two other delegates from the Reserve Caddo Nation. 
                    It was also signed by delegates from the Five Civilized Tribes 
                    in the eastern Territory, Osages from the north, Delawares, 
                    and the Kiowas, Comanches, Apaches, Cheyennes and Arapahoes 
                    (called the Plains Indians from the west). Texas officials, 
                    who had considered the possibility of an alliance with all 
                    the Indians in order to help Texas protect her frontier, sent 
                    representatives but they played no part in the council.The 
                    compact incorporated a motto--the great principal of Confederate 
                    Indian tribes-- &quot;An Indian shall not spill an Indian's 
                    blood.&quot;</span><br>

                    kept close tabs on their progress. Children were taught math,

                    George Washington came in one evening and the next morning 
                    he was in the school room when I got up and there he stayed 
                    until bed time, having his meals and drink carried to him 
                    and his team cared for by the children. After all was over, 
                    ending with 'singing geography,' from outline maps, I left 
                    the room. Very soon afterward I heard uproarious laughter 
                    in the school room. This was repeated the third time, when 
                    I slipped out and, looking in the window, found Washington 
                    examining his children to see if they could do anything without 
                    my being present. While he could talk English quite well, 
                    he did not know a thing about the books, charts and maps and 
                    so could not use the points at all, and so the children laughed 
                    at him. He then got behind the class and made each one in 
                    turn use the points and read and spell in English, going over 
                    all that I had through the day and giving the meaning in Caddo. 
                    He knew they knew no English when they came and, in this way, 
                    he proved them as to how much they had learned, and he was 
                    satisfied. </em></p>

                  <p class="text">Caddo elders traditionally schooled a future 
                    caddi (<em>cah-de</em>, a principal leader, chief) from early 
                    childhood. By the time he assumed his hereditary leadership 
                    position, he was prepared with the necessary knowledge and 
                    skills. Forward-looking leaders in 1870 viewed English language 
                    skills as vital for the preparation of the next generation 
                    of leaders. Their nation's most recent history warned against 
                    blind acceptance of oral and written words that led to misunderstanding. 
                    Every council with Americans required an interpreter; every 
                    treaty marked with an X at the end of unreadable names had 
                    failed to meet expectations. Some failures were the result 
                    of hidden meanings or untranslatable English words that were 
                    ineffectively expressed by the interpreter. Words often had 
                    different meanings for people of different languages. There 
                    were times when even the most trusted, competent, interpreter 
                    was unable to transmit the nuance of a word or phrase. Many 
                    interpreters were thought trustworthy, but Caddo interests 
                    were not their prime concern. Wisdom demanded that future 
                    Caddo leaders be as adept in English as well as their native 
                    language. </p>
                  <p class="text">George Washington died in 1883; Guadelupe in 
                    1887. Caddo Jake, <em>Hah-cah'-yo kee na say a</em> (&quot;once 
                    lived in white house&quot;) was generally recognized as principal 
                    chief 1890-1902). Community headmen, also hereditary leaders, 
                    played an increasingly prominent roll in protecting and guiding 
                    the rebuilding the nation whose culture was nearly a thousand 
                    years older than that of the United States of America they 
                    were compelled to accommodate.<br>
                    <br>
                    Major communities grew, much as they always had, from a nucleus 
                    of related families. A man who married a woman from another 
                    community usually went to live as part of her family group. 
                    All lived in substantial log or frame houses on farmsteads 
                    of ten or more acres. Women kept the houses clean and tidy 
                    and tended garden patches; men labored fencing fields, cultivating, 
                    and raising cattle and horses. Lack of industry and effort 
                    did not slow their progress toward self-sufficiency. Blizzards, 
                    drought, and poor soil; a pestilence of grasshoppers and epidemics 
                    of whooping cough, measles, and influenza; Comanche raids, 
                    and Texas horse thieves did.</p>
                  <p class="text">Rations distributed from the Agency staved off 
                    the possibility of starvation and provided a vague semblance 
                    of former days spent in hunting deer and chasing of buffalo. 
                    The Agent made a yearly census listing the names of headmen 
                    and the number of men, women, boys, and girls in their &quot;band&quot;. 
                    Headmen were appointed &quot;beef chiefs.&quot; Traveling 
                    ten or more miles on horseback, in wagons, or in hacks, families 
                    arrived to set up overnight camps. Each &quot;beef chief&quot; 
                    was given a ticket showing his name, the name of his band, 
                    his number on the census roll, the number of persons in his 
                    family, the total number of rations they were entitled to 
                    receive at each issue, and the dates of the issues. </p>
                  <p class="text">These tickets were turned over to the women 
                    who were admitted in line at one door of the commissary, exited 
                    at another. Their task was about as pleasurable as standing 
                    in a long check out line at Super Wal-Mart. An issue clerk 
                    stationed with an interpreter near the entrance punched out 
                    the date on the ticket and called out something like &quot;one 
                    of flour, two of sugar, one soap, and one baking powder.&quot; 
                    The women passed the sacks they brought across a counter to 
                    an assistant clerk who filled them with the measured amount 
                    of flour, sugar, salt, beans, rice, baking powder, and soap 
                    to which they were entitled.</p>
                  <p class="text">High spirits roused when the beef was issued. 
                    The cattle were in a corral where all could see them. Clerks 
                    recorded weights as herders ran them over scales. They then 
                    turned them into a narrow chute that opened onto the prairie. 
                    The issue clerk, assisted by an interpreter, called out the 
                    names of beef chiefs and pointed out the cattle apportioned 
                    to them. The gate was thrown open and as cattle cleared the 
                    chute, two to ten mounted Indians fell behind each one. The 
                    average turnout was one per minute. Boys on ponies let out 
                    a yell and shot arrows in the flank and neck. Men raised their 
                    revolvers or Winchesters to spurt up dust, then shot a bullet 
                    to make the steer stagger on three legs. When the animal fell, 
                    women rushed out to begin the butchering. Thin strips were 
                    cut and hung to dry over camp fires.</p>

                  <br><p class="text">When the Ghost Dance was introduced to Caddos 
                    in 1890, they adapted it to long held religious beliefs. They 
                    had their own songs, and they had a pole. From the time of 
                    the oldest ancestors, Caddos believed: Ah-ah-ha'-yo, father 
                    above, hears our daily prayers; he provides and protects us; 
                    there is a world beyond this one where our people gather after 
                    leaving mother earth. The pole was carved from the heart of 
                    a tall cedar tree. Painted black on one side, green on the 
                    other, it was erected with the black side facing north, the 
                    green side south. The leader stood on the invisible dividing 
                    line at the west side of the pole. Facing east, he began the 
                    first song telling that the feather signifying the right to 
                    lead the Ghost Dance was given to seven men. Sometimes a person 
                    in the dance-in-a-circle would fall in a trance. On waking 
                    from a trance the person would tell of a vision and a new 
                    song would be made. Sometimes healing miracles occurred. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Ghost Dance began in January 1889, when 
                    a Paiute man named Wavoka (Jack Wilson) had a vision during 
                    a total eclipse of the sun. He foretold of a coming natural 
                    disaster that would swallow up the Whites and allow Indians 
                    to return to their lands and way of life. Wavoka's vision 
                    spread quickly among diverse groups across the Plains and 
                    beyond. John Moon-head Wilson, from the Caddo tribe, was one 
                    of the charismatic leaders who helped spread the Ghost Dance 
                    in 1890. By taking part in the five-day dance, Indians believed 
                    that they would be reunited with their loved ones in the ghost 
                    world. The speed and fervor with which the movement spread 
                    sparked panic among white settlers and authorities and figured 
                    prominently in the events that led to the massacre at Wounded 
                    Knee.</p>
                  <p class="text">Ghost dancing relieved uncertainty that clouded 
                    the hopes of Caddo people. The songs were a form of communication 
                    with the great Father Above. White people did not understand  
                    and wanted to take it away. Failed attempts to gain permanent 
                    title to the land they lived on made them apprehensive that 
                    the &quot;Great Father&quot; in Washington would take it away 
                    if he chose to do so. </p>

                    Caddo&#151;under an Agency titled Wichita and Affiliated Tribes 
                    in 1859 has since tended to confuse anyone unfamiliar with 
                    their separate histories. References to the Wichita Agency 
                    and the Wichita Reservation compounded the confusion. It implies 
                    the close association of unrelated members. The Caddo, the 
                    Wichita, and Delaware were affiliated but Caddos, Anadarkos, 
                    and Hainais were never affiliates, they were all of one blood. 
                    Likewise, Wacos, Tawakonis and Keechis were never affiliates 
                    of the Wichita, they were all of one blood.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1889 the federal government began appointing 
                    commissions to &quot;negotiate&quot; with Indian tribes holding 
                    large territories to break these up into small individual 
                    allotments (160 or 80 acres) for each adult member of the 
                    tribe and open up everything else to white settlers. In addition 
                    to taking more Indian land, the process had the intended effect 
                    of destroying tribal governments and forcing the integration 
                    of Indians into American society. At the same time Indian 
                    children were being separated from their parents and being 
                    forced to attend boarding schools where they were taught in 
                    English and forbidden to speak their native tongue. </p>
                  <p class="text">The commission that dealt with Caddo and Wichita 
                    lands was called the Cherokee or Jerome Commission, after 
                    its chairman, David H. Jerome. The Jerome Commission, Presidential 
                    appointees charged with the task of negotiating with the Wichitas 
                    on the subject of accepting allotment of their lands in severalty, 
                    actually had to deal with two individual Indian Nations&#151;Wichita 
                    and Caddo&#151;each unwilling to accept the government's proposal. 
                    Allotment in severalty meant giving each member possession 
                    of a 160 or 80 acres, breaking up Indian Nations, and opening 
                    unalloted land for white settlement. </p>
                  <p class="text">Chairman Jerome opened the council in May of 
                    1891 with words that echoed those heard by Caddos before signing 
                    the treaty that ceded their Louisiana homeland to the U.S. 
                    in 1835. Jerome's statement, another commissioner's remarks 
                    and the response of Caddo Jake, Caddo principal leader, are 
                    in the record of the proceedings. </p>
