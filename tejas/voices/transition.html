                  <p class="text">Caddo grandmothers and grandfathers have long 
                    told about the beginning of Caddo people and how the first 
                    leaders were chosen. It is said that in the Beginning, people 
                    and animals all lived together in a world of darkness until 
                    a person named <em>Nesh </em>(&quot;Moon&quot;) came to lead 
                    them to a new world of light. Nesh called all of them together 
                    and told them they must hold council and choose the wisest, 
                    the strongest, and bravest among them to be their leader. 
                    The people decided that Nesh was that one and they would call 
                    him <em>Caddi</em> (cah-de). Nesh said he would be their Caddi, 
                    he knew the way. Then, because there were so many people, 
                    he said they must first divide into groups and each group 
                    should select a headman. After that was done, Nesh called 
                    all the headmen together. He gave each a drum to beat as they 
                    were led up into the new world of light where they built their 
                    first homes. It is also said that men built the first Caddo 
                    houses, but <em>Sah Caddo</em>, a woman, told them how to do 
                    it. </p>
                  <p class="text">From that beginning until the twentieth century, 
                    a principal leader called Caddi worked in concert with community 
                    headmen (first called <em>canahas</em>, latter called chiefs) 
                    to govern Caddo civic and ceremonial affairs. Their positions 
                    were hereditary, passing from father to son or if need be, 
                    to wife's nephew or sister's son. Chosen successors were apprentices, 
                    learning from elder leaders. They were not allowed to assume 
                    their titled positions until they were sufficiently prepared 
                    and deemed old enough to be wise, strong, and brave leaders. 
                    The Caddi paid close attention to views presented by the canahas; 
                    meetings could last for hours. Decisions made by the Caddi 
                    after hearing all points of view, were accepted, respected, 
                    and adhered to without question. </p>
                  <p class="text">Among the last men to fill traditional hereditary 
                    roles were Caddo Jake (1890-1902), Whitebread (1902-1913), 
                    Enoch Hoag (1913-1920), Harry Edge (1920-1922), Amos Longhat 
                    (1922-1923), Charles Adams (1923-1937). It was their lot to 
                    spend three decades defending Caddo rights to live as wished 
                    within the boundaries of the Indian Territory land where the 
                    United States placed them in 1859. In councils with agents, 
                    meetings with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the President 
                    in Washington D. C., even following the white man's road by 
                    employing legal counsel, they expressed the right and desire 
                    of Caddo people to live as they always had, holding land in 
                    common for the benefit of all. Petitions, protests, and direct 
                    appeals detoured, but could not block the treacherous trail 
                    Congress opened with passage of the General Allotment Act 
                    (Dawes Severalty Act) in 1887. That Act provided for the granting 
                    of individual land holdings to individual Indians, replacing 
                    communal tribal holdings. </p>

                  <p>To his excellency, The President of the United States, <br>
				  Executive Mansion, Washington, D.C.</p>
                  <p align="right"><em>February, 3 1888</em></p>
                  <p><em>Whitebread, a chief of the Caddo tribe of Indians would 
                    say to his great Father that, at the request of his people, 
                    he has come a long journey to see him and ask him to listen 
                    for a little while that he may learn the wants and wishes 
                    of his children who are so far away.</em></p>
                  <p><em>Whitebread knows that the great Father has so many people, 
                    whose interests he must care for, that only a little while 
                    can be spared to hear him. Therefore he will speak but few 
                    words and as directly as he can.</em></p>
                  <p><em>Last winter one of his old men, a chief of his tribe was 
                    here, and told the Commissioner of Indians affairs that his 
                    people were not prepared for, and did not wish their lands 
                    to be allotted to them. There were many reasons for this. 
                    First because they had no country that they could call their 
                    own&#151;that where they now live was by the sufferance of 
                    the great Father's government, growing out of an agreement 
                    which his people, and the people with whom he now lives (the 
                    Wichitas and other bands) has never authorized to be made, 
                    and which had never been ratified by the government of the 
                    U.S. or by the affiliated bands. Second, because his people, 
                    when they had a country of their own, lived mostly by hunting 
                    and cultivating small patches of ground, and were used to 
                    moving from place to place in the spring and summer where 
                    the grass was good, and the streams were running with clear 
                    water, and in winter where they could find shelter from the 
                    storms and wood to make fires. Such had been the custom of 
                    their fathers and fore-fathers farther back than their tradition 
                    went, and which they had inherited for so many generations 
                    that it had become a part of their nature, and it was hard 
                    to get rid of. </em></p>
                  <p><em>Their old men and the present generation had this way 
                    of living in their hearts. They now know that the game is 
                    disappearing, the buffalos are all gone, and the elk is no 
                    longer seen in their ancient hunting grounds, and the deer 
                    and antelope, in their country almost extinct, and his people 
                    feel that they must as fast as they can, take up and follow 
                    the course of the white man. The old men are preparing for 
                    this and are trying as well as their untutored ways will allow, 
                    to teach their children in this way. His people believe that 
                    the great Father and his people desire to aid them in this 
                    and to promote their happiness and make them good people. 
                    But he would remind his great Father that the ignorant red 
                    children of the plains and mountains are like little infants 
                    and that it requires much patience and care to teach them 
                    to crawl and walk, and advance by slow degrees to maturity. 
                    He believes that before his generation dies out this good 
                    end may be attained, but it is only to be reached by patient 
                    effort. Where ever their homes have been their country has 
                    been enjoyed in common. If one place failed in grass or water, 
                    or did not give sufficient protection they could hunt another 
                    without hindrance. If confined to one spot, and the soil were 
                    unproductive and their corn and vines withered from the drought 
                    and the water dried up they could hunt a better place. </em></p>
                  <p><em>Besides these things they are ignorant of the use of many 
                    things easy to the white man. They know that a few farmers 
                    and black-smiths and carpenters and mill-wrights are sent 
                    to teach them, but how can two or three or even a dozen farmers 
                    and one or two other mechanics of each class teach, or attend 
                    the wants of several thousand people widely scattered over 
                    a territory many miles in width and length, and among a people 
                    with but few of the implements and tools necessary, and where 
                    there are not many gentle oxen and horses for use. </em></p>
                  <p><em>We beg to assure our great Father what we are doing out 
                    best, we are trying to teach our young men and children the 
                    way of the white man, and we believe if not too much hurried 
                    that in a few years we will be able to make our own selections, 
                    if we have granted to us a country of our own, where we can 
                    build on our cabins, clear our grounds, make our homes and 
                    raise our children. Then we will be glad to say to our Father 
                    your children have traveled the white man's road a while, 
                    he finds it good, and we want you to allot to us our home. 
                    My people have instructed me to say to you that they hope 
                    you will set aside the order designating the Caddos and affiliated 
                    bands as tribes when allotments should be made.</em> </p>

                    the President. During negotiations to secure Wichita-Caddo 
                    acceptance of individual allotments in 1891, David Jerome, 
                    the Cherokee or Jerome Commission Chairman, admonished Caddo 
                    and Wichita leaders that dissolution of lands reserved for 
                    them was coming &quot;one way or the other, either as we propose 
                    or under the law.&quot; For purposes of allotment, the United 
                    States considered Wichita and Caddo, two individual Indian 
                    Nations as one. The agreement forced upon their leaders was not 
                    what their people wanted, it was what they had to accept to 
                    retain a home place. A great effort to repudiate the agreement 
                    forced such a way proved futile. It was accepted and ratified 
                    by an Act of Congress, March 2, 1895.</p>

                  <p>Speaker, Thomas Wister:</p>
                  <p><em>I am glad to shake hands with my white brother today, 
                    and I know that he sympathizes with me and wants to help us 
                    in every way that he can. We come to you because we know you 
                    to be our friend. We have but few friends. We do not trust 
                    many white men. We have been fooled too often, but we know 
                    you and know by your face that you are our friend, and we 
                    ask you to protect us in the possession of our homes, so that 
                    we may keep our land for our wives and our children. We cannot 
                    be white men. The Great Spirit made us to follow a different 
                    road, and if we try to follow the white man's road, we make 
                    a failure of our life. If you are satisfied to let us follow 
                    the Indian road, we can support ourselves and be happy.</em></p>
                  <p><em>We look around us and see other Indian tribes. Some of 
                    them have been allotted, and are trying to live like white 
                    men. They do not succeed. Seven years ago the Cheyennes and 
                    Arapahoes were rich people. They had plenty of horses and 
                    cattle and were living peaceably and happy. The white man 
                    has come among them. They have been put on to little pieces 
                    of land; they have sold their horses, eaten up their cattle, 
                    and are hungry and naked. We are poor, but not so poor as 
                    the Cheyennes, for we still have our land and can raise cattle. 
                    Nobody can raise cattle on 160 acres of the land in our country. 
                    You know it is, for you have seen it. You know that the cattlemen 
                    who pasture cattle in our country twelve or fifteen acres 
                    to keep one steer. We ask you to try and have Congress have 
                    pity upon us, and wipe out this law that has been made, and 
                    make a new one so that we may keep our reservation as it is, 
                    and continues to live as we are living. </em> </p>

                  <p class="text">Special allotting agents began their work in 
                    the spring of 1897. Their progress was impeded by two major 
                    obstacles: surveying the territory for allotment was an undertaking 
                    almost as daunting as an original survey of virgin country; 
                    and, they found &quot;great opposition among the Indians.&quot; 
                    Work was suspended. When resumed in March 1901, pressure to 
                    complete work in time for a July 1 opening of surplus lands 
                    to white settlers pushed changes in processing allotments 
                    that created confusion. Initially instructed to stay on selected 
                    allotments, Caddos remained there for weeks without knowing 
                    that the process had been changed. Allotment agents followed 
                    behind the surveying teams. Decisions on allocations became 
                    hasty as work hurried toward a finish.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Secretary of Interior approved 965 allotments 
                    on the Wichita-Caddo reservation on July 4, 1901. Some were 
                    selected by individuals, some assigned by agents. Surplus 
                    land, amounting to 586,468 acres, was made available for white 
                    settlement. The land parceled out in 160 acre allotments to 
                    Wichitas, Caddos, and Delawares amounted to 152,714 acres&#151;about 
                    one-fifth of the land they had occupied since 1859 when it 
                    was pledged &quot;they would remain, they and their children, 
                    as long as the waters should run, protected from all harm 
                    by the United States.&quot;</p>
