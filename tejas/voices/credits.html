            <p class="text">Caddo Voices was researched and written by <strong>Cecile 
              Elkins Carter</strong>, who also took many of the pictures and gathered 
              most of the archival photographs. An enrolled member of the Caddo 
              Indian Tribe of Oklahoma, she became interested in Caddo history 
              when she was in her 30s. &quot;I read somewhere that we were 'virtually 
              extinct,'&quot; she recalled. &quot;Well, I knew we were not extinct, 
              but if we were once strong and powerful, how did we become weak 
              and pitiful? That's what I wanted to find out.&quot; What she found 
              out is the subject of her 1995 book <em>Caddo Indians Where We Come 
              From</em> (University of Oklahoma Press). Carter has also served 
              as the Caddo tribe's cultural liaison, written scholarly articles 
              on the Caddo dance tradition, and given dozens of presentations 
              and story-telling performances to audiences ranging from school 
              children (her favorite) to academic researchers. She continues to 
              document Caddo history through personal interviews, video taping, 
              and archival research.</p>
