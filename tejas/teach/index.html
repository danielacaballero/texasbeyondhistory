            <p class="text">Welcome, Teachers. We have sought to bring you a wealth 
              of resources on the Caddo Indians that may be explored by you and 
              your students. As a first step, you may choose to look through <a href="../fundamentals/index.html" class="text">Caddo 
              Fundamentals</a>. This set of &quot;exhibits&quot; provides a broad 
              overview of the Caddo people, their homeland, languages, and the 
              larger sphere of influence in which they operated. You may also 
              want to review the children's activities created specifically for 
              this exhibit and correlated to the teacher's resources. Entitled 
              <a href="../../kids/caddo/index.html" class="text">World of the 
              Caddo</a>, this highly interactive set of colorful exhibits includes 
              Mounds of Mystery, Explore a Caddo Village, Meet the Caddo People 
              (past and present), Build a Caddo House, and Traces of the Past, 
              a &quot;virtual museum of amazing objects created by the Caddo. 
              The latter section also provides insights in how archeologists study 
              the ancient Caddo in &quot;Searching For Clues.&quot; </p>
            
          <p class="text">The first of two lessons on the Caddo, <em><strong>Making 
            a Caddo Circle Book</strong></em>, was created by TBH Educational Consultant 
            Dr. Mary Black. In this innovative lesson, students write, draw, and 
            use mathematics to create a short booklet about the Caddo Indians. 
            Addressing numerous objectives of the Texas Essential Knowledge and 
            Skills, this interdisciplinary lesson is suitable for grades 4 and 
            7. It is presented in PDF format for easy downloading and printing 
            for use in class. <a href="Caddo_Circle_Book1.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">Download 
            lesson plan.</a> </p>
          <p class="text">The second lesson on the Caddo is aimed at high school 
            history students. <em><strong>Who's Buried Where - And Why? Finding Cultural 
            Universals with the Ancient Egyptians and Texas Caddo</strong></em>, was 
            created by TBH Educational Consultant Carol Schlenk. This lesson illustrates 
            that certain human values and practices do not change over time or 
            with location. Cultural universals are the basic behaviors practiced 
            by all cultures, regardless of location or era. Studying cultural 
            universals helps us understand the customs of other societies both 
            historically and in today's multicultural world. Humans burying and 
            honoring their dead is one of these cultural universals. In this lesson, 
            students will discover that burial practices of the Caddo Indians 
            in east Texas around 1000 years ago and those of the ancient Egyptians 
            over 4000 years ago, had a number of interesting differences and similarities. 
            Addressing numerous objectives of the Texas Essential Knowledge and 
            Skills, this interdisciplinary lesson is suitable for high school 
            levels. It is presented in PDF format for easy downloading and printing 
            for use in class. <a href="../../teach/images/human-burials.html" target="_blank">View
