            <p class="text">The Caddo cultural tradition can be traced back confidently 
              to at least 1200 years ago or about A.D. 800, the year Charlemagne 
              was crowned the first Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III. We know 
              about Charlemagne through written accounts by eyewitnesses and later 
              historians. But the Caddo, like all other North American tribes 
              north of Mexico, did not have a writing system; instead they kept 
              history in their heads in what must have been a very lively 
              and complex oral tradition. Through the recitation of sacred stories 
              and songs, oral traditions can and often do convey significant memories 
              and understandings of times long past, contrary to what many of 
              us raised in societies with strong written traditions may believe.</p>
            <p class="text">Most of the particulars of early Caddo 
              history that were maintained by oral tradition have been lost to 
              time, especially to the drastic changes and catastrophic losses 
              of life forced upon the Caddo by the invasion of America by Europeans. 
              Ironically, the &quot;literate&quot; European cultures brought about 
              the wholesale destruction of the carefully maintained oral histories 
              of so many &quot;nonliterate&quot; Native American societies. Be 
              that as it may, there are surviving bits of early Caddo history 
              preserved in the traditions maintained by Caddo peoples today, in 
              early Spanish and French accounts, and in later written histories 
              as well as in the oral traditions recorded by ethnographers and 
              folklorists.</p>
            <p class="text">These sources serve us reasonably well for the last 
              300 years or so, but beyond that we do not have much to go on. Some 
              of the recorded Caddo stories, origin &quot;myths,&quot; or &quot;legends&quot; 
              collected by late 19th-century scholars do contain tantalizing clues 
              about early Caddo ancestors. For instance, ethnologist James Mooney 
              recorded this story:</p>

                    mouth of a cave in a hill which they call Cha&acute; kani&acute; 
                    na, &quot;the place of crying,&quot; on a lake close to the 
                    south bank of Red River, just at its junction with the Mississippi. 
                    In those days men and animals were all brothers and all lived 
                    together under the ground. But at last they discovered the 
                    entrance to the cave leading up to the surface of the earth, 
                    and so they decided to ascend and come out. First an old man 
                    climbed up, carrying in one hand fire and a pipe and in the 
                    other a drum. After him came his wife, with corn and pumpkin 
                    seeds. Then followed the rest of the people and the animals. 
                    [But a wolf blocks the hole sealing many animals and people 
                    still inside the earth.] Those who had come out sat down and 
                    cried a long time for their friends below, hence the name 
                    of the place. Because the Caddo came out of the ground they 
                    call it ina,&quot;mother,&quot; and go back to it when they 
                    die. Because they have had the pipe and the drum and the corn 
                    and pumpkins since they have been a people, they hold fast 
                    to these things and have never thrown them away. From this 
                    place they spread out toward the west, following the course 
                    of Red River, along which they made their principal settlements. 
                    For a long time they lived on Caddo Lake, on the boundary 
                    between Louisiana and Texas, their principal village on the 
                    lake being called Sha'childi'ni, &quot;Timber Hill.&quot;

              and the brink of world destruction. While these help us understand 
              Caddo worldview, they tell us few facts about early Caddo history.

            <p class="text">As discussed in <a href="../fundamentals/learning.html" class="text">Learning 
              about the Caddo Past</a>, the three major sources of information 
              about early Caddo history are archeology, biological anthropology, 
              and linguistics. Archeology and biological (or physical) anthropology 
              depend on archeological finds. Studies of the Caddoan languages 
              suggest that ancestors of the Caddo and the ancestors of the Plains 
              Caddoans (Wichita, Kichai, Pawnee, and Arikira) split from a common 
              ancestor (ancestral group) in the distant past, at least 3,000 years 
              ago and probably even earlier. The Caddo cultural tradition as recognized 
              now by archeologists begins about 1200 years ago (A.D. 800). What can we say about the ancestors of Caddo speakers between 1200 
              and 3,000 years ago? The short answer is &quot;not enough.&quot; 
              While we know something about various sites and cultural patterns 
              in and near the Caddo homeland between about 1200-3000 years ago, 
              we are not yet certain which patterns represent the direct ancestors 
              of today's Caddo.</p>
            <p class="text">Explaining how and why the Caddo cultural tradition 
              developed when and where it did and how it changed through time 
              is a challenging task for four reasons that must be made clear. 
            </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>(1) Archeological cultures are not the same as 
              human social groups.</strong> Distinct human social groups (tribes, peoples, 
              nations) are typically defined based on differences in language, 
              dress, physical appearance, territory, and custom. Archeologically, 
              many of these distinctions are invisible: stones and pottery sherds do 
              not speak. Therefore, an archeological &quot;culture&quot; is merely 
              a perceived pattern of sites with similar arrays of preserved artifacts 
              that may or may not correspond to a real social group. Archeologists 
              call these patterns <strong>cultures</strong>, <strong>traditions</strong>, and <strong>phases</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>(2) Archeologists dig up stones, bones, and pottery sherds, 
              not cultures</strong>. Linking specific types of artifacts to specific 
              archeological cultures is a tedious and tenuous process that involves 
              much guesswork. It is not until the arrival of European chroniclers 
              that we have the first written accounts that give tribal names and 
              meager descriptions. Even then it is often very difficult to link 
              known groups to archeological patterns.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>(3) Archeologists need sizable <u>and </u><em>dated</em> artifact 
              samples from many different places</strong> before they can make good 
              inferences regarding how archeological sites and the people who 
              created them relate to one another. We need large samples in order 
              to detect statistically meaningful patterns. But large artifact 
              samples do not have much meaning unless we know how old the artifacts 
              are and the specific places they came from. While archeologists can often estimate the &quot;relative&quot; 
              or approximate age of a distinctive artifact such as a pottery sherd or whole vessel
              of a particular style, most artifacts are not distinctive enough 
              to be dated tightly. The most reliable dating method in the Caddo 
              area is <a href="../../glossary/index.html#r" class="text">radiocarbon 
              dating</a>, a method of estimating the age of organic materials 
              such as charred wood or bone based on the measured ratio of radioactive 
              C14 to normal carbon. But radiocarbon dates are expensive (up to 
              $700 apiece) and multiple dates are needed from a single context 
              (hearth, house, layer, etc.) to obtain  secure calibrated date ranges. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>(4) Most archeological sites contain a mixture 
              of artifacts from different time periods and cultures</strong>. This 
              is simply because most sites are located near streams and rivers 
              in places well suited for human occupation. Even today many farmhouses, 
              towns, and cities stand atop traces of ancient settlements. When 
              the materials from different periods of time are neatly stacked 
              into separate layers like a layer cake, archeologists can recognize 
              changes through time. Most sites in the Caddo homeland 
              are not neatly layered and materials from different time periods 
              are often mixed together, making it difficult or impossible to sort 
              out what goes with what.</p>
            <p class="text">Our understanding of the ancestral traces of the Caddo 
              cultural tradition is hampered by all four of these factors. The 
              physical evidence we do have from sites in the region that are thought 
              to date between 1000-3000 years ago is not very abundant and often 
              problematic. Overall, relatively few sites dating to this time span 
              have been identified confidently and most contain a mix of materials 
              of different age. Even fewer sites have been excavated and of these, 
              only a handful can be considered securely dated. So we are forced 
              to make do with meager evidence as we try to sketch out the early 
              history of the ancestral Caddo.</p>
            <p class="text">Keep these limitations in mind as you explore the 
              Caddo Ancestors exhibit. In archeology, our interpretations can 
              only be as good as the data we base them on. As more and more is 
              learned, archeologists reevaluate earlier ideas and interpretations, 
              refining some, rejecting others, and reaching new understandings.

                    the various language groups are thought to have split from 
                    one another. How long ago the various splits occurred is very 
                    poorly known. Linguistic estimates suggest that, prior to 
                    about 3,500 years ago, the ancestors of all of the groups 
                    were a single people who spoke an ancestral language that 
                    linguists call Proto-Caddoan. About 3,500 years ago (1500 
                    B.C.) the ancestors of the Northern Caddoan groups split from 
                    the Caddo and the two languages began to diversify. (Some 
                    archeologists think the initial split may have occurred thousands 
                    of years earlier.) Sometime after the time of Christ, the 
                    Proto-Northern-Caddoan speakers began splitting off, first 
                    the Wichita, then the Kitsai, and finally the Pawnee. Still 
                    later (not long before Europeans arrived) the Arikara split 
                    from the Pawnee and Pawnee split into two groups.</div>

                    clues, but they alone are nothing more than bits of fired 
                    clay. It is the association of such clues with dated contexts 
                    (like a house or a burial) that gives meaning to mere fragments 
                    of the past. TARL archives. </div>

                    (right) dating less than a 1000 years old at many Caddo sites. 
                    The Caddo usually established villages on higher terrain overlooking 
                    stream valleys. At such places, the landforms are stable, 
                    meaning that very little soil accumulation occurs and thus 
                    things of different ages become mixed in the upper few inches.

                    County, Texas. TARL archives.</div>
