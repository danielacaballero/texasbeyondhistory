                  <p class="text">Woodland period cultural developments help us 
                    understand the crystallization of the Caddo culture tradition 
                    around A.D. 800. As is the case with the Archaic, the Woodland 
                    concept began as a developmental stage and is used as a major 
                    time period dated somewhat differently from region to region. 
                    Between about <strong>1000 and 400 B.C. the use of pottery spread</strong> 
                    across the Eastern Woodlands followed by (and sometimes accompanied 
                    by) increasingly settled village life, the building of burial 
                    mounds, the establishment of extensive long-distance trade 
                    networks (or the expansion of existing ones), the development 
                    of elaborate ritual practices, the domestication and cultivation 
                    of native plants with starchy and oily seeds, and the rise 
                    of societies led by hereditary leaders. These Woodland period 
                    developments span two millennia from about 1000 B.C. to as 
                    late as A.D. 1000 and, as discussed in the previous section, 
                    can be traced back to patterns that began in the Archaic period. 
                    Because the timing and nature of these Woodland developments 
                    varied considerably across the Southeast, it is difficult 
                    to make accurate generalizations. Here we will stick primarily 
                    to what is known about the Caddo area and the adjacent lower 
                    Mississippi Valley. </p>
                  <p class="text">Occupying the southwestern edge of the Eastern 
                    Woodlands, the Caddo Homeland was a cultural frontier of sorts 
                    that lay beyond (west of) the areas where most of the early 
                    and middle Woodland developments took place. Pottery, for 
                    instance, did not reach east Texas until after 500 B.C. and 
                    was not in common use in some parts of the area until over 
                    a thousand years later. Yet, by Late Woodland times, before 
                    A.D. 800 or so, a seemingly precocious Early 
                    Caddo culture emerged with many of the elements considered 
                    characteristic of the Caddoan tradition after A.D. 1000. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Explaining or even briefly reviewing Woodland 
                    developments as they relate to the ancestors of the Caddo 
                    is a challenge. We do not have enough solid data to explain 
                    what happened century by century or even subperiod by subperiod 
                    because somewhat different things happened at different times 
                    in different areas. For some areas, such as the lower Mississippi 
                    Valley, the timing and sequence of developments is relatively 
                    well known. This is not the case in most of the Caddo Homeland. 
                    So we will divide this section into two parts: <a href="#1" class="text">Woodland 
                    Developments Through Time</a> and <a href="#2" class="text">Woodland 
                    Cultures of the Greater Caddo Homeland</a>. The first part 
                    summarizes the chronological sequence of Woodland developments 
                    in the nearby lower Mississippi Valley with discussion of 
                    certain related developments in the Caddo area. The second 
                    part reviews the specific Woodland period cultures from which 
                    Caddo culture developed.</p>
                  <h3><a name="1"></a>Part 1: Woodland Developments Through Time 
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text">Only a few days travel by canoe downstream from 
                    the Great Bend of the Red River is the lower Mississippi Valley 
                    (LMV), a region that helps us understand the Woodland period. 
                    The rich environment of the wide, alluvium-filled valley with 
                    its many river channels, tributaries, oxbow lakes, and meandering 
                    bayous supported relatively large human populations for thousands 
                    of years. It was here (including the adjacent lower Ouachita 
                    River basin near Monroe, Louisiana) that the first earthen 
                    mounds were built by Middle Archaic peoples as early as 6,000 
                    years ago (4000 B.C.). In Late Archaic times, about 3700-3000 
                    years ago (1700-1000 B.C.), Poverty Point culture flourished 
                    in the same area. While these early cultures have no known 
                    parallel in the Caddo Homeland, they set the stage for a succession 
                    of Woodland cultures in the LMV that interacted with Caddo 
                    ancestors for over a thousand years. </p>
                  <p class="text">The sequence of cultures in the LMV is relatively 
                    well known because the region's abundant archeological sites, 
                    many of them with impressive earthen mounds, have long attracted 
                    investigation. Two of the most famous American archeologists, 
                    James Ford and Gordon Willey, excavated a series of mound 
                    sites in the LMV in the late 1930s and early 1940s and triggered 
                    a decades-long debate concerning the origin and evolution 
                    of the mound-building cultures of the region. Ford's hypothesis 
                    that cultural developments in the LMV were derived from Mesoamerican 
                    cultures (like the Olmec) is no longer seen as valid. Instead, 
                    the LMV appears to have a very long history of indigenous 
                    (local) development within which were periods of great interaction 
                    with other cultures of the Eastern Woodlands and periods of 
                    relative isolation.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>Early Woodland</strong> period in the LMV 
                    is called the <strong>Tchefuncte culture</strong> and dates to between 
                    800-200 B.C. Tchefuncte (pronounced cha-funk-tee) peoples 
                    lived along the coast of Louisiana and the inland waterways 
                    of the LMV. They were hunters, fishers, clam-harvesters, and 
                    plant gatherers. The atlatl (spear or dart-thrower) and dart 
                    was the favored weapon. Most Tchefuncte sites are relatively 
                    small and only a few are known to have mounds. The known mounds 
                    appear to be burial mounds covering flexed or bundled burials. 
                    (Bundle burials are defleshed and disarticulated skeletons 
                    that were later reassembled and tied together in individual 
                    bundles.) There are few special grave offerings or other evidence 
                    of the existence of different social classes. Instead Tchefuncte 
                    societies seem to have been egalitarian. Trade connections 
                    to other areas of the Southeast are few compared to what came 
                    before (Poverty Point) and after (Marksville). </p>
                  <p class="text">Tchefuncte culture is best known for its pottery 
                    and is the first LMV culture to make much pottery. (Some earlier 
                    fiber-tempered pottery is known from Poverty Point, however.) Tchefuncte 
                    pottery is soft and poorly fired; its highly distinctive paste 
                    appears laminated (layered) and poorly mixed and may not contain 
                    temper. (Tchefuncte pottery was probably made by the paddle 
                    and anvil technique instead of the coil method.) It looks 
                    like potters were experimenting with a new technology and 
                    taking part in what has been called the &quot;container revolution.&quot; 
                    The most common vessel forms are simple globe-like bowls and 
                    &quot;flower pot&quot; jars. The exterior surfaces are often 
                    decorated with stamped designs, incised lines on bodies and rims, 
                    and punctations. Also common are teat-shaped legs or supports, 
                    often occurring in sets of four. </p>
                  <p class="text">The earliest pottery in the Caddo Homeland dates 
                    to perhaps 400 B.C. and appears to be derived from the Tchefuncte 
                    culture. Scattered finds of Tchefuncte pottery are known from 
                    the Caddo area. For instance, two reconstructable vessels 
                    were found at the Resch site in Harrison County, Texas on 
                    a tributary of the Sabine River. The Tchefuncte jar from Resch 
                    shown on the right is better made than most and has grog (pulverized 
                    pottery) temper. Tchefuncte-like pottery (most of it locally 
                    made) is more common in southeast Texas, indicating contact 
                    with LMV peoples or perhaps some Tchefuncte groups migrated 
                    westward along the upper Texas Gulf coast. In later Woodland 
                    times, the Mossy Grove culture (see Part 2) continued a tradition 
                    of sandy paste pottery that may have had Tchefuncte origins.</p>
                  <p class="text">Following Tchefuncte in the LMV is the <strong>Marksville 
                    culture</strong> (about 200 B.C. to A.D. 500) during the <strong>Middle 
                    Woodland</strong> period. This era is a time of population growth 
                    and larger sites, many of which have conical burial mounds 
                    and some have more elaborate earthworks. Marksville pottery 
                    is harder and better made than Tchefuncte pottery and has 
                    more variation in form and decoration. Stamped and incised 
                    bowls are particularly common. Incised birds, curvilinear 
                    patterns, and deep U-shaped incisions are characteristic Marksville 
                    pottery decorations. The basic economy was still hunting, 
                    gathering, and fishing; the atlatl was still in use. Perhaps 
                    the most outstanding feature of Marksville culture is the 
                    extensive evidence for interaction with Hopewell peoples in 
                    Illinois and other distant locales.</p>
                  <p class="text">Numerous mound sites are known in the LMV that 
                    date to early Marksville times (prior to A.D. 200) including 
                    the large, complicated Marksville site in south-central Louisiana 
                    that gave the culture its name. The Marksville site had a 
                    C-shaped earthen embankment some 1000 meters (almost 1100 
                    yards) long and 2 meters (6 feet) high within which were five 
                    mounds, at least three of which were conical burial mounds. 
                    Two mounds had flat tops and may have been platforms for special 
                    structures, perhaps temples, although this is uncertain. Within 
                    one of the burial mounds was a log-covered pit sealed by layers 
                    of cane and clay that may represent a &quot;charnel&quot; 
                    house where the bodies of the dead were processed before mass 
                    burial. </p>
                  <p class="text">Many examples of elaborate mortuary ritual are 
                    found at Middle Woodland sites including cremation, bundle 
                    burials, separate burial of skulls and mandibles, mass burials, 
                    and exotic grave offerings. At Crooks Mound in south-central 
                    Louisiana, a large conical burial mound some 26 meters (85 
                    feet) in diameter and over 5 meters (16 feet) high contained 
                    the remains of 1159 individuals buried separately in different 
                    episodes of mound use. Most burials were in the flexed position, 
                    but numerous isolated skulls, mandibles, and bundle burials 
                    were also found. A small number of grave goods including whole 
                    pottery vessels and an assortment of exotic items such as 
                    copper ear spools show connections with distant peoples. While 
                    the extraordinary concentration of burials at Crooks is by 
                    far the largest known, burial mounds are thought to represent 
                    communal cemeteries that served a particular social group.</p>
                  <p><span class="text">The early Marksville culture was part 
                    of the <strong>Adena-Hopewell</strong> phenomenon, a broad cultural 
                    pattern or &quot;interaction sphere&quot; that can be found 
                    in much of the Midwest throughout the Mississippi River drainage 
                    system. Adena culture is known mainly from the Ohio River 
                    valley and is the Early Woodland predecessor (about 600-100 
                    B.C.) of Middle Woodland Hopewell. Major Hopewell sites have 
                    conical burial mounds and elaborate earthworks, some shaped 
                    like birds or animals, and are concentrated in two core areas, 
                    one in central Ohio and the other to the west in central Illinois. 
                    While some archeologists once thought that the Marksville 
                    culture was the result of the movement of Hopewell groups 
                    down the Mississippi, most now believe that Marksville represents 
                    the local evolution of Tchefuncte culture and their contact 
                    with Hopewell peoples elsewhere. </span></p>
                  <p class="text">Whatever the exact mechanism, ideas and exotic 
                    items linked to ritual and symbols of power moved long distances 
                    during the Middle Woodland period. The exotic (non-local) 
                    objects are found as grave goods in Hopewell and Marksville 
                    burial mounds. Items such as ear spools, bracelets and beads, 
                    pendants and gorgets (chest ornaments) made of exotic copper, 
                    stone, pearl, and marine shell, quartz crystals, elaborately 
                    decorated ceramic vessels, platform pipes, celts made of green 
                    stone, and finely made large dart or spear points have been 
                    found at hundreds of Middle Woodland sites across the central 
                    and southeastern United States. Altogether, the raw material 
                    sources and the Hopewell-related burial mound locations form 
                    a vast network extending over 800 miles east-west and some 
                    1000 miles north-south. </p>

                    Mound</strong> on the Louisiana side of the Sabine River under 
                    what is now Toledo Bend Reservoir. This conical burial mound 
                    was 24 meters in diameter (78 feet) and 2.5 meters high (8 
                    feet) and contained at least 35 cremation deposits, 14 bundle 
                    burials, 10 fire basins, and 14 artifact caches (the mound 
                    was only partially excavated). Beneath the mound was a single 
                    primary cremation that was capped by the first layer of the 
                    mound. All of the burials within the mound were in secondary 
                    context and had been placed in the mound after being cremated 
                    or prepared elsewhere, which suggests that mortuary rituals 
                    were complex. The fact that most of the cremation deposits 
                    were confined to very small areas 6 to 12 inches (15-30 centimeters) 
                    in diameter indicates they may have been contained in individual 
                    baskets placed in small pits. This pattern might be expected 
                    if the cremations occurred elsewhere, perhaps even miles away, 
                    and fits in with the notion that Coral Snake Mound was a communal 
                    cemetery that served people living along that stretch of the

                  <p class="text">Only a few of the burials at Coral Snake Mound 
                    were definitely accompanied by grave goods, but small numbers 
                    of exotic artifacts were placed into the mound as caches or 
                    discrete clusters. Some artifact caches and other isolated 
                    artifacts may actually represent burials in which the bones 
                    did not survive. Regardless, these artifacts clearly represent 
                    purposeful deposits of offerings honoring the dead. Among 
                    the unusual artifacts are rolled copper beads, copper gorgets, 
                    perforated raccoon teeth, two Marksville pottery vessels, two boatstones 
                    (ground and polished artifacts shaped like a boat), and a 
                    unique quartz figurine. The captions of the accompanying photographs 
                    provide further details. </p>
                  <p class="text">Three radiocarbon dates and the associated Marksville 
                    pottery vessels indicate that Coral Snake Mound was in use during Middle 
                    Woodland times in the early centuries A.D. Some effort was 
                    made to locate contemporary habitation areas that might have 
                    been associated with the mound/cemetery, but none were found. 
                    Scattered artifacts found in and near the mound such as pottery 
                    sherds, flint flakes, and broken dart points, probably represent 
                    occupational debris, but the mound site itself appears to 
                    be mainly a cemetery. The precise cultural affiliation of 
                    Coral Snake is debated. While it could represent an as-yet 
                    poorly known local Woodland group, Arkansas archeologist Frank 
                    Schambach argues that Coral Snake Mound is part of Fourche 
                    Maline culture.</p>
                  <p class="text">Another somewhat similar site is the <strong>Jonas 
                    Short Mound</strong> located on the Angelina River under what is 
                    today Sam Rayburn Reservoir, some 40 miles (70 kilometers) 
                    west of Coral Snake. The Jonas Short Mound was 29 meters (94 
                    feet) in diameter and 2.4 meters high (almost 8 feet) and 
                    was built over the cremated remains of at least two individuals 
                    placed into a shallow pit. Charcoal and scorched earth suggest 
                    that the cremation took place within the pit, followed soon 
                    by the building of the mound, probably in two stages. The 
                    cremated remains were accompanied by two copper bracelets. 
                    Five artifact caches were found in the mound fill that may 
                    have accompanied burials (if so, the bones decayed completely) 
                    or may be offerings honoring the cremated individuals. Among 
                    the unusual artifacts in these caches are boatstones, perforated 
                    elk teeth, a copper reel-shaped gorget, large chipped stone 
                    knives (bifaces), an extraordinary polished dart point, and 
                    11 quartz crystals, five of which were shaped and perforated 
                    or grooved to serve as pendants. </p>
                  <p class="text">The date of Jonas Short Mound is uncertain, 
                    but it probably also dates to the Middle Woodland period as well 
                    and may be a bit earlier than Coral Snake judging by the reel-shaped 
                    copper gorget. Similar artifacts are known from early Marksville 
                    burial mounds and in burial mounds of the Adena culture of 
                    the Ohio River valley far to the northeast. The presence of 
                    plain sandy paste pottery and the absence of Marksville 
                    pottery or bone- or grog-tempered pottery suggests that Jonas 
                    Short was created by a different culture than that of Coral 
                    Snake (or possibly by the same culture in earlier days). It 
                    falls within the area where the Mossy Grove culture existed, 
                    as discussed in Part 2. Schambach thinks Jonas Short is also 
                    part of the Fourche Maline tradition.</p>
                  <p class="text">Other Middle Woodland sites with burial mounds 
                    occur in the vicinity of the Great Bend of the Red River in 
                    northwest Louisiana and southwest Arkansas. In fact, there 
                    are probably as many Middle Woodland mound sites in the eastern 
                    part of the Caddo Homeland as there are in the LMV, although 
                    few are well known. The Bellevue Mound and related sites in 
                    northwest Louisiana were thought by earlier researchers to 
                    represent a phase of the Marksville culture. Such LMV-centric 
                    views are no longer widely held today, as archeologists in 
                    the region see much evidence of local developments that parallel 
                    those of the lower Mississippi Valley. Arkansas archeologist 
                    Frank Schambach sees these sites as early expressions of Fourche 
                    Maline culture (see Part 2).</p>
                  <p class="text">In Arkansas, Shane's Mound and Red Hill Mound 
                    are examples of burial mounds with similar grave offerings 
                    to those found at Coral Snake including a Marksville stamped 
                    bowl containing copper beads (Red Hill). Both mounds are associated 
                    with nearby habitation areas (middens) and both are attributed 
                    to Fourche Maline. Interestingly, both the Bellevue Mound 
                    and the Cicero Young Mound (in Arkansas) were built over the 
                    remains of structures, a practice which is common at Caddo 
                    sites. These may be early examples of mounds that mark civic 
                    and ritual centers. This is hard to demonstrate because what 
                    little work has been done at most of these sites has focused 
                    only on the mounds themselves.</p>
                  <p class="text">The succeeding <strong>Late Woodland</strong> era in the 
                    lower Mississippi valley is divided into two periods, <strong>Baytown</strong> 
                    (about A.D. 500 to 750) and <strong>Coles Creek</strong> (about A.D. 
                    750 to 1000), and is a time of great change. Compared to Marksville, 
                    there are more sites, much more ceramic variability, more 
                    densely concentrated populations, and fewer graves with exotic 
                    offerings. Three new developments during the Late Woodland 
                    in the LMV are particularly important: the gradual adoption 
                    and increasing importance of agriculture, the replacement 
                    of the atlatl and dart with the bow and arrow around A.D. 
                    700, and the construction of planned villages and civic/ritual 
                    centers (&quot;mound centers&quot;) with flat-topped structural 
                    &quot;platform&quot; mounds arranged around an open plaza. 
                    These complex and interlinked changes coincide with (and are 
                    no doubt related to) comparable developments in many parts 
                    of the Midwest and Southeast including the Caddo Homeland. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">We would argue that by about A.D. 800, developments 
                    in the LMV no longer overshadow and anticipate those in the 
                    Caddo area. Said differently, Caddo culture emerges as a distinct 
                    pattern during the Late Woodland period. </p>
                  <h3><a name="2"></a>Part 2: Woodland Cultures in and near the 
                    Caddo Homeland </h3>
                  <p class="text">The above map shows the approximate location 
                    of some of the major archeological cultures dating to the 
                    Woodland period between about 500 B.C. and A.D. 700. As we 
                    have seen, there was a succession of Woodland cultures within 
                    the LMV spanning this 1200-year era. Unfortunately, the chronology 
                    of Woodland developments in the Caddo area is poorly known 
                    except by general comparison to the LMV sequence. Somewhat 
                    clearer is the geographical distribution of some of the major 
                    Woodland cultural patterns in and near the Caddo Homeland 
                    as shown in the accompanying map. Before discussing the three 
                    Woodland cultures whose boundaries partially overlap with 
                    the area that would soon become the main Caddo Homeland, brief 
                    mention will be made of three related patterns, two comparatively 
                    well known and the other newly proposed and a matter of debate.</p>
                  <p><span class="text">The influence of Middle to Late Woodland 
                    cultures of the LMV seems to have extended well up the Red 
                    River into the southeastern part of what would become the 
                    Caddo Homeland. Based on data from excavations at the Fredericks, 
                    Black Lake Bayou, and Lemoine sites (among others) in the 
                    vicinity of Natchitoches, Louisiana, archeologist Pete Gregory 
                    has defined the Fredericks phase (about A.D. 400-700) and 
                    succeeding Lemoine phase (A.D. 700-900). Sites of both phases 
                    are dominated by what appear to be locally made LMV pottery 
                    types. By A.D. 1000, Early Caddo sites dominate the area, 
                    but it is not clear whether this represents the movement of 
                    people or the spread of the Caddo cultural tradition into 
                    the Natchitoches area. </span></p>
                  <p class="text">The Late Woodland Plum Bayou culture existed 
                    in the alluvial lowlands along the lower Arkansas and White 
                    rivers and the adjacent Mississippi Valley in eastern Arkansas 
                    between A.D. 700-1000. The best-known Plum Bayou site is Toltec 
                    Mounds, a major civic/ritual mound center containing 18 earthen 
                    mounds enclosed by a C-shaped pattern of earthen berms and 
                    ditches. Ten of the mounds at Toltec are arranged around a 
                    rectangular plaza centered on the largest mound, which is 
                    about 15 meters (50 feet) high. Plum Bayou culture developed 
                    out of Baytown and is considered by many to be the northern 
                    part of the LMV Late Woodland pattern. Interaction with Fourche 
                    Maline and early Caddo peoples to the west and southwest is 
                    indicated by similarities in pottery and by imported lithic 
                    (stone) materials from the Ouachita Mountains in southwest 
                    Arkansas. </p>
                  <p class="text">Schambach proposed the name &quot;Mulberry 
                    River&quot; to characterize the Woodland culture that inhabited 
                    the valleys of the middle Arkansas River and its tributaries 
                    to the north of the Ouachita Mountains in eastern Oklahoma 
                    and northwestern Arkansas. Mulberry River culture is said 
                    to be ancestral to the Arkansas Basin (&quot;Northern Caddoan&quot;) 
                    culture that developed in the same area after A.D. 900 and 
                    created the spectacular Spiro site. While some Oklahoma archeologists 
                    apparently consider the area part of the Fourche Maline Woodland 
                    culture, Schambach sees Mulberry River as being distinct from 
                    Fourche Maline. He points to differences in artifacts, settlement 
                    patterns, and adaptation that set the two cultures apart. 
                    The most compelling line of evidence comes from a study of 
                    dental patterns that suggests the peoples living in the Arkansas 
                    Valley were genetically distinct from those living in the 
                    main Caddo Homeland from Woodland times forward. </p>
                  <p class="text">Be this as it may, Oklahoma archeologist Don 
                    Wyckoff sees no archeological basis for considering local 
                    Woodland sites to be anything other than Fourche Maline. As 
                    discussed below, the name and the original definition of Fourche 
                    Maline culture is based on work done along tributaries 
                    of the Arkansas River in eastern Oklahoma. Published statements 
                    by various Oklahoma archeologists including Jerry Galm, Robert 
                    Bell, and Wyckoff state that Fourche Maline sites are only 
                    found in the valleys of the northern Ouachita Mountains, while 
                    the Arkansas Valley, proper, was unoccupied until after A.D. 
                    700.</p>
                  <p class="text">Suffice it to say that the Mulberry River culture 
                    concept is still in its infancy and may not survive. Proposed 
                    archeological concepts are often like that&#151;some stick 
                    and some sink. Happily, here we are far more concerned with 
                    the Woodland cultures of the main Caddo Homeland south of 
                    the Arkansas River Valley.</p>
                  <h3>Fourche Maline Culture </h3>
                  <p class="text">The most distinctive Woodland cultural pattern 
                    in the main Caddo Homeland is the long-lived Fourche Maline 
                    (pronounced foosh-ma-lean) culture tradition. It is named 
                    after a creek in the Wister Valley of southeastern Oklahoma 
                    where the &quot;type&quot; sites (those first used to define 
                    the pattern) were excavated by WPA teams in the late 1930s. 
                    These sites had distinctive thick, dark middens called &quot;black 
                    mounds&quot; that contained a mix of Archaic, Woodland, and 
                    Northern Caddoan artifacts as well as burials. </p>
                  <p class="text">Beginning in the 1970s, the Fourche Maline concept 
                    has been expanded and redefined by Frank Schambach to characterize 
                    the Woodland cultures in southeastern Oklahoma, southwestern 
                    Arkansas and adjacent areas of Louisiana and Texas. Beginning 
                    dates are uncertain, but the earliest Fourche Maline sites 
                    probably date to Early Woodland times, before 500 B.C., while 
                    the latest date to A.D. 800 (or later), a span of at least 
                    13 centuries. Schambach has divided the Fourche Maline time 
                    span into seven numbered periods that correspond to the LMV 
                    sequence. He has also defined six Fourche Maline phases covering 
                    different subareas and spans of time. Because the dating for 
                    these phases (and the periods, too) is based mainly on cross-dating 
                    with LMV ceramics, other archeologists, such as Story and 
                    Perttula, regard them as highly conjectural.</p>
                  <p class="text">Outside the Wister Valley, the best archeological 
                    evidence of Fourche Maline culture comes from the Red River 
                    and Ouachita River drainages in southwestern Arkansas where 
                    some 700 related sites have been recorded. Southwestern Arkansas 
                    and adjacent areas of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas appear 
                    to have been the core area of Fourche Maline culture where 
                    some of the oldest, largest, and most intensively occupied 
                    sites are found. Fourche Maline sites are known for their 
                    thick, black middens resulting from habitation and trash accumulation 
                    over lengthy periods of time. It is assumed that villages 
                    once stood in these places, although little direct evidence 
                    of dwellings have been found, probably because Fourche Maline 
                    houses were not very substantial. While most sites are relatively 
                    small, larger villages covering 2 hectares (about 5 acres) 
                    also occur. </p>
                  <p class="text">The hallmark of Fourche Maline culture is a 
                    well-developed ceramic tradition known for its plain and minimally 
                    decorated flat-bottomed vessels. The most common form is a 
                    jar shaped like a flower pot. Fourche Maline ceramics typically 
                    have thick walls and are tempered with a variety of materials 
                    including grog, bone, grit, and sand. The most common type 
                    is Williams Plain followed by Cooper Boneware and Ouachita 
                    Plain. Excavations of Fourche Maline middens often yield thousands 
                    of pottery sherds. Trade pieces of Marksville and Coles Creek 
                    pottery are known, but more common are locally made imitations 
                    of LMV pottery. Other characteristic artifact types include 
                    Gary dart points and, after about A.D. 500, expanding stem 
                    arrow points, as well as boatstones, double-bitted &quot;axes&quot; 
                    (possibly gardening hoes), clay platform pipes, and seed grinding 
                    and nutting stones. </p>
                  <p class="text">The economy of Fourche Maline peoples is still 
                    something of a mystery. They obviously continued the Archaic 
                    hunting and gathering tradition and lived in part off of deer, 
                    turkey, and hickory nuts as well as many other wild plants 
                    and animals. The mysterious part is the extent to which they 
                    were gardeners. It seems likely that, through time, Fourche 
                    Maline peoples began growing various native crops including 
                    the starchy and oily plants that were domesticated first in 
                    the American Midwest as well as squash and bottle gourds. 
                    While little direct evidence of gardening so far has been 
                    recovered from Fourche Maline sites, this is probably due 
                    mainly to the recovery techniques used by archaeologists. (Small charred seeds are 
                    only preserved in favorable conditions and can only be recovered 
                    by using a specialized soil processing method called flotation.) 
                    Indirect evidence of horticulture includes the presence of 
                    double-bitted &quot;axes&quot; (possible garden-hoe blades), 
                    the dense refuse accumulations (black middens) at many Fourche 
                    Maline sites, and the increasing evidence that neighboring 
                    Woodland groups living east, north, and west of the area were 
                    part-time gardeners. </p>
                  <p class="text">Fourche Maline burial practices are generally 
                    similar to Woodland patterns in the Midwest (Adena-Hopewell). 
                    In the Red River valley of southwestern Arkansas, the earliest 
                    burial mounds (ca. 200-100 B.C.) were built on bluff tops 
                    away from habitation areas. These small domed mounds were 
                    built over crematoria (places where cremations took place), 
                    a common Early and Middle Woodland pattern in the Eastern 
                    Woodlands. Some cremated remains and grave offerings are found 
                    within the mounds, but cremation cemeteries such as the Johnny 
                    Ford site suggest that bodies were burned in one place and 
                    interred in another. Somewhat later mounds such as Shane's 
                    mound covered central pits containing cremated remains but 
                    also have small offering deposits (caches) of exotic Hopewell-related 
                    artifacts similar to those found at Jonas Short Mound, 150 
                    miles to the southwest. (While Schambach considers Jonas Short 
                    to be a Fourche Maline site, Story considers the pottery found 
                    there to be that of Mossy Grove culture.)</p>
                  <p class="text">Between A.D. 100-300, burial mounds such as 
                    those at Red Hill and McKinney in the Red River valley were 
                    no longer built over crematoria. Instead they have secondary 
                    deposits of cremations (McKinney) that are associated with 
                    exotic Hopewell-related artifacts, and Marksville Stamped 
                    bowls. Although neither of these mounds is well known, Schambach 
                    believes they are similar to Coral Snake Mound, which he also 
                    considers to be a Fourche Maline site. The latest Fourche 
                    Maline burial mounds are Mounds C and D at the Crenshaw site 
                    and are thought to date to A.D. 600-700. These mounds were 
                    built in stages and have deposits of skulls and mandibles 
                    with pottery vessels and other offerings that were placed 
                    on the surfaces of the mound stages and then covered by thin 
                    clay caps.</p>
                  <p class="text">Schambach argues that Fourche Maline culture 
                    represents the mother culture from which the Caddo cultural 
                    tradition develops and sees Fourche Maline peoples as the 
                    direct ancestors of later Caddo peoples. There is much evidence 
                    to support this view. The most obvious is the fact that the 
                    core area of Fourche Maline closely coincides with the core 
                    area of the Caddo Homeland coupled with the absence of a gap 
                    in time between the two cultural traditions. There are seemingly 
                    abrupt changes in behavior including new burial patterns, 
                    ceramic styles, increased mound building, increasing use of 
                    mounds as building platforms, ritual destruction and capping 
                    of public buildings, and the introduction of maize agriculture. 
                    Nonetheless, these appear to represent local social and economic 
                    developments rather than the movement of a new people into 
                    the area. While these changes may seem abrupt, the cultural 
                    transformation from Fourche Maline to Early Caddo probably 
                    transpired over several hundred years (ca. A.D. 700-900) and 
                    it may well be more complicated than implied by the mother 
                    culture idea. There are two other Woodland cultures in east Texas that probably 
                    contributed to the development of the Caddo cultural tradition, 
                    Mossy Grove and Mill Creek.</p>
                  <h3>Mossy Grove Culture </h3>
                  <p class="text">The Woodland period archeological pattern in 
                    southeast Texas along the upper Gulf coast and inland into 
                    the southern part of the Piney Woods looks quite different 
                    from Fourche Maline. Many of the differences obviously relate 
                    to the contrasting environments. Southeast Texas has greater 
                    rainfall, higher humidity, a longer growing season, more swamps, 
                    less oak-hickory forest, and, of course, the estuaries, bays, 
                    and barrier islands along the Gulf Coast. These environmental 
                    differences resulted in dissimilar economic patterns, access 
                    to raw materials (scarcity of stone, for instance), shelter 
                    needs, and so on. The area is also less conducive to farming. 
                    Farther inland toward what would become the southern boundary 
                    of the Caddo Homeland, away from the relatively narrow river 
                    valleys, there are deep sandy soils that are not very fertile 
                    and dry out quickly during droughts. </p>
                  <p class="text">From early historic records we know that much 
                    of Southeast Texas, particularly along the coast and major 
                    bay systems (and adjacent inland areas), was occupied by non-Caddoan 
                    speakers such as the Bidai, Atakapa, and Akokisas peoples. 
                    The archeological record suggests that the historically known 
                    patterns began developing thousands of years ago, certainly 
                    by Woodland times.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the early 1990s, Dee Ann Story called attention 
                    to the archeological similarities across much of Southeast 
                    Texas, especially the shared sandy paste pottery tradition, 
                    and termed this pattern the Mossy Grove cultural tradition. 
                    While the Mossy Grove tradition can be traced into historic 
                    times, our interest here is on the Woodland or &quot;Early 
                    Ceramic&quot; period, beginning by at least 200 B.C. and probably 
                    earlier. Unfortunately for our present purpose, the archeological 
                    sequence of the coastal Mossy Grove culture is much better 
                    known than that present within the southern part of the area 
                    we recognize as the Caddo homeland.</p>
                  <p class="text">The hallmark of Mossy Grove culture, its sandy 
                    paste ceramic tradition, was probably introduced or inspired 
                    by the Tchefuncte culture in the LMV as is evident from finds 
                    of Tchefuncte-like pottery at both coastal and Inland Mossy 
                    Grove sites. In contrast to the thick-walled, flat-bottomed 
                    plainwares of Fourche Maline, Mossy Grove peoples created 
                    relatively thin-walled, round- or conical-bottomed vessels. 
                    The double-bitted axes and polished stone artifacts found 
                    in Fourche Maline sites are absent. Mossy Grove projectile 
                    points include small Gary and Kent dart points and, after 
                    about A.D. 500-600, expanding stem arrow points of the Friley and 
                    Scallorn types. These artifacts and various knives (bifaces) 
                    and heavier chopping tools are made of poor quality local 
                    materials, often petrified wood. Another local raw material 
                    for making chipped stone tools is Manning glass, a fused volcanic 
                    material that outcrops in a narrow east-west band near the 
                    southern limit of the Caddo Homeland just north of Huntsville, 
                    Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the northern Mossy Grove area, along the 
                    upper Angelina and Neches River valleys, Woodland sites are 
                    very common and account for 25-50 percentage of the known sites. The 
                    increase in sites compared to the Archaic period is also coupled 
                    with a shift in settlement location from upland areas and 
                    higher ridge tops to the low sandy ridges (&quot;interfluves&quot;) 
                    overlooking the confluences of small drainages. Archeologist 
                    Jim Corbin has speculated that this shift may be tied to the 
                    beginnings of gardening, although so far there is no direct 
                    evidence of early domesticated plants. The sandy, acidic sediments 
                    of the area make for poor preservation of organic materials.</p>
                  <h3>Mill Creek Culture </h3>
                  <p class="text">In East Texas to the west and south of the Red 
                    River and its tributary, the Sulphur River, Woodland archeological 
                    sites seem to differ significantly from the Fourche Maline 
                    pattern. For one thing there are far fewer Woodland sites 
                    and those that are present are smaller and do not seem to have 
                    the characteristically thick, black middens with abundant 
                    Williams Plain pottery. The relatively small amounts of pottery 
                    that the East Texas sites have is more varied; it is typically 
                    thinner than Williams Plain and more often decorated with 
                    incised lines, punctations, and other designs. Archeologist 
                    Tim Perttula has argued that these and other differences 
                    suggest that a distinct cultural pattern existed in the western 
                    frontier of the Eastern Woodlands in the Pineywoods of East 
                    Texas and the Post Oak Savanna. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Mill Creek culture encompasses the period 
                    from about 200 B.C. to A.D. 800 and is contemporaneous with 
                    Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove, but different from either. 
                    Sites of this culture are known mainly in the Big Cypress Creek
                    and Sabine River basins in East Texas, but apparently continue 
                    eastward into northwest Louisiana. Because relatively few 
                    Mill Creek sites have been recognized and investigated by 
                    archeologists, the concept must be regarded as quite tentative. 
                    (Like Mulberry River culture, Mill Creek culture is an idea that may or may not become widely accepted.)</p>
                  <p class="text">Perttula hypothesizes that Mill Creek groups 
                    moved around more (i.e., were less sedentary) than Fourche 
                    Maline groups, based on the presence of only relatively small sites 
                    and small middens. The fact that ceramics are not abundant 
                    at Mill Creek sites compared to Fourche Maline or Mossy Grove 
                    sites, may represents regional differences in food processing. 
                    Mill Creek peoples appear to have relied on traditional cooking 
                    and storage techniques such as pit-oven cooking and storage 
                    pits rather than on ceramic technology. Mill Creek peoples 
                    still practiced the hunting and gathering lifestyle of their 
                    Archaic predecessors and relied heavily on nuts and deer. 
                    No structures, burials, or burial mounds have yet been identified 
                    at Mill Creek sites. Stone tools include small Gary and Kent 
                    dart points eventually being replaced by expanding-stem arrow 
                    points about A.D. 600-700. Ground stone tools, particularly 
                    manos and pitted nutting stones are common. Double-bitted 
                    &quot;axes&quot; are uncommon as are other potential gardening 
                    tools. Most stone tools are made of local quartzite, sandstone, 
                    siltstone and petrified wood.</p>
                  <p class="text">The best known Mill Creek site is the Herman 
                    Bellew site, which overlooks Mill Creek, a tributary of the 
                    Sabine River in northern Rusk County. The Woodland ceramics 
                    from the site include sandy paste, grog-tempered, and bone-tempered 
                    sherds, a relatively high percentage of which are decorated 
                    (6 percentage compared to less than 3 percentage for most Fourche Maline sites). 
                    Despite relatively extensive excavation, only 225 sherds were 
                    recovered at Herman Bellew. In comparison, many Fourche Maline 
                    sites have yielded thousands of sherds.<br>
                    <br>
                    According to Perttula and archeologist Linda W. Ellis, Mill Creek pottery differs from the 
                    typically thick, grog-tempered Williams Plain. Instead, there 
                    is a mix of sandy paste wares, bone-tempered wares, and thinner 
                    grog-tempered wares, primarily plain. Mill 
                    Creek groups may have adopted ceramic ideas and technologies 
                    from the two neighboring Woodland cultures with whom they 
                    were interacting. From the Fourche Maline tradition came grog- 
                    and bone-tempered pottery with mainly flat-based bowls and 
                    jars combined with the Mossy Grove tradition of non-tempered 
                    sandy paste wares with round-based vessels. Alternatively, 
                    the apparent borrowing from adjacent cultures may simply be 
                    changes through time in manufacturing technique and vessel 
                    shape that represents the evolution of ceramic use for different 
                    purposes by Mill Creek peoples.</p>
                  <p class="text">Another important difference between Fourche 
                    Maline and Mill Creek is the presence in the latter of rock 
                    hearths and storage pits. Small rock hearths (probable earth 
                    ovens) and larger concentrations of fire-cracked cooking stones 
                    were found in Woodland contexts at Herman Bellew, suggesting 
                    that the Archaic pattern of using hot rocks to cook plant 
                    foods (especially roots) was still prevalent. Another example 
                    of a continued Archaic pattern is a large storage pit dating 
                    to about A.D. 100-200. </p>
                  <h3>Woodland Summary: </h3>
                  <p class="text">What can we say about the cultures that came 
                    just before the Caddo? While a great deal remains to be learned 
                    before we can trace the early ancestors of the Caddo people, 
                    some of the larger patterns seem clear. Woodland peoples were 
                    living throughout Caddo Homeland for over a thousand years 
                    before A.D.800-900, the period when the Caddo cultural tradition 
                    is first recognized by archeologists. During the 1300 years 
                    between 500 B.C. and A.D. 800, Woodland peoples in the region:

                      leadership</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text">These developments and changes were not simultaneous, 
                    and they did not take place all across the region. We still 
                    do not understand either the exact sequences of development, 
                    or the processes of change. In a sense most of these Woodland 
                    elements were different parts of the same general process:  
                    the transformation from small egalitarian groups of mobile 
                    hunters and gatherers to larger, ranked societies who depended 
                    on agriculture.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Fourche Maline culture of the Red River 
                    valley was almost certainly the main &quot;mother&quot; culture 
                    out of which the Caddo cultural tradition evolved. But that 
                    does not mean that all of the ancestral Caddo groups were part 
                    of the Fourche Maline tradition. Ancestral Caddo peoples may 
                    have been responsible for the Mill Creek culture to the south 
                    and west of the Fourche Maline. Mossy Grove culture, on the 
                    other hand, probably represents the ancestors of non-Caddo 
                    peoples, but they were clearly interacting with Mill Creek 
                    and Fourche Maline peoples. Said differently, Woodland groups 
                    across the Caddo Homeland developed localized ways of doing 
                    things that had their origins long before A.D. 800. The smaller 
                    groups that lived on the western and southern fringes were 
                    probably perceived as being akin to &quot;country hicks&quot; 
                    (or perhaps even enemies) by the larger, more mainstream groups 
                    that lived in the Caddo &quot;heartland&quot;&#151;the Red 
                    River Valley at and below the Great Bend.</p>

                        the Caddo Homeland just north of Huntsville, Texas. This 
                        material was used by local Caddo peoples to make stone 
                        tools. It is, however, characteristically fractured, as 
                        this piece is. It is also usually found in small nodules. 
                        This example is the largest known nodule of Manning Fused 
                        Glass, measuring about a meter across (39&quot;). Photo
