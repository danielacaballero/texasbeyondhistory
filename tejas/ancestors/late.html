                  <p class="text">About 500 years ago, Caddo population reached 
                    an all-time high. Caddo ritual centers, villages, hamlets, 
                    and farmsteads existed in all but a few areas of the Caddo 
                    Homeland, such as parts of the middle Sabine Valley and upper Sulphur River basin. Such areas had 
                    been settled earlier and may have been abandoned because of 
                    localized climatic conditions, declining soil fertility, or, 
                    more likely, because they fell between the territories of 
                    rival groups. Early Spanish accounts make it clear that the 
                    Caddo world was made up of small competing societies (polities) 
                    who were never politically united. Instead, various groups 
                    formed alliances and friendship pacts to protect their own 
                    territories, provide access to trade routes and scarce resources, 
                    and to join forces to fight enemies. Lists of enemies complied 
                    by the Spanish show that Caddo groups sometimes counted other 
                    Caddo groups among their enemies. This fluid world of small 
                    competing societies and shifting alliances seems to fit well 
                    the archeological evidence of the <strong>Late Caddo period (ca. 
                    A.D. 1400-1680)</strong>.</p>
                  <p class="text">The ending date for the Late Caddo period of 
                    A.D. 1680 is chosen because soon thereafter the European invasion 
                    began to cause major, irreparable changes to Caddo societies. 
                    Archeologists sometimes use the term protohistoric to refer 
                    to the period after the first contact with European culture 
                    and before the period of sustained interaction. In the case 
                    of the Caddo, the first contact was with DeSoto's army in 
                    1542-1543, but it would be another 143 years (A.D. 1686) before 
                    Europeans returned to the area. In the intervening <strong>protohistoric</strong> 
                    <strong>period</strong>, European diseases, horses, Old World plants, 
                    and trade goods likely began to reach some Caddo groups. But the 
                    real impact of these European introductions did not take hold 
                    until the late 1600s.</p>
                  <p class="text">It is during the period between about A.D. 1400 
                    and A.D. 1680 that we see the greatest number of distinct 
                    geographical clusters (territories) across much of the Caddo 
                    Homeland. These are relatively small areas about 60-100 miles 
                    long and 25-50 miles wide within which we find similar Late 
                    Caddo pottery styles and other ways of doing things. Archeologists 
                    call these geographic clusters <strong>phases</strong> and they probably 
                    each represent the combined territory of several allied groups 
                    that intermarried and shared close ritual, economic, social, and military 
                    ties. The accompanying maps show some of the phases that have 
                    been defined, but you should realize that these are just approximations 
                    that are only as accurate as the field information. In areas 
                    that have seen lots of archeological work, such as much of 
                    northeast Texas, the phases are reasonably well known. For 
                    many other areas, they are not.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the Great Bend area of the Red River, Caddo 
                    archeological sites dating after ca. A.D. 1400 are included 
                    in the contemporaneous Belcher and Texarkana phases. <strong>Texarkana 
                    phase</strong> sites occur on the Red River northwest of Texarkana 
                    to the Arkansas/Oklahoma state lines, as well as on the lower 
                    Sulphur River. <strong>Belcher phase </strong>sites (ca. A.D. 1500 to 
                    the late 1600s) are distributed from about Fulton, Arkansas, 
                    to below Shreveport, Louisiana. Upstream from the Texarkana 
                    phase, the <strong>McCurtain phase</strong> represents another distinct 
                    Late Caddo cluster of related sites in northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the Texarkana and Belcher phase areas, sites 
                    include large, permanent settlements with mounds and cemeteries, 
                    hamlets, and farmsteads. The mound centers were marked by 
                    the construction of earthen mounds that were used as temples, 
                    burial mounds, or ceremonial fire mounds. These settlements 
                    were inhabited by sedentary Caddo agricultural communities 
                    with complex societies led by individuals with high status 
                    who lived at the mound centers. Mound centers such as Belcher, 
                    Battle, Hatchel, and Cabe represent the larger villages or 
                    towns. Hamlets or farmsteads have been investigated at the 
                    Sherwin and Atlanta State Park sites for the Texarkana phase 
                    and the Cedar Grove and Spirit Lake for the Belcher phase. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Both the larger communities and the smaller 
                    hamlets/farmstead had pole and grass structures (usually circular), 
                    outdoor ramadas or arbors (for shade), household cemeteries, 
                    and middens filled with household refuse. The 1691 Ter&aacute;n 
                    de los R&iacute;os map of the Nasoni village on the Red River 
                    documented the likely character of individual farmstead compounds 
                    and the layout of a dispersed village. In northwestern Louisiana, 
                    Belcher phase sites are distributed along Red River channels 
                    and meanders that are no longer active today (the river's 
                    course shifted repeatedly in historic times). Cowhide Bayou 
                    and Red Chute Bayou in the Shreveport area are good examples 
                    of once-active channels along which Late Caddo sites are found. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Texarkana phase sites appear to date from ca. 
                    A.D. 1400-1700, and mound construction seems to coincide with 
                    the main period of settlement at the Hatchel site, from about 
                    A.D. 1400-1700. Both archeological and historical information 
                    suggests that the main platform mound (with many levels of 
                    structures and features) at the Hatchel site may be the <em>templo</em> 
                    or temple mound shown on the 1691 Ter&aacute;n map of the upper Nasoni 
                    village. The Horace Cabe mound may also have been occupied at this 
                    time, as well as the Eli Moores mound site, and the Moore/Higginbotham mound center and community 
                    a few miles downstream from the Horace Cabe site probably represents 
                    the upper Cadohadacho village that was eventually abandoned 
                    in 1788. </p>
                  <p class="text">Like other Caddo groups on the Red River, the 
                    <strong>McCurtain phase</strong> settlement pattern includes numerous 
                    habitation sites (with household cemeteries and substantial 
                    midden deposits) and mound centers. The mounds appear to have 
                    mainly been constructed between ca. A.D. 1300-1500. In some 
                    instances, mound centers were not directly associated with 
                    permanent settlements or middens. The McCurtain phase mounds 
                    were generally constructed in one or two stages over important 
                    public structures, with the structure abandoned, dismantled 
                    and/or burned, then capped with a fill zone of soil scraped 
                    from nearby deposits. Simple and elaborate single and multiple 
                    burials were also placed in the mounds, as with the East Mound 
                    at the Sam Kaufman site on the Red River. </p>
                  <p class="text">Caddo settlements along this stretch of the 
                    Red River seem to closely resemble those depicted in the Ter&aacute;n 
                    map and Soule photograph; Caddo villages were composed of 
                    individual compounds of houses and other structures associated 
                    with mounds and the residence of a <em>caddi</em> or chief. The density 
                    of McCurtain phase sites indicates that greater numbers of 
                    people are living in closer proximity than before. At the 
                    Sam Kaufman site the mound in McCurtain phase times was used as 
                    a place for the burial of the social elite. A shaft tomb containing 
                    10 individuals and many grave goods was found near the center 
                    of the mound, which had been excavated through the remains of a burned temple structure. Special purpose salt-processing sites, such 
                    as the Salt Well Slough site (41RR204) are also common in 
                    the vicinity of the Sam Kaufman site.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>Frankston phase</strong> is comprised of farmsteads, 
                    hamlets, and small villages in the Neches and Angelina river 
                    basins in East Texas that date from ca. A.D. 1400-1680. The 
                    only Frankston phase site known to have mounds is the <strong>A. C. 
                    Saunders site</strong>. Excavations there in the early 1930s by 
                    crews from the University of Texas led by A. T. Jackson provides 
                    us with a unique glimpse of Late Caddo ritual life. The first mound (Feature 1) 
                    itself was not very high (2.2 meters or 7 feet) but it was 
                    broad covering an area about 26 by 33 meters (85 by 107 feet). 
                    Trenches into it showed that it was made up of thick deposits 
                    of ash capped by a clean layer of sandy loam; very few artifacts were recovered in the excavations there. </p>

                          This village was part of the Cadohadacho alliance. The 
                          map shows that the community consisted of small farmsteads

                    capped a large circular structure (13.5 meters or 44 feet 
                    across) with a large doorway (gap in the posts) facing east. 
                    Within the building was one hearth and there was a larger 
                    one at its entrance and several others outside the building, 
                    some of which were used after the building had been dismantled 
                    and capped with incredibly rich midden deposits containing 
                    fragments of an estimated 1291 pottery vessels (dominated 
                    by Poynor Engraved carinated bowls, Bullard Brushed and Maydelle Incised 
                    jars, and LaRue Neck Banded jars), many fragments of elbow-shaped 
                    ceramic pipes, Perdiz arrow points, stone drills, mussel shell 
                    digging tools, and an assortment of bone tools (awls, needles, 
                    and beamers) as well as some shell columnella beads. Large 
                    quantities of animal bones, apparently mainly deer, were found 
                    in the midden. Unfortunately, the archeologists did not save 
                    the animal bones, other than the bone tools, as was typical practice at the time. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Feature 1 deposits may represent a <strong>fire temple</strong>, 
                    similar to those described a few centuries later by the Spanish 
                    not far to the south among Hasinai groups. The best evidence 
                    for this is the massive ash accumulation itself and the fact 
                    that the ash pile was purposefully sealed, as special buildings 
                    often were; however, the limited UT investigations did not identify any structures in Feature 1. The Hasinai fire temple was said to have a large 
                    central hearth, which was not the case here, but there is 
                    no reason at all to believe that each Caddo group built and 
                    arranged their fire temples the exact same way. </p>
                  <p class="text">The rich midden mound deposits with so many smashed pots, smoking 
                    pipes, and animal bones is exactly the kind of deposit we 
                    might expect at places where communal feasts were held. The 
                    Spanish noted that successful fall harvests occasioned major 
                    festivals at the principal villages that drew kinfolk and 
                    allies near and far for several-day celebrations of Caddo 
                    life. Such events would have involved feasting, special ceremonies, 
                    tobacco smoking, dancing, performances of stories and songs, 
                    trading, negotiating, courtship, and many other activities. 
                    Of course, we cannot say for certain that this is what took 
                    place at the A.C. Saunders site, but such an interpretation 
                    is consistent with what was found there.</p>

                  <p class="text"><strong>Mid-Ouachita</strong> and <strong>Social Hill phase</strong> 
                    sites in the Ouachita and Saline valleys of south-central 
                    Arkansas include specialized saltmaking communities such as 
                    the <strong>Hardman site</strong>. Excavations there under the direction 
                    of Ann Early uncovered evidence of a long-lived Late Caddo 
                    and protohistoric settlement including a fenced compound such 
                    as the one shown in the accompanying reconstruction. The Caddo 
                    people who lived at this site along Saline Bayou in the Ouachita 
                    River valley collected salt brine from natural seeps and boiled 
                    it down in heavy flat ceramic pans. The salt was probably 
                    traded mainly to non-Caddo corn farming peoples living in 
                    great numbers in the nearby valleys of the Mississippi and 
                    lower Arkansas rivers. People depending on maize (corn) for 
                    much of their diet would have required additional salt in 
                    their diet. Thus, it makes sense that all of the salt-making 
                    sites known in the Caddo Homeland date to relatively late 
                    times (Middle and Late Caddo periods) after corn became king.

                  <p class="text">The excavation of a large two-part platform 
                    mound dating to about A.D. 1300-1500 at the <strong>Ferguson site</strong> 
                    in the Little Missouri River drainage of southwest Arkansas 
                    exposed a series of temples and houses built in successive 
                    stages. Temples were erected at the higher south end of the 
                    150 by 70-foot Mound A and houses (perhaps of priests or leaders) 
                    at the north end. Excavations were done at the Ferguson site 
                    in the early 1970s by the Arkansas Archeological Survey with 
                    the assistance of the Arkansas Archaeological Society under 
                    the direction of Frank Schambach. The accompanying photographs 
                    show some of the extremely well preserved remains of ritually 
                    dismantled and burned temples. The Ferguson site spans the 
                    latter Middle Caddo and earlier Late Caddo periods. </p>

                    ranging in diameter from 6.4-12 m in diameter. This site also 
                    had a small cemetery with extended and flexed burials of children 
                    and adults. Funerary objects placed with the deceased included 
                    one to six ceramic vessels per individual, Perdiz arrowpoints, conch shell

                  <p class="text">The <strong>Titus phase</strong> (ca. A.D. 1430-1680) 
                    represents the archeological remains of related Caddo groups 
                    who lived between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the East 
                    Texas Pineywoods and Post Oak Savannah [see next section]. 
                    These Caddo peoples lived in dispersed year-round settlements 
                    where they farmed and hunted, buried their dead in planned 
                    cemeteries, and manufactured culturally distinctive ceramics 
                    of considerable stylistic and functional diversity. The same 
                    may be said for the contemporaneous Frankston phase groups 
                    in the Upper Neches and Angelina River basins, and Caddo groups 
                    living in the Angelina and Attoyac River basins.</p>

                    small-scale societies led by hereditary leaders and priests.  There 
                    are considerable archeological similarities in patterns of 
                    mound construction and burial practices among the Titus phase 
                    groups and the Belcher, McCurtain, and Texarkana phase groups 
                    along the Red River. Unfortunately, the Caddo groups in the 
                    Sabine and Cypress drainages were only cursorily described 
                    in early historic times before they disappeared, probably 
                    being absorbed into the well known Cadohadacho and Hasinai 
                    groups to the north, east, and south.</p>
