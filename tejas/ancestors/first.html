            <p class="text">The <strong>earliest peoples</strong> who lived in the area 
              that would become the Caddo Homeland were highly mobile hunters 
              and gatherers during the early <strong>Paleoindian era</strong> at the end 
              of the last ice age (Pleistocene), some 12,000-13,500 years ago 
              (10,000-11,500 B.C.). (A growing body of evidence suggests that people arrived in
              North America thousands of years earlier, but the earliest evidence is 
              debated.) Early Paleoindian points including the Clovis and Folsom 
              styles have been found in the area as have distinctive lanceolate 
              spear and dart points dating to later Paleoindian cultures. </p>
            <p class="text">By around 8,000 B.C. artifacts of the Dalton and San 
              Patrice cultures are particularly common in the Southeast, suggesting 
              that populations are growing and that different cultures were developing. 
              Within the Caddo Homeland, evidence of Dalton culture is found mainly 
              to the north, while that of San Patrice is mainly to the south. 
              Beyond the region, Dalton points are concentrated in the Mississippi 
              Valley and are especially numerous in northeast Arkansas. These 
              contrasting patterns may reflect an early split between ethnic/linguistic 
              groups. We do not know how this inferred split relates to later peoples. 
              </p>
            <p class="text">Dalton and San Patrice are considered by many archeologists 
              to be among the first of many <strong>Archaic cultures</strong> (or the latest Paleoindian groups) in the Southeastern 
              United States around 10,000 years ago, named for the distinctive dart points made by their 
              hunters.  The entire Archaic period spans 7,500 years between 
              roughly 8,000 B.C. and 500 B.C. The Archaic concept was originally 
              proposed as a developmental stage during which mobile hunting cultures 
              gradually became more settled and more reliant on wild plants, small 
              game, and aquatic resources. In the broad sense, this view remains 
              accurate, but we now realize that Archaic cultures were quite varied 
              and responsible for many of the cultural developments once thought 
              to date to the succeeding Woodland era. For example, permanent or 
              semi-permanent village settlements, pottery, horticulture (gardening), 
              artificial earthen mounds, and extensive, long-distant trade of 
              exotic materials all appeared during Archaic times in various places 
              in the Southeast. </p>
            <p class="text">While most of the seemingly more advanced Archaic cultures 
              are known from areas hundreds of miles to the east and northeast 
              of the Caddo area, some very important developments took place in 
              the lower Mississippi Valley immediately to the east and southeast. 
              For instance, in what is today northeastern Louisiana, <strong>Archaic 
              peoples began building large earthen mounds as early as 4,000 B.C</strong>. 
              These were not burial mounds, but apparently served as platforms 
              upon which people lived. At Watson Brake near Monroe, Louisiana, 
              11 mounds 3 to 25 feet (1-8 meters) tall are connected by ridges 
              to form an oval enclosure over 850 feet (261 meters) across. The 
              Archaic mounds of Louisiana are all located adjacent to now-abandoned 
              river channels and were built by hunting and gathering peoples who 
              exploited the local swampy environments rich in aquatic life including 
              fish, fowl, and beast. </p>
            <p class="text">In the same region around <strong>1700 B.C.</strong>, massive 
              earthworks were built at the site of <strong>Poverty Point</strong> by peoples 
              who depended on aquatic and riverine resources. The Poverty Point 
              earthworks included a huge bird-shaped mound more than 70 feet (21 
              m) high and 710 feet (216 m) in length and a unique C-shaped array 
              of raised berms arranged into six concentric and nested rings that 
              are nearly three-quarters of a mile across (3,950 feet or 1.2 km) 
              at the widest point. Poverty Point is thought by many experts to 
              have been the center of a precocious society with far-flung trade 
              connections as indicated by the finding of many artifacts made of 
              exotic or non-local stone (some coming from sources hundreds of 
              miles away). These exotic items may have been sent to Poverty Point 
              in exchange for shell beads and ornaments, produced at Poverty Point 
              and at linked sites on the Gulf coast. For reasons yet unclear Poverty 
              Point culture had declined by 1000 B.C. and left no obvious successor. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">As far as we now know, the later Archaic peoples living 
              in the Caddo Homeland did not build earthen mounds or form societies 
              comparable to the one responsible for Poverty Point. Late Archaic 
              groups in the region did participate at least indirectly in the 
              Poverty Point trade network. This is known because a variety of 
              artifacts have been found at Poverty Point that are made of materials 
              such as novaculite and quartz from the Ouachita Mountains. But Late 
              Archaic groups in the Caddo Homeland area seem to have been relatively 
              small societies who were not closely connected to the main areas 
              of the Eastern Woodlands where precocious developments were taking 
              place. </p>
            <p class="text">One such development was the beginning of plant domestication 
              and horticulture (gardening). In the past few decades archeologists 
              and ethnobotanists (specialists in how ancient peoples used plants) 
              have demonstrated that at least four plants were domesticated in 
              the Eastern Woodlands by 4,000 to 5,000 years ago (2000-3000 B.C.). 
              Through selective manipulation squash, sunflower, marsh elder, and 
              chenopodium (goosefoot) were all transformed from wild plants to 
              crop plants with larger seeds and other desirable characteristics. 
              The best evidence comes from only a few caves and open sites in 
              the American Midwest that have extraordinary preservation conditions. 
              The nearest one to the main Caddo Homeland is the Phillips Spring 
              site in the Ozark Plateau of southern Missouri, less than 300 miles 
              to the north of the Red River. Domesticated squash and bottle gourd 
              seeds found at Phillips Spring have been radiocarbon dated to at 
              least 5,000 years ago.</p>
            <p class="text">The discovery that these starchy and oily seed plants 
              were being cultivated in Middle and Late Archaic times has shattered 
              the traditional notion that the Archaic cultures of the Eastern 
              U.S. were purely hunters and gatherers. Clearly, Archaic peoples 
              were experimenting with plant cultivation and probably all sorts 
              of other manipulations of the natural environment such as selective 
              clearing, spreading desirable plants to new areas, and so on. Archeologists 
              are now reevaluating existing ideas about Archaic life.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Were the Late Archaic ancestors of the Caddo also 
              experimenting with gardening and growing starchy and oily seed plants?</strong> 
              We do not know. The view here is that it is very likely that some 
              Late Archaic groups in the Caddo Homeland area began experimenting 
              with planting seeds obtained through trade and exchange from peoples 
              to the north and northeast. But so far we do not have any &quot;smoking 
              gun&quot; evidence&#151;preserved domesticated seeds. This is at 
              least partly due to prevailing preservation conditions and the lack 
              of concerted effort to recover the needed evidence from Late Archaic sites. This is a prime 
              research issue in need of more work. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong>What do we know about Late Archaic peoples in the 
              Caddo Homeland?</strong> The Late Archaic period between roughly 3000-500
              B.C. in the Caddo Homeland remains rather poorly known. Isolated 
              and well-preserved Late Archaic site components (discrete deposits 
              from a single period or use episode) are uncommon and not many have 
              been studied. Nonetheless, Late Archaic-style dart points with expanding 
              and contracting stems including, among others, the Yarborough, Ellis, 
              and Edgewood types, are widely distributed throughout the area and, 
              at many sites, are more numerous than earlier styles. In much of 
              the region, Archaic lifeways seem to have persisted longer than 
              elsewhere in the Eastern Woodlands.</p>
            <p class="text">Compared to earlier periods, the Late Archaic seems 
              to have been a time of higher populations and of more intensive 
              use of the landscape&#151;sites are found on all landforms from 
              major river terraces to upland ridges and everything in between. 
              At some sites, particularly in valleys on the north side of the 
              Ouachita Mountains and in the Great Bend area of Red River, refuse 
              middens (essentially, kitchen trash dumps) begin to accumulate in 
              Late Archaic times. The best known is the Wister phase of the Wister 
              Valley in far eastern Oklahoma. There, &quot;black middens&quot; 
              began to form in Late Archaic times. The Fourche Maline culture, 
              in part, represents an intensification of this settlement pattern 
              during the succeeding Woodland period. The presence of places with 
              dense refuse accumulations in Late Archaic times suggests that people 
              were becoming less mobile and staying in certain highly favorable 
              localities for extended periods of time. </p>
            <p class="text">Another interesting observation is that Late Archaic 
              peoples were making extensive use of local stones to make tools. 
              Why is this interesting? Because, except in areas such as the Ouachita 
              Mountains, most of the local stones in the Caddo area are of poor 
              quality and occur in small cobbles that are ill-suited to make nicely 
              finished stone tools (such as dart points, knives, and wood-working 
              tools). For instance, in parts of east Texas a commonly used material 
              was fossilized or petrified wood. The fact that Late Archaic people were using 
              such materials suggests two things. First, that they were not traveling 
              far to find serviceable, if minimally so, raw materials. Second, 
              there was not much trade with peoples in other areas (such as the 
              Ouachitas or central Texas) who had access to plenty of high quality 
              material. </p>
            <p class="text">Late Archaic peoples in the area appear to have been 
              hunters and gatherers as before, depending on a wide variety of 
              mammals, fish, birds, seeds, nuts, berries, and roots. Deer was 
              the most important large game animal, but the bones of many different 
              critters are found in Late Archaic middens. There is some evidence 
              for increased emphasis on the gathering and processing of nuts&#151;especially 
              hickory. While hickory nuts are tough nuts to crack, their oily 
              meats are both flavorful and an important source of fat and protein. 
              Evidence for the increased reliance on hickory comes from the large 
              number of &quot;nutting stones&quot; (stones with small pitted cups 
              that held hickory nuts securely during cracking) and the frequent 
              recovery of charred nut hulls in Late Archaic sites. To extract 
              all the fat, the cracked hickory nuts were probably stone boiled 
              by dropping hot rocks into a nut and water slurry in tightly woven 
              baskets or skin pouches, and the fat is skimmed off the top. </p>
            <p class="text">In the Cypress Creek basin in northeast Texas evidence 
              has also been found for the use of roots&#151;underground tubers 
              of the <em>Psoralea</em> family (common names include scurfy pea, 
              prairie turnip, and breadroot). Preparing tubers for eating is a 
              labor-intensive process. They had to be located, dug up, baked or 
              boiled, and then dried (or eaten immediately). The two advantages 
              of tubers are that they are available when nothing else is and that 
              they can be dried and stored for later use.</p>
            <p class="text">Putting all this together, across the Caddo Homeland 
              area we see evidence of people settling down into localized territories 
              and intensively using local resources, even those that were not 
              particularly desirable. This suggests that regional population levels 
              were high enough that there were no large unoccupied territories 
              into which people could easily move in tough times. People started 
              staying put or staying in smaller territories because their options 
              were limited. While we cannot point to any one Late Archaic site 
              and say with certainty, &quot;This is where ancestors of the Caddo 
              lived,&quot; we have little doubt that Caddo ancestors were already 
              living in what would become their homeland. We also think that the 
              conditions were set for the cultural developments that were to take 
              place in the succeeding Woodland period.</p>
