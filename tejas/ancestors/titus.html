                    lived between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the East Texas 
                    Pineywoods between about A.D. 1430-1680 are known as the Titus 
                    phase. Of the several hundred identified sites with Titus 
                    phase occupations, the largest concentration occurs in the 
                    Cypress Bayou (or Big Cypress Creek) Valley. Other Titus phase 
                    sites are found throughout the valley of the Little Cypress 
                    Creek, the southmiddle portions of the Sulphur River basin, 
                    the middle and upper portions of the White Oak Creek drainage, 
                    and the upper and middle reaches of the Sabine River drainage. 
                    Closely related communities were present in the Toledo Bend 
                    area farther to the south along the Sabine River in Louisiana 
                    and Texas and probably represent a late movement of Titus 
                    phase people.</p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologist Pete Thurmond sees the Titus phase 
                    has being made up of four contemporaneous subclusters: the 
                    Three Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress 
                    Creek. In addition, Robert Turner has proposed early and late 
                    periods within the Titus phase based on design motif variations 
                    on Ripley Engraved carinated bowls and changes in vessel form. 
                    Combining both ideas, there are apparent geographical clusters 
                    within the Titus phase as well as noticeable changes through 
                    time. </p>
                  <p class="text">Thurman defined his subclusters based on differences 
                    in the design motifs found on the most common type of decorated 
                    Titus phase pottery, Ripley Engraved bowls, as well as differences 
                    in other shared pottery types, and the distribution of different 
                    arrow point styles across the area. He argues that the Titus 
                    phase subclusters represent separate tribes or subtribes similar 
                    to the named groups who made up the historically known Hasinai 
                    and Cadohadacho alliances. The overall Titus phase seems to 
                    represent the archeological remains of a series of tribes/groups 
                    banded together in an alliance analogous to, and at least 
                    partially contemporaneous, with that of the Hasinai to the 
                    south and the Kadohadacho to the northeast. </p>
                  <p class="text">In general, Late Caddo societies seem to have 
                    had a three-tier social/political hierarchy. At the top were 
                    civic-ritual centers that had platform (temple) mounds, burial 
                    mounds, and presumably the residences of principal leaders 
                    (caddis as well as the xinesi and lesser priests). The larger 
                    examples of these are found along the major stream valleys, 
                    such as the Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers, but smaller 
                    centers were also present in smaller drainages such as along 
                    Big Cypress Creek (Titus phase). Below the civic-ritual centers 
                    (in size and presumably status) were small mound centers that 
                    lacked burial mounds or large platform mounds. Instead they 
                    had small mounds that capped burned and ritually dismantled 
                    structures functionally equivalent to those found on the platform 
                    (temple) mounds at the larger centers. At the bottom of the 
                    social ladder were small but widely distributed rural communities 
                    made up of many farmsteads and hamlets often spread out along 
                    smaller streams and across productive upland areas.</p>
                  <p class="text">For the Titus phase, Thurmond recognized three 
                    types/sizes of settlements: limited use areas, small settlements, 
                    and large settlements. The limited use areas are places that 
                    were used only in certain seasons for short-term stays such 
                    as camps for hunting, nut-gathering, and salt-making. In contrast, 
                    the small and large settlements were occupied year-round. 
                    Small settlements (between 0.2-1.8 hectares or 0.5-4.5 acres 
                    in size) account for 73 percentage of the known Titus phase settlements 
                    in the Cypress Creek basin, the limited use areas 23 percentage, and 
                    the large settlements (those larger than 1.8 hectare or 4.5 
                    acres) only 4 percentage of the sample. </p>
                  <p class="text">One of the more intensively investigated large 
                    Titus phase settlements is the Pilgrim's Pride site along 
                    Big Cypress Creek at its confluence with Walkers Creek. Residential 
                    areas at the site cover between 5-10 acres, with more than 
                    100 pit features, several circular structures, midden deposits, 
                    and more than 20 burials, along with an open plaza-like area. 
                    Several of the burials appear to have been placed in and near 
                    the floors of structures, but the Pilgrim's Pride site also 
                    had a planned cemetery with at least 19 burials.</p>
                  <p class="text">The small settlements appear to have been home 
                    to one or several family compounds marked today by scattered 
                    house middens often containing daub (fired clay) and trash-heap 
                    (midden) mounds. Midden mounds up to one meter in height were 
                    common on Titus phase settlements before they began to be 
                    plowed in historic times. Excavations suggest that many activities 
                    occurred outside the houses, resulting in trash-filled pits, 
                    hearths, and posts in these areas, where ramadas and granaries 
                    may also have been present, along with concentrations of artifacts 
                    and debris. The limited evidence of structure rebuilding, 
                    suggests that most Titus phase settlements were occupied only 
                    about a generation. Small family cemeteries typically occurred 
                    nearby. </p>
                  <p class="text">Because of the intense avocational and professional 
                    and focus on the cemeteries that occur on Titus phase settlements, 
                    as well as significant looting of these sites since the early 
                    20th century, little is known about the types of houses and 
                    storage structures used by these groups. Based on the few 
                    houses that have been excavated (some of which were in mounds 
                    and probably are not ordinary domestic structures), houses 
                    were probably circular in shape, with wattle and daub walls 
                    (sometimes) and thatched roofs. They were between five and 
                    eight meters in diameter and some, especially those capped 
                    by mounds, have extended entranceways. Within the houses were 
                    central hearths and center posts, possible interior benches 
                    and racks for sleeping and storage, as well as storage and 
                    trash pits. Residential structures had some midden accumulation 
                    on their floors (i.e., house middens), which were not prepared 
                    or clay-lined, but the vast majority of the daily trash and 
                    refuse was deposited on the nearby trash midden mound.</p>
                  <p class="text">When Pedro Vial visited the Nadaco Caddo &quot;village&quot; 
                    near the Sabine River in 1788 (probably in the vicinity of 
                    Longview and Marshall, Texas), he described it as having thirteen 
                    to fifteen houses scattered over a distance of three leagues 
                    (about eight miles). The houses or ranchos of the Nadaco were 
                    evidently distributed mainly along tributaries of the Sabine 
                    River. The distribution of Titus phase settlements suggests 
                    that agricultural farmsteads and hamlets were scattered similarly 
                    in prehistoric times, usually being found near springs or 
                    along smaller streams, where good soil and fairly level ground 
                    for farming was present.</p>
                  <p class="text">The permanent settlements and larger cemeteries 
                    of the Titus phase tend to be found near springs. In contrast, 
                    Late Caddo mound centers typically do not occur in proximity 
                    to a spring, but rather are on the floodplains of major rivers 
                    and large creeks or they are situated on ridges that jut into 
                    and overlook large floodplains. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mound-building in the Late Caddo period in the 
                    Pineywoods outside of the Red River valley was once thought 
                    to have ceased between roughly A.D. 1400 and 1500, but dates 
                    from several sites in Upshur and Camp counties suggest mound-building 
                    may have continued in the Titus phase &quot;heartland&quot; 
                    until about A.D. 1600 or later. Only a modest number of Late 
                    Caddoan period mounds are known in the region, ranging from 
                    one to four small mounds per site. </p>
                  <p class="text">There are two types of cemeteries used by the 
                    Titus phase groups: the small family cemetery, and the large 
                    community cemetery. More than 130 Titus phase cemeteries have 
                    been documented to date. </p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>small family cemeteries</strong> contain roughly 
                    equal numbers of adult males and females and are located near 
                    farmsteads or hamlets. Such cemeteries in the western margins 
                    of the Titus phase area have about 10-20 individuals while 
                    those in the Titus &quot;heartland&quot; along Big Cypress 
                    bayou have 20-40 graves. There are few indications of differential 
                    status or social rank in grave good associations and burial 
                    treatment in family cemeteries. Typically, the graves are 
                    laid out in rows with the individuals in extended positions 
                    oriented roughly east-west. Children were typically buried 
                    in subfloor pits within the houses themselves. Artifact associations 
                    in family cemeteries seem to differ only by age and sex. Older 
                    individuals are buried with more offerings than younger ones. 
                    Men's graves often contain clusters of arrow points in patterns 
                    suggesting quivers of arrows. Women's graves contain polishing 
                    stones or more numerous pottery vessels. Items of exotic material 
                    are quite rare in family cemeteries.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>large community cemeteries</strong> of the 
                    Titus phase seem to have served several communities in the 
                    vicinity. These cemeteries usually contain at least 60-70 
                    individuals, but some are known that contained at least 150-300 
                    individuals. Large community cemeteries show the existence 
                    of different social classes within the Titus phase Caddo communities. 
                    Known community cemeteries are not uniformly distributed among 
                    the Titus phase groups, but are concentrated on Big Cypress 
                    Bayou and several of its eastward-flowing tributaries (i.e., 
                    Walkers Creek, Dry Creek, Greasy Creek, Meddlin Creek, and 
                    Arms Creek), the Titus phase &quot;heartland,&quot; with a 
                    few large cemeteries known on Little Cypress and White Oak 
                    creeks. Presumably, the areas where these larger cemeteries 
                    are found had the highest population densities and more complex 
                    societies.</p>
                  <p class="text">The larger community cemeteries are internally 
                    organized by space and structurally divided by rank. Graves 
                    rarely overlap and it looks like the cemeteries expanded over 
                    time. Since the cemetery plan was consistently maintained, 
                    they may reflect stable communities over several generations.</p>
                  <p class="text">Four criteria have been used to identify social 
                    status ranking in Titus phase cemeteries: the presence of 
                    large shaft tombs, the number of individuals per grave, the 
                    relative quantity of grave goods, and the presence of certain 
                    types of presumed high-status artifacts. Large shaft tombs 
                    and those with multiple interments are considered to be high-status 
                    burials; all other Titus phase burials are single, individual 
                    burials. Family cemeteries do not contain shaft tombs or multiple 
                    interments. The high status burials also contain larger numbers 
                    of grave offerings ( over 30 compared to an overall average 
                    of about 15 per grave) than those of other burials. There 
                    are also certain types of artifacts only found in high-status 
                    burials. For example, in the Cypress and Upper Sabine basins, 
                    large, thin chipped-stone knives are almost always found with 
                    high status adult males.</p>
                  <p class="text">There are 18 known Titus phase sites in the 
                    Pineywoods that have burials of presumed high-status individuals, 
                    such as J. E. Galt, Caldwell, Lower Peach Orchard, Tuck Carpenter, 
                    H. R. Taylor, and others; these are along Big Cypress Bayou 
                    and its tributaries, particularly in the Titus phase &quot;heartland&quot; 
                    between the dam site at Lake Bob Sandlin and the Lake O' the 
                    Pines dam, and western and southern tributaries such as Dry 
                    Creek, Greasy Creek, and Arms Creek. Other cemeteries with 
                    high rank burials occur in the Little Cypress Creek valley, 
                    along a Sabine River tributary, and on White Oak Bayou. The 
                    best-known and studied community cemeteries with high-status 
                    burials are the Tuck Carpenter and H. R. Taylor sites.</p>
                  <p class="text">At the <strong>Tuck Carpenter cemetery</strong>, high-status 
                    burials dating between ca. A.D. 1350-1550 are at the center 
                    of the 70+ interments in the cemetery, while the latest high-status 
                    burials (estimated to date after ca. A.D. 1550 to the early 
                    1600s) were placed near the outer edge of the cemetery. With 
                    the exception of the two graves with multiple interments, 
                    graves contained single individuals in extended position that 
                    were placed in the cemetery in roughly aligned north-south 
                    rows. The high-status burials contained on average 37 grave 
                    offerings per burial (large numbers of ceramic vessels and 
                    arrow points), compared to about 15 grave goods per burial 
                    for the cemetery as a whole.</p>
                  <p class="text">A similar pattern is seen in the graves in the 
                    cemetery at the <strong>H. R. Taylor site</strong>. Mean values of ceramic 
                    vessels (8.3 per individual), arrow points (5.09 per individual), 
                    and total number of specimens (14.5 per individual) as grave 
                    offerings at H. R. Taylor are not significantly different 
                    from other Titus phase cemeteries, but the high-status burials 
                    each contained between 27-55 grave offerings.</p>
                  <p class="text">High-status individuals account for 8 and 9 percentage 
                    of the burials at H. R. Taylor and Tuck Carpenter, respectively. 
                    Overall, in the Titus phase mortuary populations, high-status 
                    individuals account for less than 2 percentage of all known burials, 
                    showing that the community cemeteries were associated with 
                    the mound centers where the leading members of the Titus phase 
                    societies presumably lived. In contrast, lower-status interments, 
                    namely those lacking grave goods or containing only small 
                    quantities (0 to 9.0 items at Tuck Carpenter and 0 to 6.7 
                    items at H. R. Taylor), account for 19 percentage and 23 percentage of the burials 
                    at the two sites, respectively. As judged by the grave goods, 
                    lower-status individuals at both these community cemeteries 
                    were usually adult females, juveniles, or children. Most of 
                    the individuals at both cemeteries, 73 percentage at H.R. Taylor and 
                    68 percentage at Tuck Carpenter, fall within the middle category of 
                    neither high nor low status.</p>
                  <p class="text">The majority of known Titus phase burials of 
                    apparent high-status appear to date after ca. A.D. 1550-1600. 
                    Those individuals buried prior to A.D. 1550 demonstrate considerable 
                    intra-regional variability in the manner of burial treatment, 
                    as well as in the types of grave offerings. For example, in 
                    addition to the multiple interments at Tuck Carpenter, shaft 
                    tombs are represented in a pre-A.D. 1550 cemetery at the Lower 
                    Peach Orchard site. At the J. E. Galt site, the high-status 
                    burial included such offerings as a large number of celt fragments 
                    and other native stone implements, rather than caches of arrow 
                    points. Galt bifaces were also recovered from the cemetery.</p>
                  <p class="text">In general, community cemeteries are relatively 
                    short-lived phenomena that were used intensively in the core 
                    Titus phase area in the basin of Big Cypress Creek after about 
                    A.D. 1550 to the early 1600s. It is probably no coincidence 
                    that the period of the most intensive use of community cemeteries 
                    seems to be roughly contemporaneously with the initial contact 
                    between Titus phase Caddo populations and the Spanish De Soto/Moscoso 
                    entrada of 1542-1543. The short-term use of these cemeteries 
                    could, in part, reflect deaths due to conflicts with the Spanish 
                    army as well as increased mortality from European diseases. 
                    The timing in the intensification of the use of large community 
                    cemeteries in the region also seems to occur at about the 
                    same time that mound centers ceased to be used for community 
                    ritual and religious functions by about the 1550s or slightly 
                    later. Collectively, the changes occurring after 1550 reflect 
                    rapidly changing societies on the eve of (or in the process 
                    of) group consolidation and the eventual Caddo abandonment 
                    of the Pineywoods of northeast Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">One of the most striking aspects of the Titus 
                    phase archeological record is the diversity and distinctiveness 
                    of the pottery found in settlements and cemeteries. The wide 
                    variety of vessel shapes and decorations, as well as their 
                    frequency in domestic contexts, demonstrates the importance 
                    of pottery for cooking and serving food, as personal possessions, 
                    and as social identifiers. Large quantities of both fine wares 
                    and utility wares were manufactured in the Titus phase. </p>
                  <p class="text">The fine wares were tempered with finely crushed 
                    grog (pottery) and bone, and were well-polished; shell-tempered 
                    vessels are quite rare, and when found, are typically trade 
                    wares from the Red River Caddo. Titus fine ware was decorated 
                    with engraved lines, with scrolls, scrolls and circles, pendant 
                    triangles, and other curvilinear motifs. Another form of decoration 
                    was the application of a red hematite (ochre) slip on both 
                    interior and exterior surfaces, and the painting of engraved 
                    lines with red hematite or white kaolin. The diversity of 
                    vessel forms is impressive: carinated bowls, compound bowls, 
                    bottles, cone-shaped bowls, ollas, jars with flaring rims, 
                    square bowls, globular peaked jars, and chalices. Animal effigies 
                    and rattle bowls were also made.</p>
                  <p class="text">The utility vessels were tempered with grog 
                    and grit (crushed stone such as sandstone and hematite), and 
                    had a coarser paste along with a thicker body. Small to large 
                    jars (over 30 centimeters or 12 inches in height with mouth 
                    diameters greater than 25-30 cm) and plain conical bowls were 
                    typical utility vessel shapes. The presence of carbon encrustations, 
                    food residues, and sooting on many of the utility vessels 
                    show clearly that these were cooking pots. The larger utility 
                    vessels were probably mainly used for storage of food (wide/flaring 
                    mouths) and liquids (narrow/constricted mouths).</p>
                  <p class="text">Utility vessels were decorated and textured 
                    with neck-banding, brushing, applique, incising, punctating, 
                    and various combinations thereof. Small handles or lugs were 
                    added to some utility vessels. Utility vessels probably comprised 
                    between 50 to 70 percentage of the ceramic assemblages in Titus phase 
                    settlements. Far fewer utility vessels, proportionally, are 
                    found in Titus phase cemeteries.</p>
                  <p class="text">Titus phase groups also made ceramic earspools, 
                    as well as tubular and elbow pipes of clay. Earspools were 
                    also made from siltstone and sandstone, as well as wood. One 
                    set of earspools from the Tuck Carpenter site had been covered 
                    with sheet copper. The elbow pipes are commonly decorated 
                    with engraved lines that have been painted (filled) with red 
                    hematite or white kaolin clay.</p>
                  <p class="text">Compared to earlier periods, stone tools and 
                    tool-making debris are generally uncommon at Late Caddo period 
                    sites in the Pineywoods. We suspect this is because many tools 
                    were made out of wood, cane, bone, and shell, few examples 
                    of which are preserved in the archeological record. The relatively 
                    few stone tools types present also indicate the increased 
                    importance of other materials at the expense of stone. Common 
                    stone tools include triangular and corner-notched arrow points, 
                    flake tools (drills, scrapers, and retouched pieces), along 
                    with an array of groundstone implements. These include celts, 
                    metates and manos, battered and polished cobbles and pebbles, 
                    hematite and limonite pigment stones, and abrading slabs.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although bone is usually poorly preserved in 
                    Titus phase sites, many different kinds of bone tools have 
                    been found in favorable contexts. Among these are deer-mandible 
                    cutting tools, deer beamers (hide-working tools), deer ulna 
                    punches, antler-tine flaking tools, and deer and bird bone 
                    pins. Turtle carapace rattles have also been found. Heavy 
                    clam shell digging tools (&quot;hoes&quot;) are sometimes 
                    present. </p>
                  <p class="text">Unfortunately, few studies have been done of 
                    the diet of Titus phase groups based on charred plant and 
                    animal remains, which are sometimes reasonably well preserved 
                    in middens, hearths, and pit features. Charred plant remains 
                    from trash midden deposits suggests that corn (Zea mays L.) 
                    was the main dietary staple, but that beans (<em>Phaseolus 
                    vulgaris</em>) were also an important food source. Nuts and 
                    seeds were still gathered, but of lesser importance in the 
                    Titus phase than they were between ca. A.D. 900-1400. In fact, 
                    evidence from the Titus phase in the Pineywoods, as well as 
                    elsewhere in the Caddo area, suggests that the Late Caddo 
                    economy was based primarily on maize (corn).</p>
                  <p class="text">Animal bones identified in Titus phase trash 
                    middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, 
                    squirrel, and beaver. Turtle and fish were also present, but 
                    were relatively uncommon compared to mammals and birds. Deer 
                    and turkey appear to have been the main prey species.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although many of the details are not yet understood, 
                    grave goods and other exotic artifacts (such as marine whelk/conch 
                    shell and certain stones) suggest that trade among &quot;town 
                    and country&quot; Caddo communities and among Caddo groups 
                    in different areas was flourishing at the time of initial 
                    European contact in the sixteenth century. Titus phase people 
                    were also part of long-distance trade and information networks 
                    linking Caddo groups with farming peoples living in the Southwest, 
                    Southern Plains, and lower Mississippi Valley.</p>
                  <p class="text">The most common ceramic imports found in Titus 
                    phase sites are those from the Red River Caddo groups. They 
                    include such fine wares as Belcher Ridged, Belcher Engraved, 
                    Glassell Engraved, and Hodges Engraved from the Belcher phase 
                    to the east, and shell-tempered Avery Engraved and Simms Engraved 
                    pottery types of the McCurtain and Texarkana phases to the 
                    north some 100 kilometers (62 miles). Red River gravel chert 
                    (flint) and chalcedony was found to make up about 20 percentage of the 
                    stone tools and debris in the Three Basin subcluster of the 
                    Titus phase. Hatton tuff and siliceous shales from the Ouachita 
                    Mountains were used to make celts. Edwards chert from central 
                    Texas is also found in Titus phase sites, showing the existence 
                    of trade and exchange with non-Caddoan hunting and gathering 
                    peoples living more than 150 kilometers (93 miles) to the 
                    west and southwest of the Pineywoods Caddo. </p>
                  <p class="text">New assessments of the route of the de Soto-Moscoso 
                    1542-1543 entrada through East Texas suggest that the Spanish 
                    encountered the Titus phase peoples described by the chroniclers 
                    as the Lacane province. By 100-150 years later, the Titus 
                    area had been virtually abandoned. The demise of the Titus 
                    phase people is thought to be mainly due to the introduction 
                    and, more importantly, the continued exposure of Caddo groups 
                    to European epidemic diseases. It is likely that some Titus 
                    phase peoples moved to live with either the Red River Kadohadacho, 
                    or among the Hasinai Caddo south of the Sabine River.</p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists believe that Titus phase Caddo 
                    sites in the Pineywoods hold great promise in helping to document 
                    the nature of social, political, demographic, and economic 
                    changes in the region during a most eventful era in Caddo 
                    history. In part this is because improved dating now makes 
                    it possible to use subtle pottery differences to pin down 
                    the date of some sites and events (such as graves) to perhaps 
                    within a 20- to 30-year period. As other studies of Caddo 
                    archeology make clear, there have been substantial changes 
                    in Caddo societies from ca. A.D. 800 to European contact. 
                    One of the most important changes is the development and elaboration 
                    of complicated forms of social and political organization 
                    after ca. A.D. 1400 in many regions of the Caddo Homeland.</p>
