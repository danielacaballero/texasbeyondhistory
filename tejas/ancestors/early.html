                    begins to emerge on the western frontier of the Southeastern 
                    culture area as a unique and early expression of the larger

                    in many other areas of the Eastern Woodlands, but not necessarily 
                    at the same time and in the same ways. The Mississippian world 
                    was a mosaic of cultural traditions sharing, to varying degrees, 
                    what we might call common &quot;themes.&quot; These overlapping 
                    themes include maize agriculture, settled life, elaborate 
                    ritual life, ranked societies, mound-building, ancestor veneration, 
                    ritual/political centers, long-distance exchange, warfare, 
                    competition, effective methods of food gathering, hunting, 
                    processing, and storage, and sophisticated craft production. 
                    Such themes were shared mainly through the exchange of ideas 
                    and things from group to group rather than through migration. 
                    In this section we look at how these themes were expressed 
                    in the Caddo world. </p>
                  <p class="text">Here, we use the term &quot;<strong>Emerging Caddo</strong>&quot; 
                    to refer to the 200-year period between A.D. 800-1000 when 
                    the Caddo cultural tradition emerges from its Late Woodland 
                    origins; the term Formative Caddo is often used for this period. We use &quot;<strong>Early Caddo</strong>&quot; to refer to 
                    the succeeding 200 years (A.D.1000-1200), when the Caddo archeological 
                    tradition is in evidence across the Caddo world. We will also 
                    use the lower-case &quot;early&quot; Caddo to refer to the 
                    combined 400-year-long era (A.D. 800-1200). Keep in mind that 
                    these archeological concepts and periods are standardized 
                    approximations of developments that, collectively, unfolded 
                    over at least 16 generations. Much of what happened during 
                    the 400-year development of early Caddo society is not very 
                    well understood for two interrelated reasons: not enough investigation 
                    and too few radiocarbon dates from key investigated sites. </p>
                  <p class="text">Only a few Emerging and Early Caddo sites have 
                    been excavated in East Texas and, of these, only the George C. Davis site 
                    has seen extensive scientific investigation. 
                    Most of the excavators of early Caddo sites have concentrated 
                    on burial mounds, yielding fascinating, but one-dimensional 
                    information. While we now know quite a bit about how elite 
                    members of early Caddo society were treated in death, we have 
                    little concrete understanding of their roles in life. And 
                    we know even less about the lives of ordinary people. There 
                    are good reasons to suspect that early Caddo society was quite 
                    different in some respects than the Caddo society known from 
                    early historic accounts. Few societies remain unchanged for 
                    eight centuries. </p>
                  <p class="text">The second, companion problem is that we have 
                    comparatively few radiocarbon dates from secure contexts and 
                    even fewer sequences of dated occupations at early Caddo sites. 
                    As a result, the timing of the emergence and development of 
                    early Caddo culture is unclear. Based on our reading of the 
                    data, Emerging Caddo culture dates at least as early as the 
                    mid 9th century (ca. A.D. 850) and perhaps a half-century 
                    earlier. At the time, a Caddo group related to peoples 
                    living along the Red River in extreme northwestern Louisiana 
                    established a new community near the Neches River 
                    on what became the southwestern frontier of the Caddo Homeland 
                    in the Piney Woods of east Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">This community, known to archeologists as the 
                    <strong>George C. Davis site</strong>, consisted of a village and a 
                    ritual center marked by three earthen mounds. Since this is 
                    the best known of the early Caddo sites in the main Caddo 
                    Homeland, we will discuss it in some detail, but in doing 
                    so we do not want to give the impression that all early Caddo 
                    sites were like the Davis site or that it is the earliest 
                    identifiably Caddo site. Neither impression rings true.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Davis site looks like it was established 
                    anew, as if its founders set up a new community based on ideas and experience 
                    gained elsewhere. For this reason we think that the Davis 
                    site cannot have been the first recognizably Caddo community 
                    and that somewhere to the northeast, perhaps along the Sabine 
                    or, more likely, on the Red River are even earlier Caddo communities 
                    that represent the true emergence of the diverse Caddo tradition. 
                    It is possible, we suppose, that the founders of the Davis 
                    site were one of the earliest groups to develop what we see 
                    today as early Caddo culture. In such a scenario, splinter 
                    groups (colonies) bent on breaking from tradition and following 
                    new ideas (reflecting differing religious and political/organizational 
                    wonts) may have moved to the western frontier&#151;the Piney 
                    Woods of east Texas. We could settle this question (and quite 
                    a few others) with a much larger set of well-dated early Caddo 
                    sites.</p>
                  <h3>Crenshaw Site </h3>
                  <p class="text">The Crenshaw site on the north side of the Red 
                    River in Miller County, Arkansas (and, more generally, the 
                    Great Bend area) is a prime candidate as one of the key places 
                    where the Caddo cultural tradition developed. This mound center 
                    on an old channel of the Red River has yielded a wealth of 
                    late Fourche Maline and early Caddo artifacts, graves, and 
                    architectural features. Many excavators have worked at the 
                    site beginning with C.B. Moore in 1912. Unfortunately, most 
                    of the digging since then was done by looters or by minimally 
                    trained amateur archeologists. Trained professional archeologists, 
                    most notably <strong>Frank Schambach</strong> of the Arkansas Archeological 
                    Survey in the late 1960s and early 1970s, have investigated 
                    small parts of the site. </p>
                  <p class="text">Crenshaw is a very complex site with a long 
                    history, but most of the dating is educated guesswork because 
                    so much of what is known comes from looters and early digging. 
                    Besides that, the Crenshaw site is mighty &#133; peculiar, 
                    for lack of a better way to put it. Beginning in Late Fourche 
                    Maline times, roughly A.D. 600-900, the site was used as a 
                    burial ground and ceremonial center, a place where mass burials 
                    and rituals took place, some being unknown elsewhere in the 
                    Caddo Homelands. Sometime after A.D. 900 people with a recognizable 
                    Caddo culture (possibly the direct descendants of the Fourche 
                    Maline people who used the site earlier) began using the Crenshaw 
                    site as a ceremonial center, adding some bizarre twists of 
                    their own. While part of the reason that the Crenshaw site 
                    looks peculiar is because we have not yet examined very many 
                    contemporary sites, the site may well have a uniquely important 
                    place in Caddo history. Here are a few examples of the seemingly 
                    unusual ritual practices we are talking about.</p>
                  <p class="text">In late Fourche Maline times, isolated human 
                    skulls and isolated mandibles (jaws) were placed on low earthen 
                    platforms and then covered over, forming a burial mound. Some 
                    skulls and jaws were accompanied by a few grave goods such 
                    as pots and beads, but most were not. Schambach thinks the 
                    bodies were buried elsewhere, perhaps at outlying villages, 
                    and that the heads and jaws were kept in charnel houses or 
                    on scaffolds until time came to bury them at the ritual center 
                    of Crenshaw. Hundreds of years later, between about A.D. 1250-1400, Caddo 
                    people placed numerous small groups of skulls and mandibles 
                    in small pits within a large open area at Crenshaw that is 
                    known as the Plaza of the Skulls. While a few pits containing 
                    isolated skulls reportedly have been found at at least one 
                    other Caddo site, the Crenshaw site may have been the focus 
                    of some sort of cult that involved the handling and burial 
                    of skulls, sometimes weathered and defleshed, sometimes freshly 
                    severed heads. Nothing like this is known from historic accounts 
                    in the Caddo area.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Crenshaw site also has a number of mass 
                    graves dating to the late Fourche Maline and possibly the 
                    Emerging Caddo periods. Three of the mass graves have rows 
                    of intact skeletons (10, 27, and 43 individuals) that were 
                    laid neatly, one against the next, on a mound surface that 
                    was then covered with a new layer of earth. Still other mass 
                    graves were rectangular pits with rows of bodies neatly laid 
                    side-by-side. Another mass grave is a circular pit about 50-feet 
                    across into which over 60 individuals were placed. Some were 
                    intact and completely articulated, suggesting that the deceased 
                    were placed in the pit soon after death. Other skeletons were 
                    weathered and jumbled, suggesting that these had been processed 
                    in a charnel house and brought to the pit in bundles. The 
                    pit was then covered with a thin layer of soil, atop which 
                    a large fire was built and a feast was held, judging from 
                    the large number of broken animal bones. These remains were 
                    then covered quickly by a large earthen mound. Once again, 
                    nothing like these behaviors is known from historic accounts 
                    of Caddo life.</p>
                  <p class="text">A final example of fascinating but unique early 
                    Caddo behavior at the Crenshaw site is a set of features dubbed 
                    the &quot;Antler Temple&quot; and an associated refuse pile 
                    containing the antlers and frontal skull sections of over 
                    1000 white-tailed deer. Schambach thinks the inferred temple 
                    dates to early Caddo times and might have been the residence 
                    of a shaman or priest, similar to the Hasinai fire temples 
                    documented in early Spanish accounts. (While no postholes 
                    or other direct structural evidence was detected, the debris 
                    patterns suggest that a structure had been present.) The finding 
                    of human teeth on the apparent temple floor suggests that 
                    human skulls and mandibles may have been stored in the temple 
                    prior to burial in the nearby Plaza of Skulls. (New radiocarbon dates published in 2016 indicate the adjoining ash bed structure or temple dates from about A.D. 1160-1250.) Schambach notes 
                    that Spanish accounts also describe successful Hasinai hunters 
                    bringing their deer to the <em>caddi</em> (Caddo leader) for blessing 
                    and ritual skinning. Deer heads were apparently part of the 
                    rituals. While the Antler Temple seems to represent a relatively early 
                    example of ritual practices still present among historic Caddo 
                    groups some 700 years later, it is still unique among known 
                    Caddo groups.</p>
                  <p class="text">Crenshaw may seem so peculiar simply because, 
                    fortuitously, the evidence there, particularly bone, is well 
                    preserved by thick layers of slackwater mud deposited when 
                    timber log jams on the nearby Red River formed and flooded 
                    low valley areas. In contrast, very little bone is preserved 
                    at the Davis site, which remained high and dry throughout 
                    its history. Nevertheless, Crenshaw seems to be a very atypical 
                    site with a special place in Caddo history. Schambach thinks 
                    that during early Caddo times that the site was a vacant ceremonial 
                    center where only a few priests and attendants lived. In this 
                    scenario, the ritual center would have served outlying communities 
                    presumably living in nearby villages and hamlets. Given the 
                    recent recognition, discussed below, that numerous hard-to-recognize 
                    house patterns occur around and between the mounds at the 
                    Davis site, the vacant ceremonial center notion is open to 
                    question. The same mud deposits that provide good preservation 
                    conditions at Crenshaw may yet conceal an early Caddo village. 
                    For now Crenshaw must be regarded as an unusual but highly 
                    important early Caddo site that needs further work and a solid 
                    radiocarbon chronology before its role in the development 
                    of early Caddo society can be fully understood.</p>
                  <h3>Davis Site </h3>
                  <p class="text">The George C. Davis site in the Neches River 
                    valley in east Texas has long played a central role in our 
                    understanding of early Caddo history. Much of this site in 
                    Cherokee County, Texas is now protected by Caddoan Mounds 
                    State Historic Site and can be visited by the public. The 
                    Davis site's importance is an accident of the history of archeological 
                    investigation more than it is a reflection of the site's actual 
                    role in Caddo history. There are other early Caddo mound centers 
                    that are larger than Davis and located in more central parts 
                    of the Caddo Homeland, such as along the Red River and the Sabine River. But no 
                    other site has had as great an impact on what we know about 
                    the ancient Caddo. Because of its importance, the George C. 
                    Davis site deserved to be the subject of a future major exhibit on 
                    Texas Beyond History. In the meantime, we provide a brief 
                    summary of some of the most important aspects of the site, 
                    beginning with a short history of its investigation.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>History of Investigations </strong></p>
                  <p class="text">In 1939 the Davis site was chosen for major 
                    excavation by the University of Texas at Austin for a WPA 
                    project, in part because it was the nearest major Caddo site 
                    to Austin and because there were many unemployed men in Cherokee 
                    County who needed work. Over the next 18 months a sizable 
                    WPA work crew excavated about half of the site's largest mound 
                    (Mound A) and its surrounds under the leadership of <strong>Perry Newell</strong>, 
                    an excellent field archeologist and meticulous recorder. Newell 
                    and his crew uncovered the often-overlapping outlines of an 
                    amazing series of large houses and special buildings around, 
                    beneath, and within the mound. </p>
                  <p class="text">During and just after World War II an extraordinary 
                    scholar, <strong>Alex D. Krieger</strong>, analyzed the artifacts from 
                    Davis and compared them to materials from dozens of Caddo 
                    sites in Texas and adjacent sites. He worked out the long 
                    sequence of Caddo prehistory and demonstrated that the Davis 
                    site dated long before the historic period. The resulting 
                    1949 report by Newell and Krieger provided the first truly 
                    detailed description of a major early Caddo center coupled 
                    with a bold interpretive framework that provided the first 
                    synthesis of early Caddo history. It is still regarded as 
                    a classic archeological site report.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1968, <strong>Dee Ann Story</strong>, professor of 
                    anthropology at UT Austin, took up the Davis site where Newell 
                    and Krieger left off. Over a three-year period Story's team 
                    excavated major parts of the remaining two mounds at Davis 
                    and investigated a number of other features at the site. Mound 
                    C proved to be, as Krieger suspected, a burial mound that 
                    contained a series of large tombs placed in deep pits. Mound 
                    B, the site's smallest and lowest mound, was found to have 
                    been a capping mound build over the foundations of at least 
                    one large, dismantled, special-purpose building and a platform 
                    upon which additional special buildings may have been built. 
                    In succeeding years during the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
                    Story returned to the Davis site with undergraduate and graduate 
                    students and carried out off-mound investigations in many 
                    areas of the site. One critical aspect of her work is that 
                    she obtained over 125 radiocarbon assays, making the Davis 
                    site the best-dated of all Caddo sites. The many scholarly 
                    articles, theses, and dissertations that resulted from Story's 
                    investigation made the Davis site that much more famous and 
                    important.</p>
                  <p class="text">The third era of investigation at the 
                    Davis site began in the early 2000s has begun under a new generation of researchers 
                    at UT Austin. Darrell G. Creel, then director of TARL, and Samuel 
                    Wilson, then professor of anthropology, directed new work 
                    at the site using state-of-the-art geophysical survey equipment. 
                    A device that senses subtle changes in the earth's magnetic 
                    field was used to create a new map of the site. This 
                    magnetic map revealed the existence of dozens of previously 
                    unseen structural patterns representing houses, special buildings, 
                    and various other features. This work gives us a much more 
                    complete look at the Caddo community that called the Davis 
                    site home for centuries.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Community Layout </strong></p>
                  <p class="text">The Davis site occupies a sizable area of a 
                    flat-topped river terrace remnant created long ago by the 
                    Neches River, which flows south to the Texas coast. For thousands 
                    of years prior to the arrival of the first Caddo group, hunting 
                    and gathering peoples (including those of the Mossy Grove 
                    culture) had camped in the vicinity from time to time, leaving 
                    behind stone tools and meager traces. Sometime in the mid 
                    to late 9th century, Caddo peoples established a community that was 
                    to last for some 400-450 years. Through time the community 
                    grew to perhaps 250-300 people and covered an area of about 
                    60 acres (roughly 600 x 900 meters or 2000 x 2900 feet), within 
                    which three large earthen mounds were constructed. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today the three mounds are the only visible 
                    reminders of the community of ancestral Caddo people whose 
                    houses, granaries, temples, dance grounds, and fields once 
                    covered much of the Davis site. While we would love to be 
                    able to hop into a time machine and visit the Caddo community 
                    in its prime some 800-900 years ago (and at various other 
                    points in its history), we cannot. The artists' depictions 
                    that accompany this exhibit give us good ideas of what the 
                    community may have looked like. Artists Nola Davis and George 
                    Nelson based their paintings on archeological details, early 
                    historic accounts of Caddo life, and educated guesswork. Using 
                    a similar approach, we can try to paint a word picture of 
                    the ancient Caddo community at its prime.</p>
                  <p class="text">Around A.D. 1100, only two of the mounds existed. 
                    <strong>Mound A</strong> was the focal point of what Dee Ann Story has 
                    called an &quot;inner precinct.&quot; Upon and around the 
                    mound were a series of large public buildings 12-16 meters 
                    (40-53 feet) in diameter that probably served as temples, 
                    council or clan houses, and perhaps the residences of the 
                    community's leader(s). Also in this inner precinct were several 
                    buildings with unusual floor plans that differed from the 
                    ordinary circular pattern as well as several very small structures 
                    that may represent granaries. Open areas within the inner precinct 
                    are probably small plazas perhaps used during ritual gatherings 
                    and dances. Just outside the inner precinct was a village 
                    area where smaller, ordinary houses (9-12 meters in diameter) 
                    had been built and rebuilt in the same area for generations. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Five hundred meters north of Mound A was a special 
                    cemetery marked by <strong>Mound C</strong>. Within and beneath the 
                    mound were several dozen tombs containing the bodies of community 
                    leaders, some of whom appear to have been accompanied by retainers 
                    or individuals sacrificed for the occasion. It is likely that 
                    only select individuals living in the inner precincts were 
                    interred in the special cemetery. As far as is known, there 
                    were no houses built near Mound C.</p>
                  <p class="text">Later in the site's history, a second, smaller 
                    precinct began forming 300 yards north of Mound A with the 
                    building of the site's largest known building, a circular 
                    structure some 18 meters (59 feet) across, and probably several 
                    other buildings. This building was dismantled at the end of 
                    its life, burned, and then capped by <strong>Mound B </strong>and additional 
                    structures may have been built atop the mound. Not enough 
                    excavation has been done in the area to be able to determine 
                    much else about this second inner precinct. </p>
                  <p class="text">The houses of many ordinary villagers were probably 
                    scattered across the areas between the mounds and outside 
                    them, presumably surrounded by garden areas where corn and 
                    other crops were grown. Outside work areas would have also 
                    been associated with this &quot;outer village.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">The community sketch just given is based mainly 
                    on what is known about the 10% of the Davis site that has 
                    been excavated, leaving us to fill the other 90% largely by 
                    conjecture and the results of geophysical surveys. Community reconstruction is also greatly hampered 
                    by the difficulty of precisely dating the various known structures, 
                    many of which were excavated by the WPA before radiocarbon 
                    dating was invented.</p>
                  <p class="text">These same difficulties are faced by archeologists 
                    trying to interpret any ancestral Caddo site; for most, far 
                    less is known than is the case for the Davis site. Happily, 
                    modern technology has recently been applied to the Davis site 
                    with very encouraging results. The maps below show the magnetic 
                    patterns detected in one area of the Davis site within an 
                    open area that had seen little previous investigation. Clear 
                    structural patterns are visible as well as a number of suggestive 
                    but as-yet unclear patterns. Test excavations in 
                    2003 confirmed that the structural pattern outlined in red 
                    on the map on the right is indeed that of a large building 
                    with a central hearth and four central posts that served as 
                    roof supports. </p>

                    </strong></p>
                  <p class="text">The three earthen mounds at the Davis site are 
                    visible reminders of the Caddo community and of the generations 
                    of villagers for whom the site must have been the sacred center 
                    of their world. The mounds, which were built at different 
                    times during the site's history, served various functions, 
                    all of them important to the life of the community. Mounds 
                    A and B were begun as low &quot;capping&quot; mounds that 
                    purposefully covered (capped) the floors of dismantled temples 
                    and communal buildings (collectively, &quot;special buildings&quot;). 
                    Then the top of Mound A (and possibly that of Mound B) served 
                    as a platform upon which new special buildings were built. 
                    Platform or temple mounds are one of the hallmarks of Mississippian 
                    life. Burial mounds like Mound C had been around since early 
                    Woodland days if not before.</p>
                  <p class="text">Each earthen mound at Davis was built in stages, 
                    probably during short periods of time when the community pitched 
                    in for the common good. The villagers dug up the soil from 
                    areas below the low bluff that borders the wide, flat terrace 
                    upon which the site sits. A large depression left by one of 
                    the barrow pits where soil was removed can still be seen today 
                    after 800 years of gradual infilling. Basketload after basketload 
                    of soil was carried up the bluff, brought to the mound site, 
                    and dumped. This was not a casual process, but a very deliberate 
                    one done with care. Often the villagers selected layers of 
                    soil having differing colors or textures for particular mound 
                    construction layers, particularly in Mound C, the burial mound. 
                    There, it is clear that certain colors must have be chosen 
                    for their symbolic value. For example, a special green clay 
                    obtained elsewhere in the Neches Valley was used to cover 
                    certain of the shaft-like tombs that held the bodies of very 
                    special members of the community. While we cannnot  decipher 
                    the specific meanings of the soil colors chosen a thousand 
                    years ago, the patterning is clearly purposeful and must have 
                    had deep symbolic value. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mounds A and B mark the <strong> inner 
                    precincts</strong> within the Davis community, a pattern than began 
                    before the mounds were begun and one that continued for generations. 
                    Within these precincts stood tall and often spacious beehive-shaped 
                    wooden buildings with grass-thatched roofs that were larger 
                    than ordinary houses. Some were probably the houses of community 
                    leaders and their close kin. Others were temples where priests 
                    or shamans lived and kept sacred paraphernalia and conducted 
                    sacred rites. Still others were probably something like council 
                    houses where men gathered on solemn occasion to plot revenge 
                    or otherwise deal with crisis, as described by the Spanish 
                    many centuries later. Unfortunately, the Caddo rarely left 
                    many telltale clues as to what each building was used for. 
                    They kept the buildings (and probably much of the village) 
                    swept clean. And when an important building had served its 
                    purpose, it was very carefully dismantled, its timbers yanked, 
                    and everything above the floor was either burned on the spot 
                    or taken elsewhere for disposal (or reuse). This is why we 
                    use the purposefully vague term &quot;special buildings&quot; 
                    to characterize these imposing and obviously important buildings.</p>
                  <p class="text">At Davis several special buildings stand apart 
                    from all others because they are so unusual and so complicated. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Named the <strong>Ceremonial Maze</strong> by Perry Newell 
                    and, less prosaically, Feature 35, Building F35 was uncovered 
                    some 11 meters (36 feet) south of Mound A. Its outline is 
                    most curious, consisting basically of three concentric, discontinuous 
                    wall trenches, one of which was partially offset from the 
                    others. An apparent extended entranceway faced north and there 
                    was a hearth in the center of the building. Strangely, the 
                    innermost trenches and two of the exterior ones had no evidence 
                    of posts. All the other trenches had post hole patterns or the actual remains of burned posts.</p>
                  <p class="text">The two intersecting entranceway patterns on 
                    the north side are enigmatic. As described by Newell, they 
                    &quot;gave the impression that they might form an entranceway 
                    but the narrowness of the passageway between the posts makes 
                    this unlikely, although possible. The idea that they might 
                    have formed two entranceways for two successive structures 
                    seems unlikely as &#133; the uniformity of the whole patterns 
                    makes it appear a single unit.&quot; (From Newell and Krieger, 
                    1949.) </p>
                  <p class="text">We think it more likely that two building stages 
                    are represented and that the entranceway and perhaps other 
                    parts of the building were remodeled (and slightly reoriented) 
                    during its life. Regardless, Building F35 is probably some 
                    sort of religious temple, perhaps built in the shape of a 
                    bird. Bird-shaped buildings and mounds are known elsewhere 
                    in the Eastern Woodlands. Use your imagination and look at 
                    the plan map of this building. Think about a turkey, a favorite 
                    bird of the historic and the living Caddo peoples. The entranceway 
                    at the north is the bird's neck, its wings are spread east 
                    and west and its tail fans out to the south. Keep in mind 
                    that you are looking at only the foundation pattern. If this 
                    really was a bird-effigy temple, the roof, walls, and perhaps 
                    carved wooden sculptures would have fleshed out the design, 
                    so to speak. You might think this notion far-fetched, but 
                    Building F35 is most definitely a strange bird.</p>
                  <p class="text">Newell's &quot;Ceremonial Maze&quot; may not 
                    be too far off the mark. We speculate that the narrow passageways 
                    and dividers within the room may have been used for ritual 
                    performances with costumed dancers entering from the sides 
                    unexpectedly at key moments. The trenches lacking posts may 
                    have been covered with wooden planks to form foot drums. If 
                    so, lines of performers keeping beat with their feet would 
                    have created quite an otherworldly din within the smoky and 
                    dimly lit confines of the interior of the bird temple. Or 
                    the drama may have unfolded on the Mound A platform overlooking 
                    the building, an otherworldly place from which religious practitioners/performers 
                    emerged. Whatever the actual purpose of this building, it 
                    is unlike any other known at the site and, for that matter, 
                    unlike any other known in the Caddo world. It was, indeed, 
                    a &quot;special building.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">On the opposite side of Mound A was another 
                    intriguing, if not quite as unusual, structure. <strong>Building 
                    F9 </strong>measured about 11 meters (36 feet) across and stands 
                    out for a number of reasons: (1) instead of being circular, 
                    it is squared off with rounded corners (about 11 meters across; 
                    (2) it was built with a shallow depression 14 inches deep 
                    (other structures were built on the ground surface); (3) the 
                    exterior wall posts were set in a trench (the posts of ordinary 
                    houses at Davis were always set in individual holes, the wall 
                    trench is a Mississippian technique that is uncommon in the 
                    main Caddo Homeland, but often used in the Arkansas Basin); 
                    (4) there were five interior posts set at regular intervals 
                    around the circumference of the building (these may have supported 
                    benches); (5) the floor was formed by the addition of a thin 
                    layer of clay (prepared floors were rare at Davis); (6) the 
                    extended entranceway was higher than the floor level; (7) 
                    the structure was burned, yet not completely cleared away, 
                    as was the usual practice at the site; and (8) a great many 
                    artifacts were found within the building, most of which appeared 
                    to have been placed there <em>after</em> the building was burned. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Within Building F9 were over 4,600 pottery sherds, 
                    a piece of copper attached to a cord, fragments of three clay 
                    pipes, a ceramic ear spool, a ceramic effigy, and various 
                    stone tools and flint flakes. Only one other excavated Caddo 
                    building has been found to have such an array of artifacts 
                    near it and that is the apparent fire temple at the A.C. 
                    Saunders site, a Late Caddo center some 57 km (35 miles) upstream 
                    on the Neches River. While the small hearth in Building F9 
                    does not seem to fit the notion of a fire temple, the building 
                    was obviously something special. The purposeful depositing 
                    of debris, including broken ritual items, suggests that is 
                    was a conscious and presumably meaningful disposal of artifacts in the building site, perhaps following a ritual feast.</p>
                  <p class="text">There is a better candidate for a fire temple 
                    at the Davis site. <strong>Building 125</strong> was uncovered about 
                    half way between Mounds B and C. It had a simple, circular 
                    outline about 7.4 meters (24 feet) in diameter. In the center 
                    of the building was a deep and intensively used hearth that had 
                    been refurbished at least twice with new clay linings. This 
                    hearth is far more complex and intensively burned than any 
                    other known from the site. Another unusual feature is that 
                    four large interior posts were set at regular intervals around 
                    the hearth, presumably to support the roof. Interestingly, 
                    the posts were not placed on cardinal directions. This seems 
                    to fit the early historic descriptions of the Hasinai fire 
                    temple rather well:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>The perpetual fire, the distinguishing 
                      characteristic of the fire temple, was fed by four large, 
                      heavy, logs arranged in cruciform pattern so that the arms 
                      coincided with the cardinal points of the compass. In the 
                      center of the floor, where the four logs abutted, the flame 
                      was kept alive by feeding in small firewood from piles that 
                      were maintained outside the structure. The ashes from the 
                      fire were removed and were allowed to accumulate in a heap 
                      outside. </em>(Griffith 1954)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Special Cemetery </strong></p>
                  <p class="text">While is accurate to call Mound C a &quot;burial 
                    mound,&quot; it functioned as a special cemetery for certain 
                    privileged (&quot;elite&quot;) members of the Davis community 
                    and others who were singled out to accompany the elite in 
                    the afterlife. We are not sure where the ordinary villagers 
                    were buried, but it was not here. This special cemetery was 
                    established early in the site's history and periodically refurbished 
                    and reused for the next 300-400 years. The mound itself was 
                    built over the first pre-mound tomb as a flat-topped mound 
                    resembling those built to serve as platforms for temples. 
                    Once built, the mound was periodically enlarged and resurfaced, 
                    never standing any taller than about 20 feet (6 meters). Although 
                    the flat-topped appearance was maintained throughout its long 
                    period of use, no trace of any crowning structure was detected 
                    and it is likely that none was ever present.</p>
                  <p class="text">Only about a third of Mound C was excavated, 
                    and within this area 11 burial pits were investigated in 1968-1970 
                    by University of Texas crews led by Dee Ann Story. It is estimated 
                    that 15-20 burial pits remain in the unexcavated part of the 
                    mound. While most of the pits contained no more than one individual 
                    (or, more often,had no preserved bones), three large tombs 
                    had multiple interments (one with eight individuals and two 
                    with four). In contrast to the pattern at the Crenshaw site, 
                    none of the later tombs in Mound C at the Davis site significantly 
                    intruded into earlier tombs. (This suggests a continuity of 
                    community, a continuity that was perhaps broken at times during the 
                    history of the Crenshaw site.)</p>
                  <p class="text">In the center of Mound C were relatively large 
                    and complex tombs with elaborate grave offerings. Around the 
                    outside of the mound and surrounding the pre-mound tomb, most 
                    of the tombs were smaller and contained far fewer grave goods. 
                    This pattern suggests that the most important individuals 
                    were buried in the central area with less important people 
                    buried in the outer mound. These &quot;less important&quot; 
                    individuals were still buried in a special place in relatively 
                    large tombs and were probably not ordinary members of the 
                    community.</p>
                  <p class="text">We will not discuss each of the excavated tombs 
                    at Davis. The accompanying pictures provide glimpses of some 
                    of the variation. Instead we will briefly describe a few contrasting 
                    examples and then summarize some of the important patterns 
                    and unusual finds. The special cemetery at Davis began with 
                    the construction of a single, massive log-roofed tomb containing 
                    eight individuals and an array of fancy grave goods. This 
                    &quot;<strong>log tomb</strong>&quot; (designated Feature 134) measured 
                    about 23 by 18 feet (7 by 5.5 meters) and was dug 11 feet 
                    (3.5 meters) into the original earth. Two parallel rows of 
                    three large postholes ran along the north and south walls 
                    (long axis) of the tomb and presumably supported a low roof 
                    only about three feet above the tomb flour. The construction 
                    of the log tomb is inferred from stains and traces as no wood 
                    survived. </p>
                  <p class="text">On the floor of the log tomb were eight individuals 
                    in extended positions (heads to the north) and neatly arranged 
                    into four pairs. The heads of the pairs at either end were 
                    turned to face inward toward the center of the tomb. One of 
                    the central pairs faced toward the other central pair; the 
                    latter includes the paramount (most important) individual 
                    to judge from the arrangement of grave goods. Because of the 
                    very poor condition of the bone, the age and sex of the many 
                    of the individuals is not known. Of those that could be discerned, 
                    most were adults 20-30 years of age and most were males, but 
                    at least one was a female and another a child of about 6 years.</p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the offerings were placed on the north 
                    side of the log tomb, beyond the heads of the deceased, in 
                    clusters or piles. Among the numerous grave offerings were 
                    conch shell drinking cups, stone ear spools, stone celts (axe 
                    heads), wooden objects covered in thin sheets of copper, various 
                    patches of colored mineral pigments, effigy pipes, and arrow 
                    points. Many of these items were of exotic materials obtained 
                    hundreds of miles away. Interestingly, there were no pottery 
                    vessels in this first tomb. Although there are finely engraved 
                    vessels in some of the later tombs, these are found in small 
                    numbers that pale by comparison to the large numbers of pottery vessels 
                    (sometimes dozens) found in elite burials at other Caddo sites, 
                    especially those along the Red River.</p>
                  <p class="text">The apparent paramount individual in the log 
                    tomb at Davis had a beaded waist belt made of marine shell 
                    (probably whelk obtained from the Gulf coast) and an exceptionally 
                    large, beautifully made chipped-stone knife (sword, really). 
                    This spectacular artifact is almost certainly a prized symbol 
                    of authority and rank. It is almost 19 inches (480 mm) long, 
                    yet just over a half-inch thick (15 mm) at its thickest point, 
                    making it so delicate that it was broken by the weight of 
                    the soil when the tomb roof collapsed. It is made of an almost 
                    white exotic chert (flint) possibly obtained in the Midwest 
                    from the Mill Creek area of southern Illinois. Other somewhat 
                    similar, but much smaller knives were found in the clusters 
                    of offerings on the north side of the log tomb at Davis. </p>
                  <p class="text">When the log tomb was sealed, the extra earth 
                    from the pit was neatly piled around it, forming a low ring-shaped 
                    berm. The berm was constructed in a deliberate sequence of colored 
                    earth that was the reverse of the natural stratigraphy. In 
                    other words, the red surface soil was placed at the bottom, 
                    then a layer of orange soil, and finally a cap of yellow soil, 
                    the site's deepest. The roof of the tomb was covered with 
                    a thin layer of an unusual greenish (glauconitic?) soil, then the soil removed 
                    from the burial pit. Enough time elapsed for the tomb's roof 
                    to decay and collapse, spilling earth into the tomb and doubtlessly 
                    crushing some of the skeletons and delicate offerings. The 
                    collapsed tomb was then covered over (capped) by several layers 
                    of fill, creating the initial flat-topped mound. </p>
                  <p class="text">At least three burial pits were dug into and 
                    extended below the mound at this stage. Subsequently, the 
                    first mound was enlarged and capped by more fill layers, renewing 
                    the flat-topped mound. More burial pits were dug from the 
                    top and sides of this mound and then it too was renewed by 
                    a new cap. All burial pits extended into the premound soil, 
                    suggesting that reaching the original ground surface was ritually 
                    important. This pattern of burial use and mound capping/addition 
                    was repeated at total of five times over a 300-400-year period.</p>
                  <p class="text">In contrast to the log tomb, some burial pits, 
                    particularly those dug into the outer edges of the mound were 
                    much smaller and did not contain many offerings. For instance, 
                    one burial pit under the south edge of Mound C (Feature 156) 
                    measured only about 7 by 5.5 feet and contained only a single 
                    engraved pottery bottle. No bones were preserved, probably 
                    because the burial pit was relatively shallow (8 feet deep) 
                    and on the edge of the mound. </p>
                  <p class="text">The most complicated tomb (Feature 119) was 
                    located under the central mound. It measured about 22 by 16 
                    feet and its floor was 16 feet beneath the mound's surface. 
                    We can call this the &quot;<strong>cane tomb</strong>&quot;<strong> </strong>because 
                    there was a layer of cane (or coppice) above the four skeletons. 
                    (Woven cane mats or bundles of cane were probably placed on 
                    the floors of all of the tombs.) The cane layer was the roof 
                    or ceiling of the tomb, perhaps symbolically equivalent to 
                    the thatched roof of a house or temple.</p>
                  <p class="text">The four individuals buried in the cane tomb 
                    had been arranged in extended positions in two pairs. One pair 
                    was obviously paramount; these individuals were widely spaced 
                    with arms outspread (the legs were not exposed by excavation), 
                    heads placed facing up, and accompanied by high-status grave 
                    offerings. In contrast, the other pair of individuals was 
                    closely spaced, with arms to the sides, had few grave offerings, 
                    and had been arranged so that the heads faced east, toward 
                    the paramount pair. </p>
                  <p class="text">Like the log tomb, the cane tomb had concentrations 
                    of grave offerings on the north side of the tomb, above the 
                    heads. There were hundreds of individual items ranging from 
                    stream-worn pebbles (from a rattle?) and lumps of pigment 
                    to finely engraved bottles and human effigy pipes. The artifacts 
                    had been purposefully placed in two layers, one above and 
                    one below the cane layer capped by a thin layer of green clay. 
                    The paramount individuals had copper-covered wooden or stone 
                    earspools, bone pins, a large ceremonial knife, pearl and 
                    shell beads, traces of woven mats beneath some offerings (and 
                    perhaps the bodies), and copper stains, one of which was once 
                    a copper hair ornament, among other items. (Only half of the 
                    tomb was excavated; many more offerings were probably present.)</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>But how do we explain the multiple skeletons?</strong> 
                    In each tomb, the bodies were clearly interred during the 
                    same event while the bodies were still intact, leaving us 
                    to explain the coincidental deaths. Because of the lack of 
                    obvious signs of warfare or disease and because the tombs 
                    often contain individuals of different ages and different 
                    sexes, including many young adults, we suspect that most did 
                    not die a natural death. We suspect that the larger tombs 
                    contain a paramount individual who died a natural death and 
                    was accompanied by retainers or family members who were immolated 
                    (put to death) to honor the deceased and accompany him (or 
                    her) in the afterlife. </p>
                  <p class="text">Such behavior is well documented in the Southeast 
                    by archeological finds and, to a lesser degree, by early historic 
                    accounts. In 1725, the Frenchman Le Page du Pratz witnessed 
                    the ritual strangling of the wives, servants, and others to 
                    accompany the deceased brother of the Great Sun, the chief 
                    of the Natchez. Although it goes against our religious and 
                    civil sensibilities today, other forms of human sacrifice 
                    are well documented in prehistoric and contact period North 
                    America as well as in Mesoamerica, most infamously among the 
                    Aztecs (not to mention in Africa, Asia, and medieval Europe.) 
                    In North America, slaves taken from other tribes were chosen 
                    for sacrifice and it is possible that some or even all the 
                    retainers in the Davis graves were slaves.</p>
                  <p class="text">We think it more likely, however, that most of the individuals 
                    buried in Mound C were members of the Davis community. The 
                    repeated pattern of episodes of multiple interments can be 
                    speculatively linked to episodes of renewal and rebuilding 
                    at Mound A. There, evidence was found of the periodic dismantling 
                    of special structures, followed by capping of the dismantled 
                    buildings and the building of new structures, often of about 
                    the same size and in the same position as the just-buried 
                    building. Such cycles of renewal may be part of periodic ceremonies 
                    tied to some sort of ritual or astronomical cycles or perhaps 
                    to the deaths of paramount leaders. Unfortunately, the excavated 
                    skeletons at Davis were poorly preserved, rendering it impossible 
                    to make the detailed observations and comparisons that might 
                    confirm or deny our suggestions.</p>
                  <p class="text">Several intriguing patterns hint at the nature 
                    and meaning of the ritual behaviors represented by the special 
                    cemetery at Davis. The exact meanings are lost to the past, 
                    but the repeated patterns known from the Davis site and others 
                    are telling. One pattern is the arrangement of the skeletons 
                    within the tombs with multiple individuals. In most cases 
                    where the skulls were preserved, the heads of the presumed 
                    retainers/slaves faced toward the paramount individual. The 
                    paramount individuals had exotic artifacts obviously symbolizing 
                    authority and high rank such as the large flint knives, stone 
                    earspools sometimes covered in copper, shell beaded belts, 
                    and, in two cases, polished stone staffs made of exotic greenstone 
                    (these are often called &quot;spuds,&quot; an unfortunate, 
                    but memorable choice of terms). In the earlier graves most 
                    of the offerings are piled on the north side of the tomb, 
                    above (north of) the heads of the deceased. </p>
                  <p class="text">Another fascinating pattern is the <strong>purposeful 
                    selection and placement of layers of earth</strong> <strong>having certain 
                    colors and textures</strong>. Mound C is composed of dozens of 
                    cut and fill layers representing the digging and filling of 
                    pits and the addition of layers capping and even repairing 
                    the mound. Archeological trenches cut through many of these 
                    layers and showed both how complicated the sequence of events 
                    was and how purposeful the selection of fill was. With so 
                    many disturbances and intrusions, one would expect the mound 
                    fill would be jumbled and homogenized. That sometimes occurs, 
                    but often specific layers or fills were composed only of a 
                    certain soil with a markedly distinct color. One especially 
                    significant earth at Davis is a green glauconitic soil that 
                    may have been obtained from natural exposures elsewhere in 
                    the Neches River valley (such exposures are not known to occur in 
                    the site vicinity). A thin layer of this greenish gray soil 
                    was placed above the high status burials and almost nowhere 
                    else. (Newell reported finding an &quot;altar&quot; made of 
                    green clay on one of the Mound A platforms, but it was poorly 
                    documented.) The purposeful use of certain soils for certain 
                    layers suggests that the colors and perhaps the contrasts 
                    between colors had symbolic importance.</p>
                  <p class="text">The very deliberate and carefully arranged patterns 
                    represented by a single large tomb can be thought of as a 
                    sacred scene designed to symbolize, justify, and affirm the 
                    legitimacy, importance, and authority of the leader whose 
                    death occasioned the tomb. Such sacred scenes may well have 
                    embodied mythological stories such as origin myths and the 
                    central characters in those stories. These scenes must have 
                    reflected important Caddo icons in much the same way that 
                    Christians use the cross and the fish, as well as biblical 
                    characters and saints. For example, the pattern of pairs of 
                    bodies seen in two of the tombs may relate to Caddo stories 
                    recorded many centuries later that feature a pair of mythical 
                    twins. According to anthropologist Robert Hall, twin-related 
                    myths are known from many different groups in both North and 
                    South America and may have been part of the oral tradition 
                    of the earliest people in the New World.</p>
                  <p class="text">Another character common to much of the Mississippian 
                    world is often called the <strong>Bird-Man</strong>, a central icon 
                    in the Southern Cult or Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. The 
                    Bird-Man is usually a human figure (male) dressed in a feathered-wing 
                    costume with a bird mask clearly representing a raptor, probably 
                    the peregrine falcon. Variations on the Bird-Man theme are 
                    known from many engraved shell gorgets and drinking cups, 
                    on copper repouss&eacute; (raised relief) plates, and occasionally 
                    on pottery or stone artifacts from Etowah, Spiro, Moundville, 
                    and sites in eastern Tennessee, among others. In some depictions, 
                    the human and bird elements are combined such that the figure 
                    is neither human nor bird. Bird-Man or Man-dressed-as-Bird, 
                    the figure usually has arms and legs akimbo, as if dancing. 
                    Bird-Man usually looks fierce and warlike, sometimes brandishing 
                    weapons or grasping severed human heads. Another common element 
                    is a wide, beaded belt around the Bird-Man's waist. In sum, 
                    the Bird-Man is probably a mythical being associated with 
                    conflict and power, but one that was frequently personified 
                    in ritual dance at Mississippian centers.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Bird-Man personification may also be represented 
                    by several of the paramount individuals in the major tombs 
                    at the Davis site. The clearest examples come from a massive 
                    burial pit (Feature 118) measuring (at the top) 29 by 24 feet 
                    (9 by 7.5 meters) and dug down about 23 feet (7 meters) from 
                    the top of Mound C. This huge tomb contained only a single 
                    young adult (sex not determined) resting on his or her back 
                    with arms and feet spread out. Around the waist was a heavy 
                    belt made of tubular conch shell beads. At the right knee 
                    was a greenstone scepter. On either side of the head were 
                    copper-covered stone earspools apparently fastened to one 
                    another by a pearl-beaded band that went over the top of the 
                    head. Four clusters of 24-40 arrow points surely represent 
                    quivers of arrows placed around the body. The arrow points 
                    were arranged into clusters of different types of flint (chert) 
                    including some from central Texas and others from eastern 
                    Oklahoma. Other offerings include bits of copper, green pigment, 
                    shell, and possible bark cloth around the skull that may represent 
                    some sort of headdress, a pearl necklace, and a small flint 
                    knife. Frank Schambach thinks this individual is dressed and 
                    positioned as the Bird-Man, a suggestion we find compelling. 
                    Individuals in several other tombs at Davis may also represent 
                    the Bird-Man character. </p>
                  <p class="text">While we tend to assume that the tombs and graves 
                    in Mound C represent burial rites following the natural (or 
                    battle) deaths of leaders, this is hard to demonstrate. Given 
                    all the ritual patterning and the episodic nature of destruction 
                    and renewal cycles in Mound A, it is possible that we are 
                    wrong and that the triggering event was not the death of some 
                    important person. An alternative possibility that we do not 
                    rule out is that all of the individuals interred in the special 
                    cemetery at Davis may have been sacrificed during special 
                    ceremonies tied to either major events in the community's 
                    history, crises (such as severe droughts), or perhaps to celestial 
                    events (such as the alignment of Venus and Mars or a major 
                    eclipse). In other words, the ritual/astronomical event itself 
                    triggered death (sacrifice), not the other way around. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Demise of the Davis Community</strong></p>
                  <p class="text">We do not know exactly when the Caddo community 
                    who lived at the Davis site decided to move on. The community 
                    continued into the Middle Caddo period, but was in decline 
                    by the late13th century. The latest radiocarbon dates that 
                    make sense suggest that some activities continued into the 
                    14th century (early to mid-1300s), well over 450 years after 
                    the community was established. It is clear that the abandonment 
                    of the site was planned and orderly. </p>
                  <p class="text">The best evidence of this is that Mounds A and 
                    C (and probably B, although the evidence there was destroyed 
                    by plowing) were each capped with a final layer of clay that 
                    sealed the mounds. At Mound A, the final buildings were first 
                    dismantled, just like earlier buildings, and then a substantial 
                    layer of homogenous clay was added that physically capped 
                    the mound and symbolically sealed its contents. This same 
                    pattern has been seen at many other Caddo mound centers. When 
                    a Caddo community abandoned a place, ordinarily they did so 
                    with forethought and purpose. </p>
                  <p class="text">We do not know where the community moved. One 
                    candidate is the Washington Square site about 30 miles due 
                    east within what is now downtown Nacogdoches, Texas. The heyday 
                    of that site began in the mid-13th century, not long before 
                    construction and activity at the Davis site began to wane. 
                    Perhaps prestige and power of one ritual/political center 
                    was eclipsed by another, as must have happened many times 
                    in Caddo history. </p>
                  <h3>Other Early and Middle Caddo Sites</h3>
                  <p class="text">Hundreds of known Caddo sites have yielded pottery 
                    of Early and Middle Caddo styles, which are often very similar. 
                    Some of the better-known sites are shown on the accompanying 
                    map. Many of the same Early Caddo patterns seen at the Davis 
                    site and the Crenshaw site are present or suspected at many 
                    of these sites. Ritual centers, mounds capping special buildings, 
                    buildings built on mound platforms, special cemeteries, shaft 
                    tombs, evidence of social ranking, use of ritual items from 
                    distant sources, and so on. Most of the Early Caddo sites 
                    that have seen investigation are the larger sites with mounds. 
                    We know much less about small, non-mound sites. In the next 
                    section we take a closer look at a small Middle Caddo village 
                    and the continued development of Caddo society.</p>

                          the next 300-400 years. The deceased were placed into

                          sealed the mounds and the important temples and buildings 
                          that once stood here. Painting by Nola Davis, courtesy

                  <p class="text">While most Early Caddo sites occur within the 
                    Caddo Homeland, several outlier sites are known that appear 
                    to be seasonal farmsteads or temporary camps of Caddo groups 
                    far from home. One good example is the Chupik site on the 
                    Brazos River just west of Waco, Texas. We do not know why 
                    the Caddos camped there, but close parallels in artifact styles 
                    between items found at Chupik and at the Davis site suggest 
                    that they did. That coupled with the relatively large quantity 
                    of refuse, leads us to suspect that Chupik was seasonal farmstead 
                    or perhaps a short-lived attempt by a group of Davis-site 
                    Caddos to colonize a distant area.</p>
