      <p>Floor of the cane tomb. (Click to enlarge.) As can be seen, the four 
        individuals were arranged in extended positions in two pairs. The pair 
        on the right was obviously paramount (most important) as they were widely 
        spaced with arms outspread (the legs were not exposed by excavation), 
        heads placed facing up, and accompanied by high-status grave offerings. 
      </p>
      <p>In contrast, the other pair of individuals was closely spaced, with arms 
        to the sides, had few grave offerings, and had been arranged so that the 
        heads faced east, toward the paramount pair. The lesser pair (perhaps 
        slaves) were probably sacrificed in honor of the paramount individuals 
        (of whom the one on the far right was accompanied by the greatest amount 
        of offerings and personal ornaments.) Graphic by Dee Ann Story.</p>
