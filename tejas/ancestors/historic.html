                    into the interior of the Southeastern U.S. It was a long and

                    by inadvertently unleashed Old World diseases. The large Spanish 
                    army fed itself by demanding or simply confiscating food stores 
                    from native peoples as they moved from place to place attacking 
                    and usually defeating the towns and peoples who stood up to

                  <p class="text">In the last decade, Caddo archeologists and 
                    ethnohistorians have studied anew the contact between Europeans 
                    and Caddo peoples seeking to better understand how contact 
                    changed Caddo societies. Part of this renewed ethnohistoric 
                    and archeological interest has focused on reconstructing the 
                    precise routes of Spanish and French explorers and colonists, 
                    especially that of Hernando de Soto. At the same time, Caddo 
                    researchers have been reconsidering the socio-political character 
                    and ethnic identity of prehistoric and early historic Native 
                    American groups.</p>
                  <p class="text">In June, 1542, the De Soto entrada, led by <strong>Luis 
                    de Moscoso</strong>, entered into the Caddo world and over the 
                    next seven months passed through Caddo lands in present-day 
                    Arkansas and Texas. Perhaps not far behind were the Old World 
                    epidemic diseases. While Europeans would not tread again on 
                    Caddo lands for 144 years, the Caddo world continued to feel 
                    the impact of the spreading European colonization. Like the 
                    ripples of skipped stones on a pond, spreading and deflecting 
                    off of one another, the impacts of Old World intruders reverberated 
                    all across North America.</p>
                  <p class="text">Yet, despite close scrutiny of archeological, 
                    bioarcheological, and historical data, no real consensus as 
                    been reached on the precise effects of De Soto's first intrusion 
                    on the Caddo world. The interwoven and still unsettled questions 
                    include: How did Caddo populations change through time and 
                    across the homeland? When did epidemic diseases enter the 
                    Caddo area? When did post-contact population declines occur? 
                    And, what were the cultural impacts of those declines on Caddo 
                    societies and communities? </p>
                  <p class="text">One thing is clear, the all-too-easily (and 
                    often) told story: &quot;when the evil Spanish (and somewhat 
                    less evil French) came, the Caddo world was quickly ruined,&quot; 
                    is not true. The consequences of European colonization were 
                    ultimately catastrophic for Caddo peoples, but these unfolded 
                    in fits and starts over several centuries. Indeed, the story's 
                    twists and complications do not fit within a simple plot.</p>
                  <p class="text">When La Salle's expedition arrived among the 
                    Hasinai groups in 1686, most Caddo peoples lived primarily 
                    in relatively small groups on the Red River and in East Texas. 
                    Over the next century and a half Europeans laid claim to their 
                    lands and loyalties, and the Caddo found themselves wedged 
                    between the outer edges of the French and Spanish empires. 
                    Epidemic upon epidemic ravaged Caddo populations&#151;possibly 
                    by as much as 95 percentage between 1691 and 1816. Yet, European impact 
                    was not all disastrous. The Caddo were situated perfectly to 
                    participate in the French fur trade, and they traded guns, 
                    horses, and other essential items to Indian groups and Europeans. 
                    In the process they developed new trade and economic networks, 
                    and acquired new European goods and ornaments. The resulting 
                    economic symbiosis between the Caddo groups and Europeans 
                    was the key to the political success, resilience, and strength 
                    of the Caddo tribes through much of the colonial era.</p>
                  <h3>Caddo Territory</h3>
                  <p class="text">Over a century passed after De Soto's failed 
                    entrada before the Spanish again took notice of the Caddo, 
                    This time the Spanish came from the opposite direction, the 
                    southwest. In the mid-1600s, Spanish priests learned about 
                    the Caddo at La Junta de los R&iacute;os (the confluence of 
                    the Rio Grande and Rio Conchos), some 550 miles west of the 
                    nearest Caddo village. Jumano Indians, famed as long-distance 
                    travelers and traders, told the Spanish about the &quot;<strong>Great 
                    Kingdom of the Tejas</strong>,&quot; a populous and well-governed 
                    people. The term &quot;Tejas&quot; referred mainly to the 
                    Hasinai groups of east Texas, but the characterization applied 
                    equally well to the greater Caddo world. </p>
                  <p class="text">Before the initial European contact, in the 
                    early 1500s, the Hasinai Caddo groups lived in permanent communities 
                    throughout the upper Neches and Angelina river basins. They 
                    are represented archeologically by sites belonging to the 
                    Frankston phase (ca. 1400-1600) and Allen (ca. 1600-1800) 
                    phases of what archeologists call the Anderson Cluster. Although 
                    occasional Hasinai Caddo groups or bands lived west of the 
                    Neches and Trinity rivers in historic times, they usually 
                    did not go beyond that boundary, &quot;unless going to war,&quot; 
                    according to Henr&iacute; Joutel, the chronicler of the La 
                    Salle expedition. The Hasinai groups continued to live in 
                    the upper Neches and Angelina river basins until they were 
                    driven out of East Texas by the leaders of the Republic of 
                    Texas after 1836.</p>
                  <p class="text">European maps of the late 1500s to the mid-1600s 
                    located Caddo and Caddo-allied groups such as the Naguatex, 
                    Nisoone (Nasoni), Lacane, Ays, Xualatino (or Soacatino) and 
                    Guasco on a western tributary of a drainage labeled Rio de 
                    Leon or Rio de Spiritu (Espiritu) Santo, the Mississippi River, 
                    but it is clear from similarities between 1572 and 1656 maps 
                    that geographic knowledge of the territory of the interior-living 
                    Caddo and other Texas tribes had not changed over that period. 
                    It was not until Europeans (principally La Salle's group) 
                    ventured again into the Caddo area in the 1680s, that the 
                    territory of the various Caddo tribes, their non-Caddo allies, 
                    and their enemies became better understood.</p>
                  <p class="text"><br>
                    Delisle's map of 1703 places a series of related Caddo groups 
                    along a considerable stretch of a western tributary of the 
                    Mississippi River, obviously the Red River. Beginning on the 
                    lower Red River with the Nachitoches [Natchitoches] and proceeding 
                    up river, other Caddo groups included the Nakasa (one of the 
                    enemies of the Kadohadacho in 1687, according to Joutel), 
                    Yatache [Yatasi], Natsoos [Nanatsoho], Cadodaquiro [Cadohadacho], 
                    the [upper] Nachitoches, and the Nassonis [upper Nasoni]. 
                    Upstream from them on the Red River were the Canouaouana and 
                    Chaquanhe tribes, apparently enemies of the Cadohadacho, again 
                    according to Joutel.</p>
                  <p class="text">The westernmost Caddo groups were shown by Delisle 
                    (1703) living on and near the Rio aux Cenis (probably the 
                    Neches River), Cenis (or Senys) being the French name for 
                    the Hasinai Caddo. Other than the mistake of having the Rio 
                    aux Cenis running into the Red River, Delisle's map shows 
                    that the French had a good understanding of the locations 
                    of the various Hasinai Caddo groups, from the Inahe [Hainai] 
                    to the east (on the Angelina river), the Nadaco and Nassonis 
                    [lower Nasoni] to the north and west, and a series of Cenis 
                    (Hasinai) communities along the western boundaries of their 
                    territory. No Caddo communities are depicted west of the Trinity 
                    River (Rio Baho), with the closest non-Caddo communities living 
                    between the Trinity and Brazos (La Maligne R.) rivers. On 
                    the Brazos River lived the Canohatino tribe, one of the enemies 
                    of the Hasinai Caddo. That tribe felt the brunt of a French-Caddo 
                    attack in 1687 where more than 40 Canohatino were massacred 
                    by the joint armed forces.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the 1750s, the Europeans (especially the 
                    French) possessed a much better perception of the location 
                    of the Hasinai Caddo groups and related Caddo tribes in east 
                    Texas and western Louisiana. This is not surprising considering 
                    that, reportedly, there was a French trader living at each 
                    of the major Caddo settlements, even those in the province 
                    of Texas (which was claimed by Spain). In a 1757 French map, 
                    Caddo groups are dispersed from east of the Sabine River (Rio 
                    Zavinas), near the Spanish presidio at Los Adaes, to just 
                    west of the Neches River (Rio de Nechas), with Spanish missions 
                    in their midst at Nacoudoches [Mission Nuestra Senora de los 
                    Nacogdoches] and de los Hays [Mission Nuestra Senora Dolores 
                    de Ais].</p>
                  <p class="text">Between the 1750s and the 1780s, the Tawakoni, 
                    Yscani, and Kichai tribes, affiliated Wichita-speaking tribes, 
                    had moved south (from Kansas and Oklahoma) and settled in 
                    large villages along the margins of the Post Oak Savanna, 
                    in traditional Caddo hunting territory. The Hasinai Caddo 
                    tribes and the Wichita groups became strong allies, and the 
                    Caddo leaders were of great assistance in concluding formal 
                    and peaceful relations between the Wichita-speaking tribes 
                    and the Spanish in 1771-1772, and again between the Caddo, 
                    the Wichita-speaking tribes, and the Republic of Texas in 
                    1843. The Bidai tribe, also allies to the Hasinai, lived to 
                    their south along the Trinity and Neches-Angelina rivers.</p>
                  <p class="text">Because of the outbreak of epidemics at the 
                    Spanish settlement of Nacogdoches in the late 1770s to early 
                    1780s, the Nadaco Caddo moved north along the Caddo Trace 
                    (a major trade path/road probably in existence for hundreds 
                    of years) to resettle on the Sabine River, where they remained 
                    until the establishment of the Republic of Texas. The Cadohadacho 
                    groups, with populations also diminished by epidemics, by 
                    this time had coalesced into one village for protection against 
                    the Osage, and relocated by 1795 along a small tributary feeding 
                    into Caddo Lake, a natural lake formed by the Great Raft along 
                    the Red River valley. Most of the Cadohadacho remained in 
                    the Caddo Lake area until 1842, while others had moved into 
                    Indian Territory (Oklahoma) shortly after 1836, or had settled 
                    in the upper Trinity River drainage. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Hasinai Caddo groups&#151;the Nacogdoche, 
                    the Hasinai, and Nabedache&#151;remained in their east Texas 
                    homelands, living in the early 1800s outside of the Spanish 
                    settlement of Nacogdoches, west to the Neches River, and north 
                    of the El Camino Real. Anglo settlement had pushed immigrant 
                    Indians from the Southeastern U.S., including the Biloxi, 
                    Alabama, Coushatta, Choctaw, and Cherokee, into the Caddo 
                    Homeland. These groups began to settle within traditional 
                    Caddo territory, both north and south of Nacogdoches, as well 
                    as along the Red River north and east of Caddo Lake. The Alabama 
                    and Coushatta people asked for, and received, the permission 
                    of the Cadohadacho <em>caddi</em> to resettle along the Red 
                    River, and they became strong allies of the Caddo peoples. 
                    This was not the case with the Choctaw, as conflicts began 
                    between them and the Hasinai Caddo groups over hunting territories 
                    almost immediately after the Choctaw moved into East Texas. 
                    Later, however, the Choctaw allied with the Caddo peoples 
                    and the Cherokee in war parties against the Osage.</p>
                  <p class="text">Between about 1836 and 1842, the Hasinai, Nadaco, 
                    and Cadohadacho tribes had all been forcibly pushed out of 
                    East Texas, some moving into Indian Territory, while others 
                    moved west into the upper Brazos River drainage. This was 
                    the final and bitter end to the Caddo settlement of their 
                    traditional homelands. Though the Caddo groups made a successful 
                    agricultural living for a few short years in the hard but 
                    seemingly fertile lands of the Brazos River valley, they were 
                    never secure from Anglo-American encroachments, even when 
                    settled on the Brazos Reserve in 1855. They were compelled 
                    in 1859, according to John R. Swanton, noted ethnologist at 
                    the Smithsonian Institution, &quot;to abandon their homes, 
                    the fruit of their labors, and the graves of their kindred,&quot; 
                    and were removed to the Washita River valley in Indian Territory.

                  <h3>Interaction with Friends and Strangers</h3>
                  <p class="text">No Caddo community, town, or mound center was 
                    ever fortified, and there is little evidence in the archeological 
                    record for warfare or violent conflict between the Caddos 
                    and other peoples. That is, evidence of individuals dying 
                    from wounds inflicted from an arrowhead, scalping, or forms 
                    of mutilation after death are rare indeed, and seemingly very 
                    rare when compared to contemporaneous Indian groups in the 
                    Southern Plains and Southeast U.S. [Admittedly, the prevailing 
                    poor preservation of bone in the typically acidic soils of 
                    the Caddo Homeland lessens the chance that such evidence would 
                    be spotted.] The Caddo circumstance is also quite a contrast 
                    with the densely packed societies living in the Mississippi 
                    Valley and interior Southeast, where heavily populated towns 
                    were palisaded and where political and economic dominance 
                    was asserted through warfare. Prehistoric and historic Caddo 
                    settlement patterns are characteristically dispersed and lack 
                    any hint of a defensive posture. </p>
                  <p class="text">This is not to say that Caddo peoples can be 
                    regarded as peaceful and non-aggressive. Indeed, French and 
                    Spanish documents of the 17th and 18th centuries clearly show 
                    that the Hasinai and the Cadohadacho had many enemies, some 
                    of long-standing like the Chickasaw, Lipan Apache, and Osage. 
                    Relations with many of their other enemies probably alternated 
                    over the years between alliances and hostility, depending 
                    upon the needs of the moment, particularly the willingness 
                    to trade and confront common enemies. All this was to change 
                    with the appearance and adoption of the horse and gun among 
                    the Caddo and their Southern Plains neighbors.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the 1680s, non-agricultural groups (such 
                    as the various Apache bands) to the west and southwest of 
                    the Hasinai Caddo tribes had horses in numbers, but lacked 
                    guns, which the Caddo peoples began to obtain (if sometimes 
                    only periodically) in trade with the French fur traders. The 
                    Hasinai Caddo peoples also had horses obtained through trading 
                    with their allies on the prairies and plains of east-central 
                    and southern Texas (where herds of wild mustangs now roamed) 
                    and through raiding on their enemies. The Caddo groups were 
                    well placed at the juncture of the <strong>Horse Frontier</strong> and 
                    the <strong>Gun Frontier</strong>. As of about 1716, the Hasinai and 
                    the Cadohadacho territories marked, respectively, the frontier 
                    of horses moving eastward, and of muskets moving westward 
                    in trade. </p>
                  <p class="text">Access to desirable goods such as guns and horses 
                    contributed strongly to the maintenance and expansion of Caddo 
                    social and political power relationships with their Native 
                    American neighbors, allies, and enemies. Horses and guns allowed 
                    the Caddos to increase their bison hunting in the prairies 
                    and plains well west and southwest of their territory. This 
                    probably exacerbated existing animosities with peoples to 
                    the west, but did not prevent Caddos from establishing new 
                    hunting territories and new settlements astride Indian and 
                    European trade routes. It also assured the Caddo peoples of 
                    continued trade with the Europeans and an active role in arranging 
                    political and economic measures between other Native Americans 
                    and the Europeans that directly affected their well-being.</p>
                  <p class="text">Fighting between the Caddo and their enemies 
                    mainly consisted of hit-and-run raids upon an enemy, aimed 
                    at capturing or killing a few foe and snatching booty, rather 
                    than battles with large numbers of casualties on either side. 
                    This enmity did not prevent the Caddo peoples from hunting 
                    and trading regularly west of the Trinity River both before 
                    and after they had the horse. The Hasinai Caddo peoples were 
                    quite familiar with these regions, giving Fray Mazanet in 
                    1691 their names for each of the streams from the Nabedache 
                    village on San Pedro Creek (just west of the Neches River) 
                    200 miles to the southwest in the San Antonio area. Once they 
                    acquired horses, Caddo hunters expanded their forays into 
                    portions of north, central, and south Texas to obtain deer 
                    and bison hides for trade with the French.</p>
                  <p class="text">For the Cadohadacho tribes, on the other hand, 
                    according to Joutel in 1687, &quot;most of the hostile tribes 
                    are to the east...and have no horses; it is only those towards 
                    the west which have any.&quot; The hostile tribes to the east 
                    (especially the Osage) had plentiful supplies of guns obtained 
                    from both French and British sources, and they aggressively 
                    raided Caddo villages and seized Caddo slaves, horses, and 
                    furs.</p>
                  <p class="text">This disparity in supplies of the coveted horses 
                    and guns led to a profitable trade for the Caddo peoples, 
                    either in direct exchange or acting as middlemen. But over 
                    the long-run, the trade bounty did not serve to better protect 
                    them against the Osage and Chickasaw, who ceaselessly raided 
                    the Caddo for slaves from the late 1600s to the early 1700s. 
                    Shortly thereafter, the Caddo became involved in the thriving 
                    traffic in Apache slaves, an outcome of the Southern Plains 
                    warfare between the Comanche and Apache that began in the 
                    early 1700s. The Caddo traded Apache children for European 
                    goods at the French and Spanish markets at Natchitoches and 
                    Los Adaes. By the 1760s, the Osage were expanding their hunting 
                    and trapping territory to obtain more furs, however, and their 
                    depredations against the Caddo changed to a war of conquest. 
                    Over a period of about 80 years, the Osage succeeded in reducing 
                    the Kadohadacho tribes from five villages to only one. This 
                    reduction forced the Cadohadacho, along with the Yatasi, to 
                    move far down the Red River, closer to the European post and 
                    fort at Natchitoches, abandoning the Great Bend area, in a 
                    desperate attempt to escape the aggressive expansion of the 
                    Osage tribe.</p>
                  <h3>Caddo Responses </h3>
                  <p class="text">European epidemic diseases among the Caddo peoples 
                    resulted in regional population declines (certainly noticeable 
                    after 1691), group movements, and the eventual coming together 
                    of once-separate Caddo bands. It has been estimated that Caddo 
                    populations plummeted by as much as 75 percentage between 1687 and 1790 
                    due to epidemics. Population declines and settlement changes 
                    appear to have been more substantial along the major rivers, 
                    as seen by the complete abandonment of the Ouachita and Little 
                    rivers by 1700, and the Arkansas River earlier in the 1600s, 
                    but there was no major abandonment of east Texas by the Hasinai 
                    Caddo in historic times. The view here is that the strong 
                    Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and Natchitoches alliances (&quot;confederacies&quot;) 
                    that were formed in the early 1700s were a direct result of 
                    regional population decline, village abandonment, and group 
                    coalescence. </p>
                  <p class="text">While the establishment of the Spanish missions 
                    in the southern part of the Caddo homeland failed to convert 
                    Caddo peoples into Christianity and to resettle Caddo communities 
                    around the missions, some Caddo apparently chose mission life 
                    rather than remain in east Texas. After the east Texas missions 
                    failed in the early 1730s, a few Tejas (Hasinai) individuals 
                    were enrolled at missions San Jose and Valero [also known 
                    as the Alamo] in San Antonio in the mid to late 1700s. The 
                    vast majority, however, stayed put in the homeland.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddos' participation in the fur trade (mainly 
                    deer and buffalo hides) had important consequences for them, 
                    as well as for their European partners in the trading system. 
                    Through the fur trade, the Caddo acquired and accumulated 
                    large quantities of desirable European goods, which they in 
                    turn kept for their own use or exchanged with other Indian 
                    groups for furs and horses, all the while exploiting existing 
                    trade networks to their advantage. Trade success also allowed 
                    the Caddo to expand their hunting activities into new territories, 
                    and/or reoccupy abandoned river valleys (such as the upper 
                    Sabine River basin after about 1740) for the same purposes. 
                    The Caddo's participation in the European frontier economy 
                    was recognized and rewarded by the French and Spanish governments 
                    through programs of annual gifts and presents. Such programs 
                    reflect the existence of political and economic commitments 
                    between the Caddo peoples and the Europeans. These all had 
                    considerable economic, military, and social prestige to the 
                    Caddo peoples in their dealings with other Indian groups.</p>
                  <p class="text">George Sabo's ethnohistorical studies of late 
                    17th and early 18th century Caddo societies in East Texas 
                    have shown how the Caddo drew Europeans into their world by 
                    including them in sacred and secular rituals and ceremonies. 
                    This inclusion gave the Caddo the means to absorb and manipulate 
                    Europeans. In effect, the Caddo made foreigners in their midst 
                    part of the tribe and created intricate social relationships 
                    with them following the same basic principles that ordered 
                    and shaped Caddo societies. This helps explain why Caddo rituals 
                    and greetings seemed excessive to Europeans and why discussions 
                    of these exchanges seem to dominate much of the Spanish and 
                    French archival documents. Similar interactions are sadly 
                    missing from the observations and records of the Americans, 
                    strongly hinting that the Caddo by the 1810s were unable to 
                    exploit existing American trade and military relationships 
                    in the same way they had the Spanish and the French. </p>
                  <p class="text">Even in the late 18th and early 19th century, 
                    Caddo political leaders were still recognized as politically 
                    astute and masterful mediators and alliance-builders between 
                    European and Anglo-American explorers and colonists, as well 
                    as with Native American groups such as the Comanche, Wichita, 
                    and Apache tribes. Among the most influential Caddo leaders 
                    were the <em>caddices (or caddis)</em> Tinhiouen (from ca. 1760-1789) 
                    and Dehahuit (from ca. 1800-1833) of the Kadohadacho, and 
                    Iesh or Jose Maria (from about 1842 to 1862) of the Anadarko 
                    or Nadaco tribe.</p>
                  <p class="text">As their world was transformed from the outside, 
                    Caddo ritual beliefs and political practices changed on the 
                    inside as well. For instance, Father Gaspar Jose de Sol&iacute;s 
                    noted in 1768 among the Nabedache, the westernmost of the 
                    Hasinai Caddo tribes, that a Caddo women called Santa Adiva 
                    was the principal authority, instead of the <em>xinesi</em> 
                    and <em>caddi</em>, hereditary male leaders. Such a change was 
                    likely related to epidemics that had decimated Hasinai villages 
                    after the coming of the missionaries, as well as to the Spanish 
                    policy of presenting the staff of leadership to an elected 
                    leader, rather than following the then unbroken hereditary 
                    chain. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the larger context of Caddo society, however, 
                    the hereditary chain of Caddo leadership&#151;strong, peace- 
                    and alliance-building <em>caddis</em>&#151;seems to have continued 
                    unbroken among the Hasinai and Kadohadacho; this ultimately 
                    was the source of their strength. From European and American 
                    accounts, it is clear that the Caddo political leaders played 
                    important and influential roles in shaping the major political 
                    decisions of the day to favor the Caddo peoples, decisions 
                    that affected other Native American groups and Europeans, 
                    and in arranging and bringing to fruition alliances (even 
                    though temporary) between the Caddo, powerful Native American 
                    groups like the Comanche and Wichita tribes, and European 
                    nations. </p>
                  <p class="text">Waves of Anglo-American immigrants after about 
                    1815 established permanent, ever-expanding settlements in 
                    the region. It was the Caddos' misfortune to have been living 
                    on choice and fertile farmlands desired by the Anglo-Americans. 
                    In a few short years, they were dispossessed of their traditional 
                    homelands by the U.S. and Texas governments, their lands and 
                    goods swindled from them by U.S. Federal Indian agents in 
                    the Caddo Treaty of 1835, and eventually they were forced 
                    in 1859 to relocate from the Brazos Reserve in Texas to the 
                    Wichita Agency in western Oklahoma (then Indian Territory). 
                    Shortly thereafter, they were caught up in the Union and Confederate 
                    struggle for the Indian Territory during the Civil War, and 
                    with little trust for either the rebel or federal governments, 
                    the Caddo tribe abandoned their lands in Indian Territory 
                    for lands in Kansas. </p>
                  <h3>Historic Caddo Archeology </h3>
                  <p class="text">Finding, recognizing, and positively identifying 
                    Caddo archeological sites dating after A.D. 1680, even famous 
                    ones mentioned repeatedly in historical documents, has often 
                    proven hard to do. Most of the archeological research done 
                    on &quot;historic-era&quot; Caddo sites has involved sites 
                    and site components dating to the protohistoric era, that 
                    part of the Late Caddo period from 1542 to about 1680. Items 
                    of European manufacture are extremely rare in sites dating 
                    to this period, as could be expected because the Caddo did 
                    not have sustained contact with Europeans until after 1686. 
                    But it is surprising that early 18th-century Caddo sites may 
                    have little or no definitive evidence of European contact.

                  <p class="text">For instance, a well-studied Late Caddo farmstead 
                    called the <strong>Cedar Grove site</strong> in Lafayette County, Arkansas, 
                    is thought to date to A.D. 1650-1750 because of close matches 
                    between its Caddo pottery and that found elsewhere of known 
                    age (a technique known as &quot;cross-dating&quot;). Yet, 
                    apart from two bone &quot;beads&quot; found in a grave, there 
                    is not a single item from among the thousands of artifacts 
                    recovered at the site that could be of European manufacture. 
                    (A recent study suggested the bone &quot;beads&quot; were 
                    more likely to be children's toys by by the Caddo.) Still, 
                    the ceramic evidence strongly suggested the site dated to 
                    early historic times. To confirm their strong suspicions, 
                    the archeologists who analyzed the Cedar Grove site tried 
                    radiocarbon dating, archeomagnetic dating, and thermoluminescent 
                    dating. All three yielded frustratingly imprecise or inaccurate 
                    age estimates. Still, cross-dating the site's large ceramic 
                    collection shows pretty convincingly that the site spans the 
                    late 17th and early 18th centuries. </p>
                  <p class="text">Other historic Caddo sites have been located 
                    by matching up places mentioned in historic documents with 
                    archeological sites. But this too can be an exercise in frustration. 
                    Early maps and travel logs were imprecise, even in distinctive 
                    river valleys such as that of the Red River. The Red River 
                    has meandered throughout its history, carving new channels 
                    and abandoning old ones when major floods strike. Today the 
                    river continues to change its course from time to time despite 
                    the best efforts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Early 
                    maps can help identify where and when the river has changed, 
                    but topographically accurate maps were not made in the region 
                    prior to the late 19th century. And it is not just the river's 
                    swinging course. Historic and modern land use practices, especially 
                    farming, but also the construction of roads, bridges, and 
                    levees, have severely altered the lay of the land.</p>
                  <p class="text">A good example of the challenge of precisely 
                    locating and identifying known sites important to Caddo history 
                    is case of the <strong>Roseborough Lake site</strong> in Bowie County, 
                    Texas. This site overlooks an oxbow lake (abandoned channel) 
                    in the Red River Valley about four miles upstream from the 
                    Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores site complex (the upper Nasoni village 
                    visited and depicted in the Ter&aacute;n map). The Roseborough Lake 
                    locality has long been known to contain abundant European 
                    artifacts dating to the early to mid-18th century (and later). 
                    Among them are items of earthenware, porcelain, and stoneware, 
                    as well as many kinds of metal artifacts (gun parts, knives, 
                    nails, etc.), glass beads, and glass bottle fragments. Historic 
                    documents indicated that Benard de La Harpe established a 
                    French trading/military post in the vicinity in 1719. Were 
                    La Harpe's post and the Roseborough Lake locality one and 
                    the same, as a study published in 1973 tentatively concluded? 
                    Or was Roseborough Lake instead the scene of the later Caddo 
                    Post established and run by Alexis Grappe and his family in 
                    the 1730s.</p>
                  <p class="text">Historians and archeologists poured over old 
                    accounts, maps, and the many European artifacts from the site 
                    and debated these possibilities. There were other candidate 
                    localities, including the Moore's part of the upper Nasoni 
                    village. The matter was not decided conclusively until historical 
                    archeologist Kathleen Gilmore from North Texas State University 
                    brought her undergraduate students to Roseborough Lake in 
                    1976 and carried out test excavations. Gilmore carefully compared 
                    what she found at the site (and that found by others) with 
                    statements in the many related documents, some of which were 
                    contradictory or at least ambiguous. Roseborough Lake, she 
                    concluded, must be the later Caddo Post of Alexis Grappe and 
                    not that of La Harpe. The timing of Gilmore's fieldwork was 
                    fortuitous. Only a few years later the property was sold to 
                    an international soybean company headquartered, ironically, 
                    in France. The company soon cleared the entire area and contoured 
                    it for commercial farming, rendering the Roseborough Lake 
                    site virtually unrecognizable.</p>

                  <p class="text">Archeological investigation of later Caddo history 
                    (and earlier as well) is often a race against &quot;progress&quot; 
                    as our final example will attest. In the early 1970s, archeologist 
                    Elton Prewitt of the University of Texas at Austin led a field 
                    crew that surveyed and evaluated archeological and historical 
                    sites that were to be covered by a planned water supply and 
                    recreation reservoir. The city of Nacogdoches contracted with 
                    the university to do the archeological work as part of the 
                    Environmental Impact Assessment required by the federal government 
                    prior to approval of a permit for the lake. Prewitt and crew 
                    did further work at the five sites they judged most important 
                    of the sixteen they had located. As is often the case, there 
                    was not money (or time) to fully investigate any of the sites 
                    and one site in particular seemed to be getting shorted. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the late 1930s, amateur archeologists from 
                    Nacogdoches had excavated a very late Caddo cemetery dating 
                    mainly to the early 18th century at a locality that came to 
                    be known as the <strong>Deshazo site</strong>. Prewitt had located and 
                    extensively tested other parts of the site and had found tantalizing 
                    but sparse evidence of what he suspected was a small, well-preserved 
                    Caddo settlement whose occupants had probably been buried 
                    in the cemetery. With no money and time running out, he encouraged 
                    Dee Ann Story, professor of anthropology at the university, 
                    to hold her 1975 summer field school at the site. Dam construction 
                    delays allowed Story and her students to return for at second 
                    season in 1976 just before the reservoir began to fill. It 
                    was not until the final season that enough work had been done 
                    to piece together most of the story.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the late 17th century and the early to 
                    mid-18th century, the Deshazo site was home to a small community 
                    of Caddos who were almost certainly members of one of the 
                    Hasinai groups in the Nacogdoches area who were known to Joutel 
                    in 1686 and to the Spanish in the early 1690s. Archeologically, 
                    the Deshazo site belongs to the Allen phase, the historic-era 
                    successor of the Frankston phase. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Deshazo community consisted of perhaps 30-50 
                    people who lived in three or four of the typical circular, 
                    grass-thatched Caddo houses about 9-12 meters (20-40 feet) 
                    in diameter. Most of the houses were on either side of an 
                    open plaza. One structure stood alone across a small spring-fed 
                    creek from the main hamlet and is thought to have been an 
                    assembly house or perhaps the residence of the community's 
                    priest or headman. Also on that side of the creek was the 
                    small cemetery where 11 adults were buried. The graves of 
                    three children were found beneath the floors of the houses 
                    across the creek.</p>
                  <p class="text">Much more of interest was learned about the 
                    Caddo people who lived at the Deshazo site than can be told 
                    here, but one conclusion stands out. The lives of these Caddos 
                    remained little changed from those of their Late Caddo period 
                    ancestors (Frankston phase). They lived in the same kind of 
                    small community, built the same houses (and ramadas), made 
                    lots of Caddo pottery, dumped most of their trash in a community 
                    midden, had their own cemetery, buried their children who 
                    died young at home (literally), and offered their finest possessions 
                    as offerings in the graves of family members. </p>
                  <p class="text">The people of the Deshazo community had relatively 
                    few items of European manufacture and almost all of those 
                    (some 4600 glass trade beads, two iron knives and a copper 
                    alloy handbell with a petrified wood clapper) were grave offerings 
                    buried with the adults. (The beads are tiny and were strung 
                    by the hundreds on a single strand of a multi-strand necklace.) 
                    In the vicinity of the houses the only definitive trade goods 
                    were four small trade beads. The absence of gun parts, which 
                    are increasingly common in later Caddo sites in the area, 
                    seems to hint that the Deshazo hamlet was occupied mainly 
                    before 1714 when the French established a trading post at 
                    Natchitoches, about 100 miles to the east. Or perhaps guns 
                    just did not trickle down to this small community. The trade 
                    beads suggest the site may have been occupied into the mid 
                    or even late 18th century.</p><div align="center"><a href="credits.html"><img src="../../images/arrowbig.gif" alt="Follow Caddo History" width="236" height="42" border="0"></a>
