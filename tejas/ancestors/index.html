    <h2>Uncovering Early Caddo History </h2>
	<img src="images/maincollage.jpg" alt="Collage about Caddo history" width="780" height="350">
	  <p class="text">This exhibit traces the early history of the ancestors of 
        the Caddo people from dim patterns thousands of years old through the 
        Caddo era of greatness from about A.D. 800 to the late 1700s. Most of 
        the evidence comes from the ground, uncovered by archeologists in many 
        places across the Caddo Homeland. Here we try to summarize what has been 
        learned and attempt to answer some very difficult historical questions: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text">When did the Caddo and their immediate ancestors first 
            occupy their traditional homeland?</li>
        <li class="text">When, where, and how did distinctly Caddo culture originate? 
        </li>
        <li class="text">What was life like for Caddo ancestors, especially during 
            the long era of Caddo greatness? </li>
        <li class="text">How and why did Caddo societies change through time? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">These questions are difficult to answer because they are 
        so BIG and because we are asking about things that happened long before 
        written history. Nonetheless, in this exhibit we do our best to answer 
        these questions, summarize the evidence upon which most of our inferences 
        are based, and point out what more we need to know.</p>
      <p class="text">Most of the sections making up this large exhibit follow 
        history from earliest times to latest. While each section is meant to 
        stand on its own, the overall story is an historical narrative that can 
        be understood best by following the sections in chronological order. To 
        make this easy, simply click on the &quot;Follow Caddo History&quot; button 
        at the bottom of each section. Parts of the story discuss matters in more 
        detail than readers may have time or interest in. Thus, we use Sidebar 
        pages in the Caddo Ancestors exhibit that you can bypass or follow to 
        learn more. The Sidebar pages are mostly text.</p>
      <p class="text">Here is a brief description of each of the main sections 
        in the suggested reading order:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="text"><a href="tracing.html" class="text">Tracing Early Caddo 
          History</a>: brief introduction to the major challenges facing anyone 
          who seeks to understand the early history of Caddo ancestors.</li>
        <li class="text"><a href="first.html" class="text">Those Who Came First</a>: 
          overview of the early peoples who lived in and near the Caddo Homeland 
          during the Archaic era, prior to about 500 B.C. The distant ancestors 
          of today's Caddo were probably already living in the area, but they 
          are hard to identify.</li>
        <li class="text"><a href="woodland.html" class="text">Woodland Cultures</a>: 
          a lengthy section with several subsections covering the period between 
          about 500 B.C and A.D. 800 during which the ancestors of the Caddo and 
          their neighbors developed or adopted many of the characteristics of 
          later Caddo life: sedentary settlements, gardening, pottery making, long-distance 
          exchange of ritual items, mound building, and complex community-oriented 
          ceremonialism. </li>
        <li class="text"><a href="early.html" class="text">Early Caddo</a>: lengthy 
          section with several subsections on Formative (or Emerging) Caddo (A.D. 800-1000) and 
          Early Caddo (A.D.1000-1200) periods when Caddo culture developed as 
          a unique expression of the larger Southeastern cultural tradition. 
          The Crenshaw site in Miller County, Arkansas, and the George C. Davis site in 
          Cherokee County, Texas, are used to help explain the emergence and crystallization 
          of the Caddo cultural tradition. </li>
        <li class="text"><a href="middle.html" class="text">Middle Caddo</a>: 
          the Oak Hill Village site in Rusk County, Texas, provides an unusually 
          complete look at a small Caddo settlement. </li>
        <li class="text"><a href="late.html" class="text">Late Caddo</a>: review 
          of the latest prehistoric period (A.D. 1400-1680) during which Caddo culture reached its apogee and Caddo 
          peoples lived in villages, hamlets, and farmsteads throughout the entire Caddo Homeland 
          at all-time high population levels.</li>
        <li class="text"><a href="titus.html" class="text">Titus Phase</a>: Caddo 
          Farmers in Northeast Texas, A.D. 1430-1680: More-detailed look at one 
          local area and period for which we now know a great deal about life 
          during Late Caddo times.</li>
        <li class="text"><a href="historic.html" class="text">Early Historic</a>: 
          overview of that portion of the early historic era (A.D. 1680-1835) 
          during which Caddo life was fundamentally altered and all but destroyed 
          by the impact of European colonization and its consequences. </li>
        <li class="text"><a href="credits.html" class="text">Credits and Sources</a>: 
          acknowledgments of the many contributors to this exhibit as well as 
          where to turn to learn more. </li>
