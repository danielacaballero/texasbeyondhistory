                  <p class="text">The<strong> Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1200-1400) 
                    </strong>was a time of changing settlement patterns, economic changes, 
                    and exuberant experimentation with engraved and utilitarian pottery styles. 
                    In fact, archeologists sometimes have difficulty recognizing 
                    Middle Caddo sites as such because there are few well-defined 
                    pottery styles. Compared to the Early Caddo pottery, which 
                    looks very similar from place to place, the fine wares made 
                    by Middle Caddo potters express far greater individuality 
                    and creativity. </p>
                  <p class="text">This upsurge in ceramic creativity during the 
                    13th and 14th centuries coincides with the expansion of Caddo 
                    settlements in many places across the homeland. A shift seems 
                    to have taken place from a predominance of larger mound centers 
                    like the Crenshaw and Davis sites to smaller communities including 
                    small villages and hamlets as well as agricultural farmsteads. 
                    This shift may be mainly a reflection of an economic shift 
                    from a more diverse economy toward increasing reliance on 
                    corn agriculture. Corn farming requires lots of space and 
                    the growing crop must be closely watched, weeded, and, as 
                    it matures, guarded to keep birds and mammals (especially 
                    raccoons) from ravaging the corn. Many Caddo farmers moved to the 
                    country, so to speak.</p>
                  <p class="text">In recent decades archeologists have investigated 
                    various large and small sites dating primarily to the Middle 
                    Caddo period. They have found everything from small seasonal 
                    campsites or single-family farmsteads that seem to lack substantial 
                    houses and refuse middens to ritual (mound) centers that continue 
                    many of the patterns seen at the Davis site (which continued 
                    well into the Middle Caddo period). The larger sites were 
                    important civic-ceremonial centers containing multiple mounds 
                    and associated villages. The multiple mound centers are rather 
                    evenly spaced along the Red River, the Sabine River, and Big 
                    Cypress Bayou, and those that are contemporaneous may represent 
                    an integrated regional network of interaction and redistribution. 
                    For example, the Jamestown (eight mounds and village), Boxed 
                    Springs (four mounds, village, and large cemetery), and Hudnall-Pirtle 
                    (eight mounds and 60-acre village) sites appear to represent 
                    the apexes (central places) of three Early and Middle Caddo 
                    networks in the Sabine River basin.</p>
                  <p class="text">Among the premier mound centers in the Neches-Angelina 
                    river basin, the <strong>Washington Square</strong> <strong>site </strong>in the 
                    middle of what is today Nacogdoches, Texas, dates mainly to 
                    the Middle Caddo period. The site once consisted of at least 
                    three mounds separated by a long plaza area and with an associated 
                    village. Most of the site has been destroyed as Nacogdoches 
                    has grown. Two mound remnants have been partially excavated 
                    by Jim Corbin and his students at Stephen F. Austin State University 
                    and the 1985 field school of the Texas Archeological Society. 
                    Extensive excavations documented a circular structure under 
                    Mound 1/2, an assortment of pits and postholes in non-mound 
                    contexts, and several large burial pits in a mortuary mound 
                    (the Reavely-House Mound). Although little evidence of the 
                    village apparently survives, large sherd-filled pits (representing 
                    many vessels) were encountered in an area between the two 
                    mounds. These are thought to be deposits from public feasting 
                    activities led by the Caddo elite that used the Washington 
                    Square site as a ceremonial center in the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>Haley site</strong> is another ceremonial 
                    center dating to the Middle Caddo period and one of the most 
                    famous of all Caddo sites. It is located on a levee of the 
                    Red River in southwestern Arkansas about 20 miles north of 
                    the Louisiana state line. The Haley site had two prominent 
                    mounds and probably once had other smaller mounds. C.B. Moore 
                    excavated most of one mounds in 1912, finding nine shaft tombs 
                    now known to date to the Middle Caddo period. He tested the 
                    other mound and, finding no burials, concluded (probably correctly) 
                    it was a &quot;temple mound.&quot; Since the 1960s, amateur 
                    archeologists and pothunters have found two sizable cemeteries 
                    at the site and have dug up over 100 burials. </p>
                  <p class="text">Although some archeologists have suggested that 
                    Haley was strictly a &quot;ceremonial and burial center,&quot; 
                    we suspect that associated village areas were close by. The 
                    Haley site is best known for its unusually ornate pottery, 
                    which exemplifies Middle Caddo pottery creativity. Tellingly, 
                    many of the pottery styles found at Haley are known only from 
                    a short stretch of the Red River Valley extending southward 
                    into northernmost Louisiana. A few obvious trade pieces do 
                    show up elsewhere, but the limited distribution area must 
                    demark the territory of the local group (polity). </p><br>

                  <p class="text">Some 100 miles to the southwest from Haley, 
                    a fascinating Middle Caddo village was discovered during archeological 
                    investigations in advance of a large lignite (coal) surface 
                    mine. The <strong>Oak Hill Village site</strong> in Rusk County, Texas, 
                    occupied a small ridge overlooking Mill Creek, a tributary 
                    of the Sabine River. More is now known about this Oak Hill 
                    Village site in Rusk County, Texas than perhaps any other 
                    site dating to the period. On behalf of TXU Mining Company 
                    LP, archeologists from the private consulting firm PBS&amp;J 
                    used heavy machinery and hand excavation to open up broad 
                    areas, and thus were able to expose the &quot;footprint&quot; 
                    of virtually an entire small village. Postholes and pits dug 
                    through the sandy soil into the underlying clay were visible 
                    once large areas of the site were scraped off with machines 
                    and then cleaned by hand. The ridge upon which the village 
                    was built had been plowed and contoured by modern farming, 
                    thus disturbing the upper deposits of the site.</p>
                  <p class="text">Oak Hill Village had at least 42 circular and 
                    rectangular structures representing at least three successive 
                    villages. The structures that were part of the last and largest 
                    village were arranged over a 3.5-acre area in a circular pattern 
                    around a central plaza area. Sorting out which of the structures 
                    were contemporaneous was very difficult because some of the 
                    structures had been rebuilt over and over and some overlapped 
                    earlier structures, particularly at the northwestern end of 
                    the ridge and plaza. Working out how the village changed during 
                    its 300-year span was also hard because most of the structures 
                    were only recognized after the heavy machines had scraped 
                    away what would have been the floor level (thus, removing 
                    any evidence of the actual house floors and artifacts that 
                    had survived modern plowing). Nonetheless, analysts were able 
                    to work out the basic sequence of the village phases, called 
                    here the early, middle, and late villages.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Early Village at Oak Hill began as early 
                    as A.D. 1150 (or perhaps a few decades later). It consisted 
                    of four large rectangular structures, each measuring about 
                    7 x 11 meters (23 x 36 feet). These are thought to be houses 
                    that would have been suitable for 10-20 people. A total of 
                    40-70 people probably lived at the site during this phase. 
                    Rectangular houses are not common in the region, but are known 
                    at other Middle Caddo sites, including the Ferguson site in Arkansas, 
                    the Belcher site in Louisiana, and the Hines site in Wood 
                    County, Texas. The early houses at Oak Hill were not arranged 
                    around a plaza.</p>
                  <p class="text">By A.D. 1250 the Middle Village had been reorganized 
                    and the house style had changed from rectangular to circular 
                    buildings like those typical of most Caddo sites in northeast 
                    Texas. The middle village phase was the most intensive of 
                    the three and lasted a full 100 years. Most of the superimposed 
                    building patterns (most of them surely houses) date to this 
                    phase. The exact number of houses in use at any one time is 
                    unknown because of the overlapping outlines. The structures 
                    making up the middle village at Oak Hill were arranged around 
                    an open plaza covering at least 15 x 25 meters (about 50 x 80 
                    feet). The total village population is estimated at between 
                    75 and 100 people. </p>
                  <p class="text">One of the clusters of three overlapping structural 
                    patterns at the north end of the Middle Village was apparently 
                    covered by a low mound, upon which a new building may have 
                    been placed (the evidence was destroyed by plowing and machine 
                    scraping). This mound probably covered a special building 
                    of some sort, perhaps the house of the village headman or 
                    a small temple.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the Late Village phase, dating from about 
                    A.D. 1350 to as late as 1450, the village expanded to the 
                    south and new types of structures were built along with more 
                    of the circular houses. Total village population is estimated 
                    to have reached an all-time high of at least 100, perhaps 
                    a bit more. Two of the new structures at the south end have 
                    long extended entranceways pointing to the north (and the 
                    main village area). These are clearly &quot;special buildings&quot; 
                    although it is not known whether they were temples or the 
                    houses of the village headman or priest. Also new during the 
                    Late Village is the addition of interior partitions to several 
                    buildings and the construction of four small circular structures 
                    thought to be granaries. </p>
                  <p class="text">Although the Oak Hill Village deserves a full TBH site exhibit, a few tantalizing details are presented below and in the accompanying photographs, based on the work of the archeologists who analyzed and reported the Oak Hill Village, 
                    Robert Rogers and Timothy K. Perttula, and their colleagues.</p>
                  <p class="text">The main construction timber used throughout 
                    the life of the Oak Hill villages was oak. There is no evidence 
                    that any of the buildings were burned, suggesting that they 
                    decayed naturally after use life of no more than 15 years. 
                    One technique used to prolong the life of the upright timbers 
                    was to char the ends of the posts that were set into the ground. 
                    Some of the overlapping and intersecting house patterns suggest 
                    that some of the houses were rebuilt using borrowed timbers 
                    (perhaps those that had snapped off at the ground level).</p>
                  <p class="text">Many charred corn cobs were found in several 
                    pits within houses that were either cooking fires or what archeologists 
                    call &quot;smudge pits,&quot; fires intended to produce lots 
                    of smoke either for smoking meat or keeping mosquitoes at 
                    bay. The fragmentary cobs were studied by plant experts (paleobotanists) 
                    who suspect the diverse sample represents as many as three 
                    or four different varieties of corn. Eight, 10, 12, and 14-row forms were found, although the number of rows 
                    is not clearly linked to variety (ears with different numbers 
                    of rows occur within a single variety). While it was not possible 
                    to identify these as known varieties, it does seem likely 
                    that the Oak Hill villagers were growing several different 
                    types of corn. This fits with early historic accounts that 
                    describe the Hasinai groups growing an early maturing flint 
                    corn and a later maturing flour corn. You can see the advantage 
                    of having varieties that could be grown at different times 
                    of the year and those that would tolerate drought better.</p>
                  <p class="text">The 300-year span of the successive Oak Hill 
                    villages illustrates nicely the increasing importance of corn. 
                    Corn was found in 32% of the Early Village soil samples from 
                    hearths and pits, 50% of the Middle Village samples, and 97% 
                    of the Late Village samples. The Late Village granaries reinforce 
                    these data. The village economy, though, depended on a mix 
                    of crops, wild plants, and wild animals throughout the site's 
                    history. Hickory nuts are present in almost every sample. 
                    Other nuts include acorns and walnuts. Fruits that were eaten 
                    include persimmons, dewberries, and grapes. The finding of 
                    charred maygrass and goosefoot/pigweed indicates that these 
                    starchy seeded weeds were probably grown (or encouraged) as 
                    well. Deer was the hunter's favorite target and the main protein 
                    source. Other hunted or trapped animals include rabbits, buffalo 
                    (a single animal), and squirrel. Fish, birds, and reptiles 
                    round out the list and that is only what was preserved. Dozens 
                    of other plant and animal species would have been part of 
                    the diet.</p> <div align="center"><a href="late.html"><img src="../../images/arrowbig.gif" alt="Follow Caddo History" width="236" height="42" border="0"></a>
