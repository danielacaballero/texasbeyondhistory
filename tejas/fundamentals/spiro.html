                          made for use at Cahokia. Their hypothesis is that this 
                          and similar ritual items left Cahokia in the late 13th 
                          century as the center's power waned to be reused at

                  <p class="text">Just to the north of the main Caddo Homeland 
                    lies the mound center of <strong>Spiro</strong> in the Arkansas River 
                    valley in extreme eastern Oklahoma. Spiro was the westernmost 
                    of the primate (main) centers in the Mississippian world during 
                    the 12th through mid-15th centuries (A.D. 1100-1450). Spiro 
                    was certainly not anywhere near as large or powerful as Cahokia, 
                    the largest town and political capital in prehistoric America 
                    north of Mexico. But Spiro is famous for the unprecedented 
                    amount of wealth that was accumulated by its leaders and buried 
                    with them. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1933, local entrepreneurs formed the &quot;Pocola 
                    Mining Company&quot; to loot <strong>Craig Mound</strong>, the site's 
                    largest mound. Craig Mound was actually four connected mounds, 
                    a large cone-shaped one and three smaller ones. Digging by 
                    hand with no real idea of what they were digging into, the 
                    looters made relatively slow progress for the first year. 
                    They did encountered many graves and offerings in the smaller 
                    mounds and these began to appear on the market. This eventually 
                    provoked a public outcry and Oklahoma passed one of the first 
                    state laws protecting antiquities in 1935. Unfortunately, 
                    the looters were able to continue digging secretly and finally 
                    struck upon an effective way of getting what they wanted: 
                    they hired coal miners to tunnel into the largest cone.</p>
                  <p class="text">The main tunnel into the center of the mound 
                    encountered a gaping hollow, the shell of a purposefully buried 
                    mortuary building. Inside were elaborate special burials and 
                    jumbled human bones accompanied by unbelievable quantities 
                    of unusual artifacts made of marine shell, exotic stone, bone, 
                    copper, feathers, fabrics, fur, and all manner of materials. 
                    Many of these items represent ritual paraphernalia linked 
                    to the Southern Cult (Southeastern Ceremonial Complex).</p>
                  <p class="text">As their lease expired and as state authorities 
                    moved to shut down the operation, the Pocola miners tried 
                    to blow up the rest of the mound in a fit of pique. Although 
                    they failed, the damage they had already wrought is one of 
                    the greatest tragedies in American archeology. The whole and 
                    partial artifacts were quickly sold off and wound up in dozens 
                    of museums and private collections around the country. The 
                    1936-1941 WPA archeological excavations by the University 
                    of Oklahoma salvaged many pieces and much information. More 
                    recent work at the site and thorough analyses of the spectacular 
                    collections have made Spiro one of the most important archeological 
                    sites in North America.</p>
                  <p class="text">Spiro was not an isolated place, but was instead 
                    at the top of a hierarchy of settlements within the <strong>Arkansas 
                    Basin</strong>&#151;west and north up the Arkansas River and its 
                    tributaries draining the southwestern Ozark Plateau and adjacent 
                    tall-prairies to the west. Related sites are said to occur 
                    within the White River drainage in southernmost Missouri. 
                    During the <strong>Harlan phase</strong> (A.D. 1000-1250), Spiro was 
                    a ceremonial and population center. After A.D. 1250, the residential 
                    population moved to other sites in the area and Spiro was 
                    used only as ceremonial and mortuary center. The site's role 
                    as a mortuary center peaked in the <strong>Norman</strong> and <strong>Spiro 
                    phases</strong> (A.D. 1250-1350 and 1350-1450, respectively). After 
                    A.D. 1450, the site ceased to play an important role in the 
                    region, possibly because east-west trade routes shifted southward 
                    through the Red River valley.</p>
                  <p class="text">Spiro's wealth is almost certainly a consequence 
                    of its strategic position as a <strong>gateway community </strong>and 
                    trading center between the Mississippian world to the east 
                    and the Great Plains to the west. Spiro is thought to have 
                    served in much the same way as did St Louis, Missouri in the 
                    18th and 19th centuries: as a crucial hub through which most 
                    east-west commerce and traffic had to pass. In Spiro's case, 
                    the nature and substance of the trade is debated. Some argue 
                    that Spiro was at the center of a trade system that moved 
                    relatively large quantities of economically useful materials 
                    including food, clothing, and weapons. In contrast, other 
                    scholars think that Spiro trade amounted mainly to exchanges 
                    between leaders of ritual items related to the Southern Cult. 
                    The view here is that Spiro trade almost certainly had both 
                    economic and ritual importance.</p>
                  <p class="text">At Spiro, most of the <strong>exotic materials</strong> 
                    come either from the local region (including the main Caddo 
                    Homeland to the south) or from distant sources far to the 
                    east. Among the distant sources are those in the Midwest around 
                    Cahokia and across the Southeast, including the Appalachian 
                    Mountains (Tennessee-Kentucky area) and the northeastern Gulf 
                    coast (Florida-Mississippi). It is somewhat less clear what 
                    was moving from the opposite direction from the Great Plains 
                    that would attract this great wealth from the Eastern Woodlands. 
                    Grave145 in Craig Mound had strings of shell beads that had 
                    a total of almost 14,000 beads made from dwarf olive shells 
                    from the Gulf of California. Some of the garments found at 
                    Spiro are made of bison hair, jack rabbit fur, and cotton 
                    fiber. These hint that most of what was moving west-to-east 
                    may have been of perishable material. </p>
                  <p class="text">Frank Schambach argues that dried bison meat 
                    and bison hides were the principal items moving east from 
                    the Plains. Further, he believes that Spiro also controlled 
                    the trade in bois d'arc wood and finished bows obtained from 
                    the Red River valley in the core of the Caddo Homeland. Bows 
                    and bow wood would have been highly desirable to both the 
                    bison hunters on the Plains as well as the warriors and hunters 
                    of the Mississippian world to the east.</p>
                  <p class="text">This brings us back to the question of who the 
                    Spiroans were and how they relate to the Caddo groups along 
                    the Red River and elsewhere in the main Caddo Homeland. Although 
                    Spiro and its Arkansas Basin hinterland has long been known 
                    to archeologists as the &quot;Northern Caddoan Area,&quot; 
                    <strong>the ethnic/linguistic identity of the Spiroans is debated</strong>. 
                    The four possibilities that have been advanced include: the 
                    ancestors of the Caddo, Kitsai, Wichita, and Tunica.</p>
                  <p class="text">The main reason the debate lingers is because 
                    of the break in the cultural sequence of the Arkansas Basin. 
                    Following the demise of Spiro as an important center by A.D. 
                    1450, the succeeding <strong>Ft. Coffee phase</strong> (A.D. 1450-1650?) 
                    is said to evidence some cultural continuity with Spiro's 
                    heyday but also changes, such as a shift to circular houses 
                    (from rectangular). Other changes, such as the use of underground 
                    storage pits, are said to reflect a western orientation toward 
                    the Plains. While most authorities think the main east-west 
                    trade routes shifted south through the central part of the 
                    Caddo Homeland, Schambach argues the Spiro area still served 
                    as a gateway community after the demise of the site as a major 
                    center. </p>
                  <p class="text">By the time French traders entered that part 
                    of the Arkansas Valley in 1719, Spiro was long abandoned and 
                    the area was essentially unoccupied. Farther up the Arkansas 
                    River the French found villages and camps of Wichita and Kitsai 
                    groups, both speakers of Northern Caddoan languages. Yet, 
                    the lifestyle of these peoples as observed by the French was 
                    very different from that of the Spiroans. Were these Northern 
                    Caddoan peoples the descendants of the Spiroans? And what 
                    about the strange people of the province known as Tula that 
                    the De Soto expedition encountered in 1542 somewhere along 
                    the lower or middle Arkansas River?</p>
                  <p class="text">Parallels between the Arkansas Basin and the 
                    Caddo Homeland to the south have caused generations of archeologists 
                    to believe that the two areas are part of the same <strong>&quot;Caddoan&quot; 
                    cultural tradition</strong>. This interpretation was built partly 
                    on the finding at Spiro of many finely engraved pots, particularly 
                    of the style named Spiro Engraved, during the WPA excavations 
                    there in 1936-1941. Since the engraved pots are clearly of 
                    the Caddo ceramic tradition and it was assumed that they were 
                    made at Spiro, then Spiro was seen as being part of the Caddo 
                    tradition. But it is now recognized that many of these Caddo-like 
                    pots at Spiro are indeed Caddo pots that come from the main 
                    Caddo Homeland, not the Arkansas Basin. Spiro Engraved, for 
                    instance, was almost certainly manufactured in the valley 
                    of Red River. This realization has done little to alter the 
                    notion that Spiro was part of the Caddo tradition. </p>
                  <p class="text">The combined region and culture has been called, 
                    variously, the Caddoan Area, the Caddoan Cultural Tradition, 
                    and the Caddoan Mississippian culture based on the assumption 
                    that the entire area was populated by the ancestors of Caddo-speaking 
                    groups. But the obvious dissimilarities (including different 
                    mortuary practices, different dominant house forms, and distinctive 
                    skeletal characteristics) have led to uncertainty about this 
                    all-Caddo notion. Despite many similarities, the <strong>Arkansas 
                    Basin cultures were distinct from those in the main Caddo 
                    Homeland for at least 600-800 years</strong> (roughly A.D. 800-1600). 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Some archeologists believe the parallels between 
                    the two adjacent areas are more important than the differences. 
                    They point to the fact that within the main Caddo homeland 
                    itself there is considerable diversity from local area to 
                    local area. Archeologist Ann Early, who has worked extensively 
                    in the Ouachita Mountains, sees many similarities between 
                    Caddo sites in that area and those in the Arkansas Basin. 
                    For instance, square and rectangular structures (often temples 
                    or other special buildings) are common at Late Caddo sites 
                    in the Ouachita Mountains. (Rectangular buildings are also 
                    found widely farther south in east Texas, but they are vastly 
                    outnumbered by circular structures.) Early and other archeologists 
                    hypothesize that, after the demise of Spiro as a major population 
                    and ritual center in the mid-15th century, the local (presumably 
                    Caddo-speaking) people may have begun migrating south and 
                    east into the nearby Ouachita Mountains.</p>
                  <p class="text">Or perhaps, as some archeologists have argued, 
                    the Spiroans were the ancestors of one of the tribes that 
                    are closely linguistically related to the Caddo. The <strong>Kitsai 
                    </strong>and <strong>Wichita</strong> have been singled out as the most likely 
                    candidates, but not very convincingly so. If these groups 
                    were the descendants of Arkansas Basin peoples, why were their 
                    cultures so different in so many important ways from that 
                    of Spiro? For instance, the Wichita were known throughout 
                    historic times for their round, beehive-shaped grass houses 
                    quite similar to those characteristic of the early historic 
                    Caddo. Yet, Spiro houses were square or rectangular with four- 
                    or two-post central roof supports and an extended entranceway, 
                    a very different architectural tradition. Similarly, Wichita 
                    pottery seems to have been part of the Plains tradition of 
                    cord-marked utilitarian wares, not the engraved fine wares 
                    of the Caddo tradition. </p>
                  <p class="text">Oklahoma archeologists Charles Rohrbaugh and 
                    Don Wyckoff think a better case may be made for the Kitsai. 
                    They see parallels between the post-Spiro Fort Coffee phase 
                    (ca. A.D. 1450-1600) in the Arkansas Valley and historic village 
                    sites along the Grand River that have been linked to the Kitsai. 
                    Unfortunately, so little is known for sure about the history 
                    of the Kitsai that the Spiro-Kitsai hypothesis has yet to 
                    be confirmed.</p>
                  <p class="text">The most controversial (and intriguing) suggestion 
                    is that the Spiroans were neither Caddo nor Caddoan, but the 
                    ancestors of the <strong>Tunica tribe</strong> of the lower Mississippi 
                    Valley. Frank Schambach's hypothesis is that the province 
                    of <strong>Tula</strong> that De Soto's army attacked in 1542 was at 
                    or near Spiro and that the Tulans were one and the same as 
                    the archeologically known Spiroans. He argues that the descendants 
                    of the Spiroans are the Tunica. From the late 1600s onward 
                    the curious history of the Tunica is well known. The Tunica 
                    were closely allied trading partners with the French and served 
                    as middlemen through which guns and trade goods moved west 
                    in exchange for horses, furs, and hides. They were unequivocally 
                    identified first in the late 1600s on the lower Yazoo River, 
                    just upstream from where the Arkansas meets the Mississippi. 
                    From there they repeatedly moved their villages down the Mississippi 
                    in response to epidemics and trading opportunities. </p>
                  <p class="text">Schambach's full argument is too complex and 
                    lengthy to be presented here. Basically, he thinks the Tunica 
                    were far more than mere middlemen and were active long-distance 
                    traders who operated a vast trading network during the 18th 
                    century that linked the Southern Plains, the Caddo Homeland, 
                    and the lower Mississippi. This network is said to represent 
                    a continuation or evolution of the one established 600 years 
                    earlier by the ancient Spiroans. Part of the evidence involves 
                    a peculiar type of cranial deformation caused by binding the 
                    heads of infants such that their heads became pointed. The 
                    deformed heads of the people of Tula horrified the Spanish 
                    in 1542. Archeologically this trait is said to be present 
                    at Spiro and at the Sanders site on the Red River, which Schambach 
                    argues was a subsidiary trading center linked to Spiro. It 
                    has yet to be established that the Tunica had this particular 
                    form of deformation, although one French account may suggest 
                    that this was so. Schambach speculates that these grotesque 
                    heads would have given the traders instant recognition, an 
                    advantage when traveling through the territories of other 
                    groups. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>While the Tunica hypothesis is fascinating, 
                    it based on a string of tentative inferences that may not 
                    withstand rigorous analysis.</strong> Schambach's argument has 
                    not won over the leading researchers who have worked in the 
                    Arkansas Basin. They apparently reject the idea entirely, 
                    but have yet to counter the argument forcefully in print. 
                    The Tunica hypothesis is also rejected out of hand by the 
                    Caddo and Wichita tribes; both tribes claim Spiro as part 
                    of their ancestral realm. </p>
                  <p class="text">And here is where we will leave the questions 
                    of who the Spiroans were and whether the Arkansas Basin is 
                    truly part of the Caddo Homeland. Unresolved. <strong>The view 
                    here is that the problem is a fascinating and important one 
                    worthy of additional research.</strong> Schambach's challenge to 
                    the status quo is a very serious one that should be considered 
                    carefully by Spiro scholars, not rejected out of hand. If 
                    a better case can be made for the Kitsai (or the Wichita or 
                    the Caddo), then it should be made with stronger arguments 
                    and better data than has been presented so far. That said, 
                    there may never be enough evidence of the sort needed to make 
                    definitive links between the people who lived at Spiro 600 
                    years ago and living peoples. </p>
                  <p class="text">Two things are clear regarding the history of 
                    the Caddo peoples. One is that <strong>the Arkansas Basin and the 
                    main Caddo Homeland were home to substantially different groups 
                    of people, </strong>whether they shared a common ancestry or not. 
                    If the prehistoric peoples of the Arkansas Basin were Caddo-speakers 
                    or speakers of one of the Northern Caddoan languages, they 
                    split from the southern Caddo groups over 1200 years ago. 
                    The other, equally important point is that <strong>the two areas 
                    were linked through shared cultural elements and trade for 
                    at least 800 years.</strong> There is little or no evidence of 
                    conflict between the peoples of the two areas and much evidence 
                    of trade and the exchange of ideas.</p>
