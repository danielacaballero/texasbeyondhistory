            <p class="text">The historically known Caddo and their direct ancestors 
              appear to have lived in the same area for over 3,000 years, perhaps 
              even 4,000 years or longer. This statement is based on linguistic 
              inferences reviewed in <a href="languages.html" class="text">Caddoan 
              Languages and Peoples</a>, on extensive archeological evidence (see 
              <a href="../ancestors/index.html" class="text">Caddo Ancestors</a>), 
              on the observations of early European explorers, and, to some extent, 
              on Caddo oral tradition. The main Caddo Homeland, as we will call 
              the area throughout the Tejas exhibits, stretched for about 300 
              miles (480 kilometers) north-south and 220 miles (355 kilometers) 
              east-west, a vast territory of about 51,830 square miles (134,235) 
              square kilometers) within which over 150 generations of Caddo peoples 
              lived and died. The coming of the Europeans and their germs, guns, 
              horses, and ambitions severed a truly remarkable long-term relationship 
              between a people and their land. </p>
            <p class="text">All of the historically known groups who spoke dialects 
              of the Caddo language lived within the main Caddo Homeland as we 
              see it here. The Caddo Homeland may have once stretched northward 
              into the Arkansas Basin as far as the southern Ozarks in northwestern 
              Arkansas and southernmost Missouri. While archeologists have long 
              referred to this area as the &quot;Northern Caddoan Area&quot; the 
              ethnic identity of the people of Spiro and its hinterland is debated. 
              If the prehistoric people of that area were among the ancestors 
              of the modern Caddo, they had abandoned the area and moved southward 
              by the 16th or early 17th century, if not before. Alternatively, 
              the Arkansas Basin may have been home to the ancestors of the speakers 
              of one of the Northern Caddoan languages (Kitsai or Wichita) or 
              even, as has been suggested, to a completely unrelated ethnic group, 
              the Tunica. The map above shows the Arkansas Basin in dashed line 
              to indicate the continued uncertainty. See <a href="spiro.html" class="text">Spiro 
              and the Arkansas Basin</a> for a more complete discussion.</p>
            <h3>Caddo Homeland Described</h3>
            <p class="text">The greater Caddo Homeland (including the Arkansas 
              Basin) can be explored through the interactive <a href="../map/index.html" class="text">Caddo 
              Map Tool</a>. Here we provide an overview of the area and discuss 
              certain points not accessible through the map tool. Many of the 
              images shown here can also be accessed through the map tool, which 
              also contains many other images.</p>
            <p class="text">The <strong>main Caddo Homeland</strong> lies south of the Arkansas 
              River valley and is roughly bounded on the north by the northern 
              flank of the Ouachita Mountains and on the west by the Blackland 
              Prairie. These are ecological boundaries, not physical barriers. 
              Likewise, the southern boundary seems to coincide with the belt 
              of deep sands that flanks the inner edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain. 
              These sands are not productive for agriculture and effectively prevented 
              the Caddo from expanding to the south. To the east is the Lower 
              Mississippi Valley. Whether bounded by natural features or not, 
              the edges of the Caddo Homeland would have been defined, in part, 
              by the presence of non-Caddo groups.</p>
            <p class="text">To the north of the main Caddo Homeland is the <strong>Arkansas 
              Basin</strong> area, which includes the Arkansas River Valley from western 
              Arkansas into eastern Oklahoma and adjacent areas mainly to the 
              north. Archeological sites thought to be related to the Caddoan 
              tradition are found a short distance west of Spiro out into the 
              Cross-Timbers and Bluestem Prairies along the Arkansas River and 
              its westward and northward tributaries, including the Canadian, 
              Grand, and Neosho rivers. Also included is the southern part of 
              the Ozark Highlands including the Boston Mountains, which provide 
              some of the greatest topographic relief found in the region. This 
              part of the Ozark Highlands has relatively small streams and rivers 
              that drain southward or westward into the Arkansas and Grand rivers, 
              as well as the upper part of the White River drainage, which flows 
              to the northeast. </p>
            <p class="text">Returning to the main Caddo Homeland, the landscape 
              of its northern part is dominated by the <strong>Ouachita Mountains</strong>. 
              Streams and rivers in the north are relatively fast-running and 
              clear and flow within narrow valleys. The broad valley of the upper 
              Ouachita River is an exception. South of the Ouachita Mountains, 
              the Caddo Homeland is a gently rolling terrain dominated by forests 
              interrupted only by rivers flowing eastward or southeastward toward 
              the Mississippi or south toward the Gulf of Mexico. With minor exception, 
              the entire Caddo Homeland is forested, although today the forests 
              are highly fragmented and all areas with productive soils have been 
              cleared for agriculture or pasture at one time or another. The often-broad 
              river valleys provided flat bottomland expanses with fertile soils 
              that were favored by Caddo farmers. </p>
            <p class="text">Within the Ouachita Mountains, the Ouachita River 
              has numerous tributaries, including the <strong>Caddo</strong> and <strong>Little 
              Missouri rivers</strong>. Another tributary, the <strong>Saline River</strong> 
              lies farther east beyond the Ouachita Mountains and is the easternmost 
              drainage reached by ancient Caddo settlement. Numerous streams and 
              small rivers draining the southern and southwestern flanks of the 
              Ouachitas flow southward and join the Red River including the Little 
              and Kiamichi rivers. The <strong>Kiamichi River</strong> is notable because 
              its narrow valley was a natural transportation route between the 
              Red River Caddo and Spiro. Unlike almost all other drainages in 
              the Caddo Homeland, the Kiamichi flows west before turning south 
              to join the Red River. </p>
            <p class="text">The <strong>Red River</strong> is the central feature of the 
              Caddo Homeland and its largest river. Throughout Caddo history and 
              prehistory, the Red River valley from Lamar County, Texas to just 
              below Natchitoches, Louisiana, was the setting for many of the most 
              impressive cultural developments, including many of the earliest, 
              largest, and latest villages and ceremonial centers. The wide Red 
              River floodplain is dissected by meander scars marking abandoned 
              channels where the river once flowed. These abandoned channels often 
              become oxbow or &quot;cutoff&quot; lakes, and rich sources of aquatic 
              resources. The floodplain was ideal for Caddo farmers, offering 
              natural clearings and deep, rich soils in stark contrast with the 
              poor upland soils of the adjacent forests. </p>
            <p class="text">In many ways the Red River was the heartland of the 
              ancient Caddo world. Initially, this was, in part, because the Red 
              River linked the Caddo Homeland with the lower Mississippi Valley 
              (LMV) to the southeast and the prairie-plains to the west. The Red 
              River is, in fact, the last (southernmost) western tributary of 
              the mighty Mississippi. The confluence of the Red River and the 
              Mississippi figured prominently throughout the very long cultural 
              history of the LMV. In particular, several of the largest and most 
              important Middle Woodland centers of Marksville culture (200 B.C. 
              to A.D. 500) were located at the ancient confluence of the Red River 
              and Mississippi. This is worth noting because the Marksville culture 
              seems to have influenced Woodland cultures in the Caddo Homeland.</p>
            <p class="text">But by around A.D. 1000 or shortly thereafter, the 
              Red River was blocked by the initial formation of the massive logjam 
              known in historic times as the <strong>Great Raft</strong>. This raft built 
              up over the next 800 years. In the early 1700s, a French trading 
              party led by La Harpe needed 26 days to travel 108 leagues (298 
              miles) by canoe from Natchitoches to the mouth of the Sulphur River. 
              The blockage of this natural transportation route at about the same 
              time that the distinct Caddo cultural tradition developed (ca. A.D. 
              1000), probably helps explain why there is comparatively little 
              evidence for extensive interaction between the LMV peoples and Caddo 
              peoples during the Mississippian period.</p>
            <p class="text">In northeast Texas, south and west from the Red River, 
              Caddo groups lived in and near the valleys of the many rivers and 
              streams. From north to south the main drainages include the <strong>Sulphur 
              River</strong>, <strong>Big Cypress Creek</strong>, the <strong>Sabine River</strong>, the<strong> 
              Neches River</strong>, and the <strong>Angelina River</strong>. Bottomland plant 
              communities along these watercourses included hardwood and swamp 
              forests, with natural levees, point bar deposits, old stream channels, 
              oxbow lakes, and backwater swamps forming diverse environments and 
              natural resources.</p>
            <p class="text"> Northeast Texas has three main biotic communities: 
              the <strong>Post Oak Savanna</strong> or Oak Woodlands, the <strong>Blackland Prairie</strong>, 
              and the <strong>Pineywoods</strong>. The Caddo lived mainly within the modern 
              distribution of the Pineywoods and the Post Oak Savanna, occasionally 
              traveling west beyond the tall-grass Blackland Prairie to hunt bison. 
              (Buffalo eat short grasses.) The Post Oak Savanna is a narrow southwest 
              to northeast trending woodland belt that marks a natural transition 
              zone or ecotone between the drier Blackland Prairie to the west 
              and the moister Pineywoods to the east. Both the Post Oak Savanna 
              and the Pineywoods have medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous 
              forests, and shortleaf and loblolly pines are common in the Pineywoods 
              on upland fine sandy loam soils with adequate moisture. Small areas 
              of tall grass prairie may be present in both communities throughout 
              the region. </p>
            <p class="text">The <strong>southwestern Caddo Homeland </strong>is the only 
              area that is not part of the Red River and Mississippi drainage 
              system. The Sabine, Neches, and Angelina rivers are part of the 
              Sabine watershed. The Sabine empties into the Gulf of Mexico almost 
              300 miles west of the mouth of the Mississippi. The Neches and Angelina 
              river valleys were occupied in Woodland times by the Mossy Grove 
              culture, whereas the Fourche Maline culture flourished along the 
              Red River and its many tributaries. By A.D. 800, Caddo groups appear 
              to have moved into the upper and middle Sabine drainage. It is not 
              clear whether the Mossy Grove peoples were displaced or assimilated 
              (or both) into Caddo culture. During the early historic period, 
              the southeastern Caddo Homeland was the territory of the Hasinai 
              Caddo groups, while to the south were non-Caddo groups such as the 
              Bidai, Atakapa, and Ais, who may represent the descendants of Mossy 
              Grove culture.</p>
            <p class="text">Throughout the history of humankind, rivers have been 
              the focal point for many cultures and civilizations. The mere mention 
              of rivers such as the Tigress and Euphrates, the Nile, the Danube, 
              and the Amazon conjures up images of the distinct cultures that 
              arose along side them. Although less well known, the Caddo, too, 
              were intimately linked to the rivers and streams of the Caddo Homeland. 
              Much of Caddo life revolved around the rivers and streams along 
              which they usually lived. The watercourses provided sustenance and 
              floodplain settings for farming; the larger streams and rivers also 
              served as water-borne transportation corridors. River and stream 
              bottoms also provided habitat for a diverse range of useful plants 
              and critters not found in the surrounding pine and oak forests.</p>
            <p class="text">Although most of the Caddo region was (and still is 
              to a lesser extent) heavily wooded and dominated by pine or oak-hickory 
              forests, <strong>the Caddo lived on the edge</strong>. As a farming people, 
              the Caddo sought out natural breaks in the trees rather than trying 
              to clear large areas of the primary forests as Euro-American settlers 
              and their modern descendants have done. Lacking metal tools, the 
              Caddo found it easier to take advantage of natural breaks and edges 
              and slowly enlarge these with traditional tree-felling methods. 
              Stone axes are effective tree-cutting instruments, but the process 
              is slow and labor-intensive. You can see why the Caddo sought out 
              natural breaks such as those along the streams and rivers that were 
              caused by major floods. </p>
            <p class="text">Other common localities for settlement were natural 
              (and man-made) prairies, which occur as major landscape features 
              along the western edge of the Caddo Homeland as well as small, isolated 
              <strong>&quot;pocket&quot; prairies</strong> that occur within the forests 
              south of the Ozarks. Some of the pocket prairies within the forests 
              probably began as natural features, but others were almost certainly 
              man-made clearings created and maintained by the Caddo through regular 
              burning. Such openings would have been necessary for farming and, 
              perhaps critically, to provide the large quantities of tall grass 
              that the Caddo needed for the thick thatch roofs of their houses.</p>
            <p class="text">Accounts from the 18th and early 19th centuries describe 
              pocket prairies along the Red River as grasslands sometimes a mile 
              or more in extent with scattered shrubs and bois d'arc trees. These 
              are not like the extensive Blackland Prairies located on the western 
              edge of the Caddo Homeland and found in smaller remnant patches 
              such as those along the Little River in southwest Arkansas. Early 
              Anglo settlers often encountered long-abandoned Caddo settlements 
              on the edges of prairies and gave them names such as &quot;Mound 
              Prairie&quot; and &quot;Caddo Prairie.&quot; Battle Mound, the largest 
              earthen mound constructed by the Caddo, was located near Chickaninny 
              Prairie, a name that is derived from the Caddo word &quot;Chakanina&quot; 
              meaning &quot;the place of crying.&quot; This place name figures 
              prominently in several of the origin stories told by the Cadohadacho 
              in the 19th century. </p>
            <p class="text">Within the main Caddo Homeland, the area with the 
              richest mineral and rock deposits prized by the Caddo is the <strong>Ouachita 
              Mountains</strong>. Artifacts made of novaculite, flint, quartz, shale, 
              sandstone, and various other metamorphic rocks from the Ouachitas 
              are found in Caddo sites hundreds of miles to the southeast. Some 
              minerals, especially clay and hematite (red ochre), but also sandstone 
              and fossilized wood, do occur widely in the non-mountainous areas 
              of the homeland. As you go south into the Gulf coastal plain, rocks 
              and minerals are scarce.</p>
            <p class="text">The <strong>climate</strong> of the Caddo Homeland is classified 
              as subtropical humid, meaning that it is relatively warm and wet 
              and has relatively long growing seasons and hot summers. But there 
              are significant climatic differences across the region. Most rain 
              falls in the spring and fall. The average annual rainfall increases 
              west to east from below 35&quot; on the western edge to 51&quot; 
              on the eastern edge and even higher in eastern parts of the Ouachita 
              Mountains. Average temperature increases north to south from 61.5 
              F in the Ouachitas to 67 F at the southern edge of the Caddo Homeland. 
              Most critically, the average number of frost-free days ranges from 
              less than 200 in the higher parts of the Ouachitas to more than 
              250 in the southern part of the region. For the Caddo, this meant 
              that groups living south of the Ouachitas could harvest two corn 
              crops per year, a decided advantage to people who depended on corn.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Droughts</strong> are not uncommon, and tree ring data 
              for the last 1000 years suggest there were numerous prolonged wet 
              and dry periods lasting years or even decades. Dry conditions and 
              the worst droughts occurred in the late A.D. 1200s, in the mid-1400s 
              and 1600s, and then again in the mid-1700s. The period between A.D. 
              1549-1577 is thought to have had the worst June droughts (a critical 
              period for corn farmers) in the past 450 years. Another significant 
              drought period occurred between ca. A.D. 1450-1490. More favorable 
              crop growing conditions probably occurred during the intervening 
              years, especially between ca. A.D. 1390-1440, then in the latter 
              part of the 16th century and early 17th century, and finally, at 
              the beginning of the 18th century when Spanish and French colonists 
              settled among the Caddo peoples in earnest. These climatic fluctuations 
              would have affected the predictability and success of the maize 
              harvests and impacted the histories of Caddo communities, especially 
              those living in the drier western half of the Caddo Homeland.</p>
