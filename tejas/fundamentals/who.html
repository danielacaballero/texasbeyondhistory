                  <p class="text">Today the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma has some 
                    4,000 members on its official tribal roll. The tribal headquarters 
                    is in Binger, Oklahoma, about 45 miles west of Oklahoma City. 
                    It was here, in and around the towns of Anadarko, Binger, 
                    and Fort Cobb, that the Caddo settled during and after the 
                    Civil War. This final relocation was preceded by over a century 
                    of turmoil during which Caddo groups were forced to give up 
                    their home territories in northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana, 
                    southwest Arkansas, and southeast Oklahoma. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today's Caddo are the descendants of many distinct 
                    communities of people who shared much of a common culture. 
                    In the late 1600s and early 1700s, Spanish and French chroniclers 
                    familiar with the Caddo homeland recorded the names of at 
                    least 25 separate groups who spoke dialects of the language 
                    known today as Caddo. Beyond speaking the same basic language, 
                    these groups were linked by many shared customs, a similar 
                    way of life, and by intermarriage. </p>
                  <p class="text">Because of population loss and enemy encroachment, 
                    most Caddo groups eventually organized themselves into the 
                    Hasinai, Cadohadacho (also spelled Kadohadacho), and Natchitoches 
                    alliances (often called &quot;confederacies&quot;). Group 
                    consolidation took place in the Neches and Angelina river 
                    valleys in east Texas (the Hasinai, comprised of the Hainia and other groups), the Great Bend area of 
                    the Red River (the Cadohadacho), and in the vicinity of the 
                    French post of Natchitoches, Louisiana. The Hasinai Caddo 
                    continued to live through the 1830s in their traditional east 
                    Texas homeland, while the Natchitoches did the same in western 
                    Louisiana. But the Cadohadacho were forced to move west and south of 
                    the Red River in the late 1780s, to the Caddo Lake area, along 
                    the boundary between the U.S. territory of Louisiana and the 
                    Mexican province of Texas. Some Cadohadacho stayed there until 
                    about 1842, at the village of <a href="../../timberhill/index.html" class="text">Sha'chahdinnih 
                    or Timber Hill</a> and several other poorly known villages.</p>
                  <p class="text">When Europeans first arrived, the Caddo were 
                    settled, farming people who grew corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, 
                    and other crops and lived in farmsteads, hamlets, and villages 
                    dispersed along streams and rivers that mainly flow to the 
                    east and south through their homeland. Within this area the 
                    forested Eastern Woodlands met the grasslands and savannas 
                    that fringed the Great Plains farther to the west. Culturally, 
                    the Caddo were the westernmost of the Indian societies of 
                    the Southeastern United States, but their closest linguistic 
                    and blood relatives were the Caddoan-speaking tribes of the 
                    Southern and Central Plains: the Wichita, Kitsai, Pawnee, 
                    and Arikara.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the period from about 340 to 1000 years ago (A.D. 1000-1680), the Caddo, like 
                    other Southeastern cultures, had &quot;ranked&quot; societies 
                    with at least two social classes topped by the kin of the 
                    hereditary religious and political leaders. Ethnologists sometimes 
                    call such societies &quot;theocratic chiefdoms&quot; and recognize 
                    that politics and religion were not separate domains but interwoven 
                    parts of an intricate way of life. Although most Caddo communities 
                    were scattered, and stretched out along river and stream valleys, 
                    their most important leaders usually lived in or near the 
                    larger villages and ritual centers 
                    where towering temples built of poles and grass thatch stood 
                    atop earthen mounds (see Teran map on left). At sacred 
                    and festive times such as First Harvest and in times of crisis, 
                    the scattered Caddo gathered where their society's leaders 
                    lived.</p>
                  <p class="text">The sprawling communities of the Caddo were 
                    quite different from the compact fortified towns of other 
                    societies along the central and lower Mississippi Valley, 
                    a few days walk to the east. In 1541, the De Soto entrada 
                    (intrusion) found fortified towns along the Mississippi River and 
                    societies engaged in violent and habitual warfare. The Spanish 
                    army sometimes attacked towns defended by well-organized warriors 
                    and surrounded by stout log palisades and ditch works. But 
                    as the Spanish moved farther west into the Caddo Homeland, 
                    they came across open villages that were not fortified. Caddo 
                    communities were protected by the large size of the Caddo 
                    territory, the Caddo's reputation as fierce and skillful warriors, 
                    and their ability to band together in times of crisis. Their 
                    neighbors near and far knew not to enter Caddo territory without 
                    permission unless they were looking for a fight. </p>
                  <p class="text">Another thing that set the Caddo apart from 
                    their neighbors was their extraordinary skill and creativity 
                    as potters. Caddo women (and perhaps some men) made all kinds 
                    of pottery from huge storage jars over three feet high to 
                    tiny bowls smaller than a tea cup made for their children 
                    as well as a variety of other objects including smoking pipes 
                    and earspools. While much of the pottery was made for everyday 
                    use in cooking, storage, and serving, the Caddo fine wares 
                    also served other purposes (ritual and funerary) and are renown for their artistic craftsmanship. 
                    Caddo potters were adept at combining flowing vessel forms 
                    with polished surfaces that were characteristically decorated 
                    with engraved designs. Other vessels had appliqu&eacute;d, 
                    brushed, incised, incisted-punctated or punctated designs, or were left plain. We know 
                    that Caddo pots were valued by neighboring groups because 
                    archeologists have found trade pieces hundreds of miles away 
                    from the Caddo Homeland. In fact, it is the distinctiveness 
                    of Caddo pottery that allows archeologists to trace, if imperfectly, much of 
                    their early history.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddo were also known as traders, famed 
                    for their marvelous bows made of the wood of a tree the French 
                    named <em>bois d'arc</em> (&quot;bow wood,&quot; Osage orange) 
                    and, their trade in salt. This trading 
                    was an important part of Caddo life in the historic 
                    era, as well as hundreds of years before European contact. The Caddo role as traders and, as information brokers, 
                    was partly a consequence of the strategic position of their 
                    territory between the Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley. 
                    In the 17th century, the Spanish in northern Mexico learned 
                    of the populous and prosperous Tejas Nation from the Jumano 
                    Indians decades before Spanish expeditions reached the Caddo 
                    homeland from the west in the 1680s. In the early 18th century French traders 
                    were reportedly living in each of the major Caddo villages 
                    along the Red River to take advantage of the Caddos' strategic 
                    position and reputation as traders and middlemen. Soon large 
                    quantities of deer and buffalo hides, horses and Apache slaves 
                    from the Caddo and their trading partners to the west were 
                    being exchanged for French guns and trade goods.</p>
					
                  <p class="text">The name &quot;Caddo&quot; comes from Cadohadacho, 
                    the name of one of the largest and most powerful groups in 
                    early historic times, a people who lived mainly along the 
                    Red River near its Great Bend. The Cadohadacho and their direct 
                    ancestors had probably been living in the Red River valley for a thousand 
                    years or more. &quot;Cadohadacho&quot; is often said to mean 
                    &quot;true chiefs&quot; with the implication being that these 
                    were the original Caddo, but this is a mistaken notion. (According 
                    to linguist Wallace Chafe, the Caddo word, <em>kaduhd&aacute;&aacute;achu</em>, 
                    is a proper name whose full meaning and origin is lost; the 
                    compound word contains a form of the adjective <em>had&aacute;&aacute;chu</em>, 
                    meaning &quot;sharp.&quot;) Other major Caddo groups have 
                    equally long and distinguished histories, especially the Hasinai 
                    groups who lived to the south in the  Neches and Angelina 
                    rivers basins in what is today east Texas. In fact, the Caddo groups 
                    only became one people called the Caddo, after the mid-1800s, 
                    when remnants of the many named groups united to save their 
                    shared identity. Even today many Caddo people trace their 
                    ancestry to one branch of the tribe or another.</p>
                  <p class="text">Sorting out the various Caddo &quot;branches&quot; 
                    is complicated and possible only to a limited degree. Over 
                    the centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans, Caddo groups 
                    had split apart from one another with &quot;daughter&quot; 
                    communities breaking apart from &quot;mother&quot; communities 
                    when moving into new territories in search of better farmland 
                    and less crowding. The use of the terms mother and daughter 
                    communities seems particularly appropriate because Caddo societies 
                    traced their ancestry primarily through their mother's family. 
                    In times of crisis, such as when enemies attacked, the most 
                    closely related (and nearby) groups banded together into temporary 
                    alliances identified with the strongest or principal social 
                    group, which was often the older, mother community. The Cadohadacho 
                    and Hasinai were the main groups who led the largest and most 
                    influential alliances encountered by the Spanish and French, 
                    while the Anadarko or Nadaco were another such unit. (These 
                    are often misleadingly called &quot;confederacies,&quot; a 
                    term which implies a more formal union than was the case; 
                    Caddo alliances were fluid and could be temporary.)</p>
					
                  <p class="text">The 1942 map by ethnologist John Swanton shows 
                    the approximate locations of some of the named groups/places 
                    as recorded by the Spanish and French in the early 1700s. 
                    Two principal alliances, the Cadohadacho and the Hasinai, 
                    are shown as living in separate territories with a large intervening 
                    area that appears to be unoccupied. This is, in part, a gap 
                    of information rather than a complete absence of intervening 
                    settlements. Swanton's map shows the areas known to the Europeans. 
                    There is abundant archeological evidence that Caddo groups 
                    were living in most parts of their traditional homeland in 
                    the 16th and 17th centuries, but this settlement dispersion diminished after ca. A.D. 1680-1700. But by the time the Europeans 
                    became familiar with the Caddo groups, many changes and consolidations 
                    had already taken place as the result of the advance spread 
                    of Old World diseases and the encroachment from the east and 
                    north by opportunistic enemies such as the Osage and Chickasaw. 
                    These developments impacted the easternmost Caddo groups first, 
                    which explains why Swanton's map shows only the Cahinnio and 
                    Ouachita villages to the east of the Red River. </p>
