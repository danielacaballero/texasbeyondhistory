                  <p class="text">Oral history, written history, linguistics, 
                    ethnography, ethnohistory, bioanthropology, and archeology 
                    each provide critical clues about the long march of Caddo 
                    history. Here we briefly mention some of the major sources 
                    of knowledge and highlight the strengths and limitations of 
                    each. Sophisticated understandings of the complex and lengthy 
                    history of Caddo peoples can only come through combining sources 
                    of information and checking one against the other.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Oral tradition</strong> remains important to Caddo 
                    people, but the most essential context for maintaining that 
                    tradition&#151;Caddo language&#151;is gravely imperiled. Anthropologists 
                    and linguists have shown that languages and cultures are so 
                    intimately linked that one can hardly exist without the other. 
                    Languages become extinct when children are no longer raised 
                    speaking the mother tongue, and that has been the case with 
                    the Caddo for at least a generation. There are still about 
                    30 fluent Caddo speakers, but none is young. A small nonprofit 
                    foundation, <a href="http://ahalenia.com/kiwat/" target="_blank" class="text">Kiwat 
                    Hasinay</a>, is dedicated to preserving the Caddo language 
                    and encouraging its revival. One of the foundation's projects 
                    has been an effort to create a community-based program to 
                    teach the language to Caddo children. Through such efforts 
                    and through shared stories, song, and dance, Caddo peoples 
                    will continue to pass on important memories of the Caddo past 
                    and present. In doing so they are creating a new living tradition, 
                    a celebration of Caddo history and identity. </p>
                  <p class="text">Caddo oral traditions have entered into the 
                    written record in various ways. Some are known through the 
                    records of <strong>linguists</strong> and ethnographers who have interviewed 
                    Caddo elders and translated their stories. The work of linguists, 
                    those who study the nature and structure of language, is discussed 
                    in the &quot;<a href="languages.html" class="text">Caddoan 
                    Languages and Peoples</a>&quot; section. Linguistics is sometimes 
                    considered a subfield of anthropology and sometimes a separate 
                    field of its own. Unfortunately, only a single linguist, <strong>Wallace 
                    Chafe</strong>, has intensively studied the Caddo language in modern 
                    times and the major results of his work have not been published. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Ethnographers</strong> are anthropologists who 
                    study and describe other cultures by visiting, observing, 
                    and asking questions. The best ethnographers are &quot;participant 
                    observers&quot; who spend extended periods of time living 
                    in the community they are studying and learning the native 
                    language. Unfortunately, by the time ethnographers began visiting 
                    the Caddo in the early 1900s, Caddo society had been radically 
                    altered by historic events. Still, ethnographers and folklorists 
                    such as <strong>George Dorsey</strong> (working in 1903-1904), <strong>John 
                    Swanton </strong>(ca. 1911), and <strong>Elsie Clews Parsons</strong> (1930s) 
                    interviewed Caddo elders who were raised speaking Caddo. Modern 
                    <strong>historians</strong> such as <strong>Cecile Elkins Carter</strong> have 
                    carried on this tradition by interviewing Caddo elders and 
                    recording their recollections and stories.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Ethnohistorians</strong> are anthropologists who 
                    use documentary evidence to glean ethnographic observations 
                    and understandings of aboriginal societies. Their work overlaps 
                    with that of <strong>traditional historians</strong>, but stands apart 
                    because ethnohistorians are more concerned with reconstructing 
                    the nature of aboriginal societies rather than the sequence 
                    of events and the impact of individuals. Historians and ethnohistorians 
                    are both limited by the surviving documents; there are relatively 
                    few early accounts with substantive detail about Caddo life 
                    and Caddo peoples. Still, new documents and new versions of 
                    known documents are still being discovered from time to time 
                    in archives. New insight also can be gained from improved 
                    translations of known documents.</p>
                  <p class="text">The work of <strong>John Swanton</strong>, a student of 
                    the famed ethnographer Franz Boas, is widely regarded as the 
                    most important ethnohistoric study of the Caddo. His 1942 
                    book, <em>Source Material on the History and Ethnology of the 
                    Caddo Indians</em>, combines his own observations with cautious 
                    interpretations of those made by various explorers, missionaries, 
                    soldiers, and more. The eyewitness accounts of early Spanish 
                    and French visitors to the Caddo Homeland are primary sources 
                    of knowledge. Such observations are also often highly biased 
                    and selective, reflecting the prejudices, motives, and abilities 
                    of the observer as much or more than the character of the 
                    observed.</p>
                  <p class="text">Two early chroniclers of Caddo life stand out. 
                    <strong>Henr&iacute; Joutel</strong>, a young Frenchman who survived 
                    La Salle's disastrous colony on the Texas coast, spent four 
                    months traveling through the Caddo Homeland in the spring 
                    and summer of 1687. His remarkable journey included visits 
                    to Hasinai villages in the Neches-Angelina drainages, the 
                    Nasoni village (see &quot;<a href="../../nasoni/index.html" class="text">Upper 
                    Nasoni</a>&quot; exhibit) and others linked to the Cadohadacho 
                    along the Red River, and Cahino villages further east on the 
                    Ouachita. Joutel's journal contains invaluable observations 
                    about the Caddo world as seen by an intelligent observer who 
                    had no real ulterior motive other than to survive. </p>
                  <p class="text">Only a few years later, the Spanish priest, 
                    <strong>Francisco de Jes&uacute;s Maria Casa&ntilde;as</strong>, spent 
                    15 months (1690-1691) living among the Nabedache (the westernmost 
                    Nasinai group) on the Neches River. He was part of the Spanish 
                    expedition that founded the first mission to the Caddo, Mission 
                    San Franciso de las Tejas in present day Houston County, Texas. 
                    Fray Casa&ntilde;as was a devoted priest motivated by the 
                    desire to save heathen souls, but he was also a shrewd observer 
                    who stayed long enough in one place to get a real sense of 
                    the annual cycle of Caddo life. His <em>Relac&iacute;on</em> 
                    was written while in residence at the mission. </p>
                  <p class="text">The primary documents written by Joutel, Casa&ntilde;as, 
                    and many others did not become well known until the 20th century 
                    when professional historians began translating and studying 
                    these sources. Famed historian <strong>Herbert Eugene Bolton</strong> 
                    became interested in the Hasinai Caddo in 1906 and studied 
                    many of the primary documents on and off over the next several 
                    decades. Regrettably, his manuscript on the Hasinai was not 
                    published until 1987, long after his death in 1953 and at 
                    least 50 years after it was written. Apparently he was never 
                    satisfied with what amounted to an ethnohistorical study. 
                    As a consequence, Bolton's work did not have the impact it 
                    would have had, had it been published in a timely fashion. 
                    Bolton's posthumous book, <em>The Hasinais: Southern Caddoans 
                    as Seen by the Earliest Europeans</em>, covers much of the 
                    same material presented in a similarly titled 1954 study by 
                    <strong>William J. Griffith</strong>, <em>The Hasinai Indians of East 
                    Texas as Seen by Europeans, 1687-1772</em>. Late in life, Bolton 
                    encouraged Griffith's work, apparently believing that his 
                    own would never be published. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the last few decades a number of historians 
                    and archeologists have published historical accounts of Caddo 
                    peoples. These include traditional historians such as <strong>Todd 
                    Smith</strong> and <strong>David LeVere</strong> and historically minded 
                    archeologists such as <strong>Kathleen Gilmore</strong>, <strong>George Sabo</strong>, 
                    and <strong>Timothy K. Perttula</strong>, as well as several historians 
                    who are also members of the Caddo tribe. <em>Hasinai: A Traditional 
                    History of the Caddo Confederacy</em> by <strong>Vynola Newkumet</strong> 
                    and historian <strong>Howard Meredith</strong> was the first such study 
                    (1988). <strong>Cecile Elkins Carter</strong>'s 1995 book <em>Caddo Indians: 
                    Where We Come From </em>synthesizes history, oral tradition, 
                    and archeology from a Caddo perspective. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Bioanthropologists</strong> (also known as biological 
                    or physical anthropologists) study the skeletal remains from 
                    archeological excavations at Caddo sites. This research domain 
                    has yielded extremely valuable data available through no other 
                    means. By studying human bones, bioanthropologists can look 
                    at the health of individuals and their diet, age, sex, incidence 
                    of disease, and evidence of trauma, such as broken bones. 
                    Some information comes from careful scientific examination 
                    and measurement, but some studies require the destruction 
                    of small samples of bone. Such samples can, for example, be 
                    used for radiocarbon dating and for determining carbon and 
                    nitrogen isotope values, which reflect diet. By comparing 
                    samples from individuals dating to different time periods 
                    and from different areas of the Caddo Homeland, one can examine 
                    broad patterns of health and nutrition. While such studies 
                    have been done very successfully in some parts of the country, 
                    the human remains in the Caddo Homeland are often very poorly 
                    preserved or completely destroyed by acidic soils.</p>
                  <p class="text">From a scientific perspective, studies of human 
                    remains can be very informative. But many Caddos and other 
                    Native Americans feel very strongly that any disturbance of 
                    their ancestors' graves is wrong. Some view archeological 
                    excavations of graves as grave robbing and oppose all forms 
                    of bioanthropological analysis. Others see the value of some 
                    studies, particularly the non-destructive ones, when graves 
                    lay unalterably in the path of &quot;progress.&quot; Still 
                    others do not object to destructive testing when it is being 
                    done for a solid scientific purpose that promises to shed 
                    light on Caddo history. See &quot;<a href="graves.html" class="text">Graves 
                    of Caddo Ancestors</a>&quot; for more discussion of this controversial 
                    topic. </p>
                  <p><span class="text"><strong>Archeologists</strong> study early Caddo 
                    history by documenting, mapping, and excavating Caddo sites 
                    and examining &quot;material culture,&quot; meaning the tangible 
                    physical remains such as pottery, stone tools, animal bones, 
                    and so on found at the sites. Since archeologists have been 
                    investigating sites in the Caddo Homeland for almost a century, 
                    a thorough review of the history of investigation would be 
                    lengthy. Here we will outline only the major developments.</span></p>
                  <p class="text">The first systematic archeological exploration 
                    of the region began around 1908 through the efforts of <strong>Clarence 
                    B. Moore</strong> of the Philadelphia Academy of Science. Moore's 
                    elaborately illustrated reports of his work at sites along 
                    the Red and Ouachita rivers are valuable sources of information. 
                    In fact, his observations are all that will ever be known 
                    of several mound sites that were subsequently destroyed by 
                    the meandering Red River. Moore's work in the Caddo area was 
                    followed by the 1917-1920 explorations in the southern Ouachita 
                    Mountains by <strong>Mark R. Harrington</strong> on behalf of the Heye 
                    Foundation of New York.</p>
                  <p class="text">By 1920s, it was thought that the mound sites 
                    along the Red River in Arkansas and Texas were probably associated 
                    with the Cadohadacho and that sites in the Neches-Angelina 
                    drainages in east Texas were linked to the Hasinai. In 1930, 
                    with modest funding from the Smithsonian Institution, the 
                    University of Texas began undertaking major excavations at 
                    a number of Caddo sites in east Texas under the supervision 
                    of <strong>James Pearce</strong> and his field director, <strong>A. T. Jackson</strong>. 
                    After the mid-1930s, funding and manpower from the WPA (Works 
                    Progress Administration) allowed the University of Texas to 
                    expand its work in east Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">Like Moore, the University of Texas archeologists 
                    chose prominent mound sites like the Hatchel Mound near Texarkana 
                    (see <a href="../../nasoni/index.html" class="text">Upper 
                    Nasoni</a> exhibit) and the Sanders site north of Paris, Texas, 
                    and locales where prehistoric cemeteries were known to exist. 
                    Graves were sought out because they often contained whole 
                    pots and other interesting objects. Similar excavations were 
                    undertaken at Caddo sites in Oklahoma and Arkansas in the 
                    1930s under the WPA. Such projects resulted in a great many 
                    whole and fragmentary pottery vessels and many other artifacts, 
                    but little real appreciation of Caddo history and few substantive 
                    publications. This was to change in the 1940s as the result 
                    of the efforts of the first real scholar to take an interest 
                    in Caddo archeology, <strong>Alex D. Krieger</strong>.</p>
                  <p class="text">Krieger was placed in charge of the WPA lab 
                    at the University of Texas in Austin in the late 1930s and 
                    soon began systematic comparisons among collections from different 
                    sites in the Caddo area. During World War II, he wrote the 
                    first synthesis of Caddo history based on his comparative 
                    studies as part of his larger 1946 study <em>Culture Complexes 
                    and Chronology in Northern Texas</em>. He continued this work 
                    during his analysis of the artifacts from the George C. Davis 
                    site. The Davis site near Nacogdoches, Texas, had been excavated 
                    in 1939-1941 by the WPA under the direction of a skilled and 
                    meticulous field archeologist, <strong>Perry Newell</strong>. Newell 
                    died just after World War II, leaving Krieger to finish their 
                    now-famous 1949 report, <em>The George C. Davis Site, Cherokee 
                    County, Texas</em>.</p>
                  <p class="text">In these two studies, Krieger synthesized the 
                    culture history of the &quot;Caddoan&quot; area, including 
                    Spiro and the Arkansas Basin. He defined Early Caddoan (Gibson 
                    aspect) and Late Caddoan (Fulton aspect) periods as well as 
                    thirteen geographical clusters (foci) across the Caddoan area 
                    that he thought represented closely related sites. Krieger 
                    put quote marks around the term &quot;Caddoan&quot; because 
                    he realized the area had a more diversity than implied by 
                    the label. While many of Krieger's concepts were later refined 
                    or discarded, his work brought national recognition of the 
                    Caddo area and of its relationship to parallel developments 
                    in the lower Mississippi Valley and elsewhere in the Eastern 
                    Woodlands. </p>
                  <p class="text">One of Krieger's most important collaborators 
                    was <strong>Clarence H. Webb</strong>, a pediatrician from Shreveport, 
                    Louisiana, who became a very influential Caddo archeologist. 
                    Webb began investigating Caddo sites along the Red River in 
                    northwestern Louisiana in 1935 and kept at it for the next 
                    45 years. While Webb had no formal training in archeology, 
                    his medical education, familiarity with the area, and aptitude 
                    more than made up for it. Webb's energy, enthusiasm, and long-term 
                    persistence were unmatched. Working on weekends and vacations, 
                    Webb and his friends conducted excavations at numerous major 
                    Caddo sites including Mounds Plantation, Gahagan, and Belcher. 
                    He reported the results in conference presentations, journal 
                    articles and monographs, including one entitled <em>The Belcher 
                    Mound: A Stratified Caddoan Site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana</em> 
                    that was published in 1959 as a Memoir of the Society for 
                    American Archaeology. Through such efforts he succeeded in 
                    demonstrating the antiquity of Caddo and pre-Caddo settlement 
                    in the region. He also pioneered the use of the direct historical 
                    method in the Caddo area, tracing Caddo patterns back in time 
                    from historical records into prehistory.</p>
                  <p class="text">Webb was instrumental in starting a very useful 
                    scholarly tradition, the <strong>Caddoan (or Caddo) Conference</strong>. 
                    The first conferences in the late 1930s were informal gatherings 
                    at Webb's house attended by only the handful of researchers 
                    who knew or cared about Caddo archeology (Krieger and Newell 
                    were among them). As time went on the Caddo Conference became 
                    a more regular, and then annual, event attended by dozens 
                    and sometimes hundreds of researchers, students, and enthusiasts. 
                    These conferences were and are essential devices for breaking 
                    down the state-line barriers and uniting archeologists in 
                    Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. By the 1970s Caddo 
                    tribal members began participating in the conference, resulting 
                    in improved communication between the archeologists and the 
                    Indians whose ancestors they studied.</p>
                  <p class="text">In recent decades there have been dozens of 
                    major investigations at Caddo sites and hundreds of smaller 
                    ones. In 1960s and 1970s reservoir salvage archeology provided 
                    the impetus and opportunity to undertake research at a number 
                    of important locales within the Caddo Homeland in Oklahoma, 
                    Texas, and Arkansas. Since the late 1970s, federal and state 
                    cultural resource laws have led to much more archeological 
                    work in the region. In fact, <strong>contract or CRM (cultural 
                    resource management) archeology accounts for most of the research 
                    done at Caddo sites over the last 25 years</strong>. Although many 
                    CRM projects are small and the results usually reported in 
                    technical reports of limited distribution, excellent research 
                    has been accomplished on smaller sites that probably would 
                    not have attracted other researchers. CRM projects have also 
                    provided the first systematic surveys in the Caddo Homeland, 
                    recording many small habitation sites in places archeologists 
                    had previously ignored.</p>
                  <p class="text">Despite the increase in CRM-related investigation, 
                    the Caddo Homeland has seen less concentrated research than 
                    many other areas of the Eastern Woodlands. One of the main 
                    reasons for this inequity is that major public and private 
                    universities in all four states are situated outside the Caddo 
                    area. As a direct consequence, the region long lacked resident 
                    professional archeologists. Fortunately, two changes have 
                    occurred. One has been the hiring of archeologists as teachers 
                    at several smaller universities in the area. In Texas, <strong>James 
                    Corbin</strong> at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches 
                    has been active in Caddo archeology as has <strong>Hiram Gregory</strong> 
                    at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. 
                    The other welcome change has been the establishment of regional 
                    &quot;station&quot; archeologists in Arkansas and Louisiana 
                    in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. This has meant that 
                    professional archeologists are living and working in the Caddo 
                    Homeland year round. Archeologists <strong>Ann Early</strong> (now Arkansas 
                    State Archeologist), <strong>George Sabo</strong>, and<strong> Frank Schambach</strong> 
                    in Arkansas, as well as <strong>Jeff Girard</strong> and <strong>George Avery 
                    </strong>in Louisiana have made major contributions. Typically, 
                    the station archeologists also teach at small universities 
                    and colleges in the region.</p>
                  <p class="text">In Texas and Arkansas and, to a lesser extent, 
                    Oklahoma and Louisiana, state and regional archeological societies 
                    and associations have held field schools and conducted research 
                    at numerous Caddo sites. Such organizations are made up of 
                    avocational (amateur) and professional archeologists. In Arkansas 
                    and Louisiana, avocational archeologists usually work with 
                    the regional and station archeologists. In Texas and Oklahoma, 
                    avocational archeologists sometimes work with the state historic 
                    preservation offices and sometimes work on their own. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today archeologists are asking new questions 
                    and applying new technology to learn more about Caddo ancestors. 
                    <strong>Darrell Creel</strong>, director of TARL, and <strong>Samuel Wilson</strong>, 
                    professor of anthropology at UT Austin, are currently directing 
                    new investigations at the George C. Davis site. Their goal 
                    is to create a detailed map of the Early Caddo settlement 
                    using state-of-the-art geophysical survey equipment. This 
                    equipment allows archeologists to detect subtle magnetic variations 
                    created 700-1200 years ago by Caddo builders. The result, 
                    as can be seen to the left, are nothing short of amazing. 
                    The use of such non-destructive techniques holds great promise 
                    for the future of Caddo archeology. </p>
