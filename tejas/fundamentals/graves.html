                    dating to before 1000 years ago (A.D. 1000) based on one documented 
                    by archeologists beneath Mound C at the George C. Davis site 
                    in 1969. Eight individuals were laid to rest in this tomb 
                    and were accompanied by various grave offerings including 
                    a ceremonial flint &quot;sword&quot; blade that symbolized 
                    authority. One interpretation is that the individual buried 
                    with the blade was an important leader. The other seven people 
                    may have been retainers, slaves, or family members sacrificed 
                    to honor the departed leader. Similar tombs are known from 
                    many ancient Caddo sites, especially those dating to the early 
                    Caddo era (about A.D. 800-1200). Courtesy artist Nola Davis

                  <p class="text">Caddo ancestors were laid to rest within the 
                    Caddo Homeland for generation upon generation. Following the 
                    accepted burial custom of the day, grieving relatives laid 
                    each departed Caddo in his or her grave with solemn rituals 
                    that, in historic times, traditionally lasted six days,during the journey of the deceased to the House of the Dead in the Sky. Often 
                    the custom included burying the dead with special artifacts 
                    or offerings, especially beautifully decorated pottery vessels, 
                    but also with shell ornaments and other items symbolizing 
                    their role in society and other things as well. Since Late 
                    Woodland times, over 1200 years ago, Caddo people were buried 
                    soon after death in a manner that archeologists describe as 
                    primary interments. Typically, the deceased were laid out 
                    on their backs in a fully extended position, a single individual 
                    in each grave. In contrast, in many areas of the Eastern United 
                    States (including the Arkansas Basin) the deceased were placed 
                    in charnel houses where priests defleshed<span class="text"> 
                    the bones and stored them for months or even years. In such 
                    societies, the stored remains were periodically gathered and 
                    buried in ossuaries, large communal graves, as secondary interments, 
                    as part of communal rituals. Craig Mound at Spiro is an extraordinary 
                    example of a complex mortuary facility. </span></p>
                  <p class="text"><span class="text">In prehistoric and early 
                    historic times, the offerings and burial rituals for important 
                    Caddo leaders were very elaborate, representing major expenditures 
                    of effort and wealth apparently thought to befit the leader's 
                    exalted position in society. Sometimes leaders were buried 
                    in deep tombs dug through mounds and into the original earth, 
                    perhaps symbolically connecting sacred times past with the 
                    departed. At other times leaders were buried among their people, 
                    but even then their graves were set apart by size, location, 
                    and offerings. Ordinary Caddos had less elaborate graves and 
                    were often buried in family cemeteries and sometimes (especially 
                    children) buried beneath the floors of their houses. These 
                    differences are just a few of those that could be mentioned; 
                    Caddo burial practices were somewhat different from group 
                    to group and they changed over time.</span></p>
                  <p class="text"><span class="text">We know this because grave 
                    robbers, farmers, archeologists, and construction bulldozers 
                    have been digging up Caddo graves for over a century, a fact 
                    that causes great pain to many Caddo people today. If 
                    it were the graves of your ancestors that were subject to this distruction, you would understand 
                    how the Caddo feel: violated, disrespected, and very sad. 
                    There is no easy way to explain what has happened or why and 
                    no way to reconcile all the conflicting views on the subject 
                    of Caddo graves.</span></p>
                  <p class="text"><span class="text">Since the early 1900s archeologists 
                    have sought out and excavated Caddo graves, most of which 
                    faced imminent destruction by looters, farming, and natural 
                    erosion. The graves, skeletal remains, and associated offerings 
                    have provided critical knowledge about the Caddo past. For 
                    example, information on social organization, health, and disease 
                    based on Caddo graves is not otherwise obtainable from archeological 
                    evidence. The way a society treats its dead says much about 
                    that society, and clearly there is no other comparable source 
                    of information for prehistoric societies. In addition, physical 
                    remains are practically the only source of information on 
                    individual lives of ancestral Caddo people, as well as on the 
                    biological relationships among individuals and populations.</span></p>
                  
					<p class="text">Unfortunately, for many decades archeologists 
                    treated Caddo graves with little awareness of the feelings 
                    of living Caddo peoples. Taking a Western scientific perspective, 
                    archeologists regarded human remains and grave offerings as 
                    mere evidence, perhaps important evidence, but evidence nonetheless. 
                    In this view, the remains are considered dispassionately and 
                    treated like any other fragile and potentially important kind 
                    of artifact. With that attitude, most archeologists had no 
                    interaction with the Caddo Nation because they really did not appreciate 
                    the connection between the ancient Caddo and the living 
                    Caddo.</p>
					
                  <p class="text">Part of the problem was that, by the 20th century, 
                    very few Caddo people lived in the Caddo Homeland where archeologists 
                    were working. Unfortunately, the thought that Caddo people 
                    living in west-central Oklahoma might still care about the 
                    graves of their distant ancestors was just not there. To be 
                    fair, to most archeologists the concept of &quot;ancestors,&quot; 
                    as seen through western eyes, refers mainly to relatives a 
                    family still retains memory or record of. They did not realize that in Native American eyes, ancestors of the recent 
                    past are thought of in much the same way as ancestors of the 
                    ancient past. This attitude was not unique to the archeologists 
                    who worked in the Caddo area&#151;it was widely shared by 
                    most American archeologists. American archeologists came to 
                    believe that many aspects of prehistoric North American were 
                    essentially unconnected to modern tribes&#151;too much time 
                    and too many changes had occurred; cultural continuity had 
                    been lost. </p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists saw themselves as the only ones 
                    truly interested in the prehistory of North America and thought 
                    that archeology was the only thing standing between ignorance 
                    of the past and willful grave destruction. As enlightened 
                    scientists, archeologists sincerely believed they were working 
                    against the inevitable march of progress and against the &quot;dark 
                    side&quot;&#151;grave robbers and land development.</p>
                  <p class="text"> In truth, most people who dig up Caddo graves 
                    are not archeologists; they are artifact collectors intent 
                    on finding valuable things, most of all, whole pottery vessels and other funerary offerings. They 
                    are usually called pothunters, looters, or grave robbers. 
                    Some do have an interest in documenting what they find and 
                    consider themselves &quot;amateur archeologists,&quot; but 
                    most dig up graves solely to find grave offerings. Most dig 
                    without regard to whatever human remains they find and keep 
                    little or no record. As a group, grave robbers are highly 
                    secretive and rarely publish descriptions of their work and 
                    findings. Some want the artifacts just for their own personal 
                    collections, but increasingly the motive is greed. An intact, 
                    finely engraved Caddo pottery vessel can bring thousands of dollars on 
                    the antiquities market. Untold hundreds of Caddo graves have been dug up every year in this manner, at least an order of magnitude 
                    more than the number of graves that archeologists excavate.</p>
					
                  <p class="text">Today, archeologists rarely excavate Caddo graves 
                    except in circumstances required by federal and state cultural 
                    resource laws and/or occasioned by emergency salvage. When 
                    archeologists encounter Caddo graves during the course of 
                    cultural resource management projects, they routinely consult 
                    with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. In contrast, grave robbing 
                    continues apace and slows only because so many cemeteries 
                    have already been destroyed. Still, many Caddo graves 
                    are dug up each year by those hunting Caddo pots. Grave robbers 
                    often trespass on private, state, or federal lands and dig 
                    up graves surreptitiously and illegally.</p>
                  <p class="text">Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas all have laws affording some legal protection to &quot;unmarked graves.&quot; In Texas, these legal protections fall under the recently amended Health and Safety Code of Texas and the Texas Administrative Code. Today, most professional archeologists in Texas do hold the view that human graves, marked or unmarked, Indian or Anglo-American, historic or prehistoric, Christian or non-Christian, should be protected by law and left unmolested except when unavoidable or with particularly good cause, such as a significant research question that can only be answered by studying graves. In such cases archeologists should work with descendant communities to reach an equitable compromise between scientific and humanistic concerns. Such a compromise is not always possible.</p>
                  <p class="text">While all Caddo people may not have the same 
                    attitude toward the graves of their ancestors, most believe 
                    the resting places of their ancestors are sacred and should be left undisturbed 
                    out of respect for their memory. One of the most remarkable 
                    things about ancestral Caddo cemeteries is that one grave rarely 
                    intrudes into another, even in cases where the burials were 
                    separated in time by decades or even centuries. Given the 
                    complete absence of headstones or other durable markers, the 
                    graves must have been marked by perishable materials, likely marker poles, that 
                    were periodically renewed. This shows that Caddo cemeteries, 
                    like most cemeteries in the United States today, were created 
                    as permanent resting places that were cared for by succeeding 
                    generations. Given this tradition, it is easy to understand 
                    why some Caddo see grave robbing as grave robbing whether 
                    it be done in the name of science, curiosity, or commerce. 
                    Other Caddo see a difference and acknowledge that archeologists 
                    have learned many things about Caddo ancestors that had been 
                    lost. Much of the content of the Tejas exhibit you are reading 
                    comes from archeological research.</p>
                  <p class="text">For their part, most archeologists today realize 
                    that science is only one perspective and that Caddo peoples 
                    have every right to play a major role in deciding what should 
                    happen to Caddo skeletal remains, graves, and grave offerings. 
                    Most of the change in attitude came about after the passage 
                    of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
                    Act (NAGPRA). This federal law enacted in 1990 is really a 
                    civil rights law that has had profound consequences for the 
                    Caddo and other federally recognized Indian tribes. Essentially 
                    NAGPRA says that human graves on federal and tribal lands 
                    are to be protected. It also says that Native American descendants 
                    should decide the fate of the skeletal remains, grave offerings, 
                    and sacred objects of their ancestors that are encountered 
                    by the federal government and held by any institution, such 
                    as a museum, that receives federal funding. NAGPRA requires 
                    federal agencies that administer or carry out archeological 
                    research on federal or tribal lands to consult with the appropriate 
                    tribes in advance of work that might disturb graves associated 
                    with their ancestors. </p>
                  <p class="text">The result has been that, for the first time, 
                    the Caddo tribe has been given a say-so in what happens when 
                    Caddo graves are encountered that fall under NAGPRA regulations. 
                    The Caddo tribe also has the right to decide what happens 
                    to the Caddo skeletal remains and grave offerings in museums 
                    and repositories across the country. As a consequence, constructive 
                    dialogues have taken place in recent years between the tribe and all of the major 
                    agencies and organizations that are involved in archeology 
                    in the Caddo Homeland. </p>
                  <p class="text">NAGPRA attempts to balance the legitimate interests 
                    of Native Americans and scientists. While the intent of the 
                    law is clear and reasonable, the enabling regulations have 
                    created a tedious and contentious process that sometimes pits 
                    Native Americans against archeologists, oral tradition against 
                    science, and one tribe against another. For instance, who 
                    should decide the fate of the many skeletal remains and grave 
                    offerings that cannot be definitively affiliated to a living tribe? 
                    What happens when two tribes both claim the same grave? How 
                    about when a scientist proposes to use destructive analytical 
                    methods in order to determine which, if any, living tribe 
                    can be linked to those skeletal remains? </p>
                  <p class="text">Fortunately, things have gone relatively smoothly in the Caddo Homeland in comparison to many other places in the country. For one thing the Caddo Homeland and the archeological sites within it is well known and there are few disputes about whether a grave is associated with the tribe or not. Still, there are many issues that remain to be resolved. For instance, the Caddo Nation has not made a final decision regarding what to do with all the Caddo skeletal remains and grave offerings in museums and repositories, although they have established a reburial cemetery on their tribal land. Some say &quot;rebury them all,&quot; but how and where? Who will pay for proper burials for so many things? Others recognize that the thousands of Caddo pottery vessels sitting on shelves represent a tremendous cultural legacy. In many cases the skeletal remains the pottery vessels once accompanied have not survived (mainly due to acidic soil conditions). Should all these objects be buried again and, in essence, removed from visible Caddo history? Some say that Caddo pottery vessels and other grave offerings should be returned to the tribe and sensitively displayed in a museum run by the Caddo. But building and running a museum takes lots of money and training. The tribe has taken positive steps in this direction with the creation of the Caddo Heritage Museum and its own Tribal Historic Preservation Office. In the end, under NAGPRA, the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma makes the final decisions on the repatriation and reburial of human remains and funerary offerings affiliated to them.</p>
