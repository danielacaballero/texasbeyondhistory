                    dating to before 1000 years ago (A.D. 1000) based on one documented 
                    by archeologists beneath Mound C at the George C. Davis site 
                    in 1969. Six individuals were laid to rest in this tomb and 
                    were accompanied by various grave offerings including a ceremonial 
                    flint &quot;sword&quot; blade that symbolized authority. One 
                    interpretation is that the individual buried with the blade 
                    was an important leader. The other five people may have been 
                    retainers or family members sacrificed to honor the departed 
                    leader. Similar tombs are known from many ancient Caddo sites, 
                    especially those dating to the early Caddo era (about A.D. 
                    800-1200). Courtesy artist Nola Davis and the Texas Parks

                  <br><p class="text">Caddo ancestors were laid to rest within the 
                    Caddo Homeland for generation upon generation. Following the 
                    accepted burial custom of the day, grieving relatives laid 
                    each departed Caddo in his or her grave with solemn ritual. 
                    Often the custom included burying the dead with special artifacts 
                    or offerings, especially decorated pottery vessels, but also 
                    shell beads and other items symbolizing their role in society 
                    and other things as well. Since Late Woodland times, over 
                    1200 years ago, Caddo people were buried soon after death 
                    in what archeologists call primary interments. Typically, 
                    the deceased were laid out on their back in a fully extended 
                    position, a single individual in each grave. In contrast, 
                    in many areas of the Eastern United States (including the 
                    Arkansas Basin) the deceased were placed in charnel houses 
                    where priests defleshed the bones and stored them for months 
                    or even years. In such societies, the stored bones were periodically 
                    gathered and buried in ossuaries, large communal graves, as 
                    secondary interments, as part of communal rituals. Craig Mound 
                    at Spiro is an extraordinary example of such an ossuary. </p>
                  <p class="text">In prehistoric and early historic times, the 
                    offerings and burial rituals for important Caddo leaders were 
                    very elaborate, representing major expenditures of effort 
                    and wealth apparently thought to befit the leader's exalted 
                    position in society. Sometimes leaders were buried in deep 
                    tombs dug through mounds and into the original earth, perhaps 
                    symbolically connecting sacred times past with the departed. 
                    At other times leaders were buried among their people, but 
                    even then their graves were set apart by size, location, and 
                    offerings. Ordinary Caddos had less elaborate graves and were 
                    often buried in family cemeteries and sometimes (especially 
                    children) buried beneath the floors of their houses. These 
                    differences are just a few of those that could be mentioned; 
                    Caddo burial practices were somewhat different from group 
                    to group and they changed over time.</p>
                  <p class="text">We know this because archeologists, grave robbers, 
                    farmers, and construction bulldozers have been digging up 
                    Caddo graves for over a century, a fact that causes great 
                    pain to many Caddo people today. And if it were the graves 
                    of your ancestors, you might understand how the Caddo feel: 
                    violated, disrespected, and very sad. There is no easy way 
                    to explain what has happened or why and no way to reconcile 
                    all the conflicting views on the subject of Caddo graves.</p>
                  <p class="text">Since the early 1900s archeologists have sought 
                    out and excavated Caddo graves out of the belief that the 
                    graves, the bones, and, especially, the offerings or &quot;grave 
                    goods&quot; would reveal something worth knowing about the 
                    Caddo past. And much of interest and importance has been learned 
                    from Caddo graves. For instance, very little would be known 
                    about the Caddo's extraordinary tradition of fine pottery 
                    were it not for the thousands of whole pots that have been 
                    found in Caddo graves. But for many decades archeologists 
                    treated Caddo graves with little awareness of the feelings 
                    of living Caddo peoples. Taking a Western scientific perspective, 
                    archeologists regarded bones and grave goods as mere evidence, 
                    perhaps important evidence, but evidence nonetheless. In this 
                    view, the bones and artifacts are considered dispassionately 
                    and handled like any other fragile and potentially important 
                    kind of artifact. With that attitude, most archeologists saw 
                    no reason to interact with the Caddo tribe because they really 
                    did not see much connection between the ancient Caddo and the 
                    living Caddo.</p>
                  <p class="text">Part of the problem was that, by the 20th century, 
                    very few Caddo people lived in the Caddo Homeland, where archeologists 
                    were working. But the fact that the Caddo had been given land 
                    not far away in west-central Oklahoma was known to archeologists. 
                    Unfortunately, the thought that Caddo people might still care 
                    about the graves of their ancestors was just not there. To 
                    be fair, to most archeologists the concept of &quot;ancestors,&quot; 
                    as seen through western eyes, refers mainly to relatives a 
                    family still retains memory or record of. They did not appreciate 
                    the fact that in Native American eyes, ancestors of the recent 
                    past are thought of in much the same way as ancestors of ancient 
                    past. This attitude was not unique to the archeologists who 
                    worked in the Caddo area&#151;it was widely shared by most 
                    American archeologists. American archeologists came to believe 
                    that many aspects of prehistoric North American were essentially 
                    unconnected to modern tribes&#151;too much time and too many 
                    changes had occurred; cultural continuity had been lost. </p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists saw themselves as the only ones 
                    truly interested in the prehistory of North America and thought 
                    that archeology was the only thing standing between ignorance 
                    of the past and willful grave destruction. As enlightened 
                    scientists, archeologists sincerely believed they were working 
                    against the inevitable march of progress and against the &quot;dark 
                    side&quot;&#151;grave robbers and land development. In truth, 
                    most people who dig up Caddo graves are not archeologists; 
                    they are artifact collectors intent on finding valuable things, 
                    most of all, whole pots. They are usually called pothunters, 
                    looters, or grave robbers. Some do have an interest in documenting 
                    what they find and consider themselves &quot;amateur archeologists,&quot; 
                    but most dig up graves solely to find grave goods. Most dig 
                    without regard to whatever bones they find and keep little 
                    or no record. As a group, grave robbers are highly secretive 
                    and rarely publish descriptions of their work and findings. 
                    Some want the artifacts just for their own personal collections, 
                    but increasingly the motive is greed. An intact, finely engraved 
                    Caddo pot can bring thousands of dollars on the antiquities 
                    market. Untold hundreds of Caddo graves are dug up every year 
                    in this manner, at least an order of magnitude more than the 
                    number of graves that archeologists excavate.</p>
                  <p class="text">Robbing Indian graves is perfectly legal on 
                    private land in Texas with permission of the landowner, but 
                    Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana all have laws affording 
                    some legal protection to &quot;unmarked graves.&quot; Attempts 
                    to pass a similar law for Texas have failed repeatedly over 
                    the last two decades. Today the strongest opponents to such 
                    a law are property rights activists who do not believe the 
                    state should have any say so on what they do on their land. 
                    This attitude is regretful and misplaced. The view taken here 
                    is that human graves, marked or unmarked, Indian or Anglo, 
                    historic or prehistoric, Christian or non-Christian, should 
                    be protected by law and left unmolested except when unavoidable 
                    or with particularly good cause, such as a significant research 
                    question that can only be answered by studying graves. In 
                    such cases archeologists should work with descendant communities 
                    to reach an equitable compromise between scientific and humanistic 
                    concerns. Such a compromise is not always possible.</p>
                  <p class="text">While all Caddo people may not have the same 
                    attitude toward the graves of their ancestors, most that we 
                    know do. They believe the resting places of their ancestors 
                    should be left undisturbed out of respect for their memory. 
                    One of the most remarkable things about ancient Caddo cemeteries 
                    is that one grave rarely intrudes into another, even in cases 
                    where the burials were separated in time by decades or even 
                    centuries. Given the complete absence of headstones or other 
                    durable markers, the graves must have been marked by perishable 
                    materials that were periodically renewed. This shows that 
                    Caddo cemeteries, like most cemeteries in the United States 
                    today, were created as permanent resting places that were 
                    cared for by succeeding generations. Given this tradition, 
                    it is easy to understand why some Caddo see grave robbing 
                    as grave robbing whether it be done in the name of science, 
                    curiosity, or commerce. Other Caddo see a difference and acknowledge 
                    that archeologists have learned many things about Caddo ancestors 
                    that had been lost. Much of the content of the Tejas exhibit 
                    you are reading comes from archeological research.</p>
                  <p class="text">For their part, most archeologists have realized, 
                    if belatedly, that science is only one perspective and that 
                    Caddo peoples have every right to play a major role in deciding 
                    what should happen to Caddo bones, graves, and grave goods. 
                    Most of the change in attitude came about after the passage 
                    of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation 
                    Act (NAGPRA). This federal law enacted in 1990 is really a 
                    civil rights law that has had profound consequences for the 
                    Caddo and most other federally recognized Indian tribes. Essentially 
                    NAGPRA says that human graves on federal and tribal lands 
                    are to be protected. It also says that Native American descendants 
                    should decide the fate of the bones, grave goods, and sacred 
                    objects of their ancestors that are encountered by the federal 
                    government and any institution holding such remains (like 
                    a museum) that receives federal funding. NAGPRA requires federal 
                    agencies that administer or carry out archeological research 
                    on federal or tribal lands to consult with the appropriate 
                    tribes in advance of work that might disturb graves associated 
                    with their ancestors. </p>
                  <p class="text">The result has been that, for the first time, 
                    the Caddo tribe has been given a say-so in what happens when 
                    Caddo graves are encountered that fall under NAGPRA regulations. 
                    The Caddo tribe also has the right to decide what happens 
                    to the Caddo bones and grave goods in museums and repositories 
                    across the country. As a consequence, constructive dialogues 
                    have begun between the tribe and all of the major agencies 
                    and organizations that are involved in archeology in the Caddo 
                    Homeland. </p>
                  <p class="text">NAGPRA attempts to balance the legitimate interests 
                    of Native Americans and scientists. While the intent of the 
                    law is clear and reasonable, the enabling regulations have 
                    created a tedious and contentious process that sometimes pits 
                    Native Americans against archeologists, oral tradition against 
                    science, and one tribe against another. For instance, who 
                    should decide the fate of the many bones and grave goods that 
                    cannot be linked definitively to a living tribe? What happens 
                    when two tribes both claim the same grave? How about when 
                    a scientist wants to use destructive analytical methods in 
                    order to determine which, if any, living tribe can be linked 
                    to those bones? </p>
                  <p class="text">Fortunately, things have gone relatively smoothly 
                    in the Caddo Homeland in comparison to many other places in 
                    the country. For one thing the Caddo Homeland is well known 
                    and there are few disputes about whether a grave is associated 
                    with the tribe or not. Still, there are many issues that remain 
                    to be resolved. For instance, the Caddo Nation has not made 
                    a final decision regarding what to do with all the Caddo bones 
                    and grave goods in museums and repositories. Some say &quot;rebury 
                    them all,&quot; but how and where? Who will pay for proper 
                    burials for so many things? Others recognize that the thousands 
                    of Caddo pots sitting on shelves represent a tremendous cultural 
                    legacy. In many cases the bones the pots once accompanied 
                    have not survived (mainly due to acidic soil conditions). 
                    Should all these objects be buried again and, in essence, 
                    removed from visible Caddo history? Some say that Caddo pots 
                    and other grave goods should be returned to the tribe and 
                    sensitively displayed in a museum run by the Caddo. But building 
                    and running a museum takes lots of money and training. The 
                    tribe is taking positive steps in this direction with the 
                    creation of the Caddo Heritage Museum and its own Tribal Historic 
                    Presevation Office.</p>
                  <h3>Website Policy on Images of Bones and Graves</h3>
                  <p class="text">For almost a century archeological reports on 
                    excavations at Caddo sites have routinely included photographs 
                    and drawings of graves, human skeletons, and grave goods. 
                    This is part of standard scientific documentation, not an 
                    attempt to sensationalize the findings or focus on the macabre. 
                    Some Caddo people find such depictions offensive, particularly 
                    photographs of the bones of their ancestors. In consideration 
                    of their feelings, it is the policy of <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net" class="text">www.TexasBeyondHistory.net</a> 
                    not to display photographs of human remains except in special 
                    circumstances where such photographs are deemed essential. 
                    In lieu of photographs, we will use drawings of graves or 
                    bones where appropriate. Photographs of grave offerings and 
                    of grave scenes in which bones are absent are used. In all 
                    cases, the focus is on what has been learned from studying 
                    Caddo graves and on illustrating the artistry and meaning 
                    embodied in grave goods.</p>
                  <p class="text">An example of the &quot;special circumstances&quot; 
                    under which photographs of human remains might be shown is 
                    a deposit of human mandibles (jaws) and skulls at the Crenshaw 
                    site in southwestern Arkansas near the Red River. At that 
                    site, probable early Caddo ancestors some 1000 years ago buried 
                    deposits of human jaws and skulls thought to represent &quot;trophies,&quot; 
                    perhaps from their enemies. This behavior is highly unusual 
                    and it is clear that the deposits of skulls and jaws are not 
                    human burials in the ordinary sense. It is instead the result 
                    of extraordinary ritual behavior, whose full meanings are 
                    not understood. Because of the unusual and obviously very 
                    significant circumstance, several photographs are shown. In 
                    order, however, to be sensitive to those who do not wish to 
                    see any photographs of human remains, an additional step is 
                    added. The thumbnail images shown with the text are distorted 
                    and clearly marked &quot;Image of Human Remains&quot; so that 
                    those who do not want to see the photographs will not have 
                    to. Viewers who do wish to see the photograph can examine 
                    the actual image by clicking on the thumbnail. An example 
                    is shown at the left.</p>
