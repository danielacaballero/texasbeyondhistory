                  <p class="text">Over 150 generations of Caddo people have lived 
                    and died since the time more than 3,000 years ago (perhaps 
                    much more) when the ancestors of the Caddo split from the 
                    ancestors of the Northern Caddoan groups (see <a href="languages.html" class="text">Caddoan 
                    Languages and Peoples</a> section). Over this long span of 
                    human history, Caddo societies have changed in all kinds of 
                    ways, some of them fundamental. Today we have only an inkling 
                    of most of these changes. </p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists find evidence of only certain 
                    kinds of specific events, such as the debris lfet behind from a multi-year settlement, the burning of a house or 
                    the burial of an individual, that leave obvious traces. Most 
                    ordinary events and even those that must have been extraordinary 
                    like victory celebrations, visits by the leaders of distant 
                    groups, and the destruction of a village by a tornado, leave 
                    few traces that an archeologist can recognize. Similarly, 
                    most individuals are invisible in the archeological record. 
                    The only individuals who stand apart in prehistory are those 
                    whose burials we find. Archeologists can recognize patterns 
                    and detect trends through time, but without written or remembered 
                    history to guide us, our view of prehistory is very broad&#151;sort 
                    of like flipping through a history book and seeing only the 
                    chapter titles and a few pictures.</p>
                  <p class="text">To cope with uncertainty and information gaps, 
                    archeologists construct chronologies (timelines) such as the 
                    one presented below. While such a linear concept of time is 
                    useful to scientists and historians, it would have been foreign 
                    to the ancient Caddo. In most traditional Native American 
                    societies, time was perceived as cyclical and reoccurring. 
                    It was measured and marked by moons, seasons, generations, 
                    and transforming events such as massive floods, celebrated 
                    victories, the founding of a new village, or the death of 
                    a charismatic leader. </p>
                  <p class="text">However, knowledge of most of the transforming 
                    events in Caddo history has been lost, leaving us with a mix 
                    of faint surviving memories, dance and song tradition, a precious 
                    few detailed early written accounts, and an ever-growing mass 
                    of archeological data from hundreds of archeological sites 
                    linked to the Caddo. This latter may sound impressive, but 
                    most such archeological sites are places where fragments of 
                    Caddo-style pottery have been found on the surface and little 
                    investigation has been carried out. Even with the relatively 
                    few sites that have seen extensive archeological research, 
                    it is often difficult to determine precisely when the sites 
                    were occupied without considerable research effort. Dating is almost always an exercise in approximation 
                    in archeology. Even the radiocarbon dating technique yields 
                    only statistical estimates with decades-long standard error 
                    ranges, rather than precise dates.</p>
                  <p class="text">Our knowledge of the later history of the Caddo, 
                    after Europeans arrived and began recording information, is 
                    much fuller, but still very incomplete. Europeans only wrote 
                    about what they happened to see or learn that interested or 
                    concerned them. And they always saw the Caddo through the 
                    eyes of strangers in a strange land. As we move toward the 
                    present, our view of history becomes sharper and sharper as 
                    we listen to Caddo voices and compare what they say to what 
                    various officials, travelers, and neighbors wrote. Maps, paintings, 
                    photographs, and voice recordings all add critical knowledge.</p>
                  <p class="text">With these caveats in mind, we present a culture 
                    history timeline that summarizes some of the major changes 
                    through time. In this chart you will notice that the earlier 
                    periods are longer and are often rounded off into centuries 
                    or even thousands of years. This reflects the lack of precision 
                    of our dating methods. Note also that some of the periods 
                    shown below overlap with one another. This is because time 
                    periods are abstract approximations that cut up time into 
                    neat little blocks out of convenience; in reality things do not 
                    always occur in an orderly linear succession or occur simultaneously 
                    from place to place. Even today in the Digital era, there 
                    are still millions of people across the world that do not 
                    have electricity or running water, technological advances 
                    that most of us take for granted. This example reminds us 
                    that technological and cultural changes typically take decades 
                    or centuries to spread, even today.</p>

                                who moved from place to place hunting and trapping 
                                wild animals and gathering the seeds, nuts, fruits, 
                                and roots of wild plants. Archaic hunters used 
                                the atlatl (spear-thrower) and dart to kill their 
                                favorite prey, white-tailed deer. By 2,000 B.C., 
                                people living not far to the north and east (in 
                                Missouri, Illinois, and Kentucky) began experimenting 
                                with gardening. By selecting the best stock, they 
                                gradually developed the first domesticated forms 
                                of oily and starchy seeded plants such as squash, 
                                goosefoot, and sunflower. Some of the Late Archaic 
                                groups in the Caddo Homeland may have begun small-scale 
                                gardening as well. Part-time gardeners or not, 
                                Late Archaic peoples seem to have increased their 
                                numbers and put down roots. The intensive harvesting 
                                of hardwood nuts, such as hickory and walnut, 
                                combined with deer hunting and a host of other 
                                food resources, apparently provided enough surplus

                                from being mobile hunter-gatherers to increasingly 
                                settled villagers who planted domesticated crops 
                                to supplement wild foods, a change with profound 
                                consequences. With agriculture and settled life 
                                came the ability to produce and store surplus 
                                food, higher population levels, and the need for 
                                new ways of organizing, integrating, and protecting 
                                society. The finding of artifacts in graves made 
                                of exotic materials from sources hundreds of miles 
                                away, shows that Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove 
                                peoples living in the Caddo Homeland were linked 
                                to other peoples across much of the Eastern Woodlands. 
                                In this sort of long-distance trade (down-the-line 
                                exchange) the exotic goods were probably given 
                                leader to leader to further ritual and social 
                                ties, not economic ties. The Woodland period also 
                                saw the introduction of pottery making from the 
                                Southeast, as well as, around A.D. 500, a new 
                                weapon system, the bow and arrow (probably from

                              <p>Around 1200 years ago, early Caddo society began 
                                to crystallize as one of the earliest Mississippian 
                                cultures in the Southeast. Among the many villages, 
                                some emerged as ritual centers, special places 
                                where religious and political leaders lived. Early 
                                ritual centers were places where temples and other 
                                special buildings stood, sometimes on top of earthen 
                                mounds. Temple and burial mounds were sometimes 
                                arranged around open plazas, where the peoples 
                                gathered on solemn and festive occasions. During 
                                this time, complex religious and social ideas 
                                took hold, including the notion that some people 
                                and certain lineages (kin groups) were more important 
                                than others. Evidence of these changes are seen 
                                most clearly in large tombs thought to contain 
                                adult male leaders accompanied by retainers or 
                                family members sacrificed in their honor and fancy 
                                grave offerings including obvious symbols of authority

                              <p>By 1000 years ago, Caddo society can be said 
                                to have entered its heyday, an era of unprecedented 
                                wealth, population, and prestige that lasted over 
                                600 years and was still underway in A.D. 1542 
                                when Caddo peoples were first encountered by Europeans. 
                                The Caddo were the westernmost people of the Mississippian 
                                world, an ethnically and politically fragmented 
                                realm that stretched eastward to Georgia and northern 
                                Florida and as far north as Illinois and Wisconsin. 
                                Major Caddo ritual centers in most parts of the 
                                Caddo Homeland, especially along the Red River, 
                                were the principal places of small, independent 
                                societies. The Caddo had developed a distinct 
                                pottery tradition and produced extremely fine 
                                pottery, no doubt the envy of neighbors far and 
                                wide. Overall, the Early Caddo period seems to 
                                have been a time of cultural unity during which 
                                Caddo groups in many areas did many things the 
                                same way such as pottery making and burying their

                                Caddo settlements built throughout the Caddo Homeland 
                                including many places that had not been settled 
                                before. Ritual mound centers seem to have become 
                                less important in some areas. By Late Caddo times,

                                distinct local traditions, pronounced variations 
                                on the theme of being Caddo. The increasing reliance 
                                on corn agriculture and high population levels 
                                resulted in declining health among Caddo people.

                              <p>The first Europeans to set foot in the Caddo 
                                Homeland were Spaniards who were members of the 
                                De Soto entrada in 1542. They did not stay long 
                                and well over a century would pass before Europeans 
                                returned to the Caddo world. In the intervening 
                                period, the seeds of profound change began to 
                                reach the Caddo: Old World diseases, plants (such 
                                as peaches and watermelons), animals (especially 
                                horses), and metal tools and weapons. In the late 
                                1600s, the Spanish entered the region from the 
                                southwest and the French from the Mississippi 
                                Valley. They established missions and trading 
                                posts and competed with one another for control 
                                over the Caddo domain. Recurring diseases (like 
                                smallpox) continued to decimate Caddo populations. 
                                Rival Indian groups, now equipped with guns, encroached 
                                from the east. Yet this is the very period during 
                                which the Caddo entered written history and the 
                                period upon which much of our understanding about 
                                Caddo life is based. Early chroniclers encountered 
                                at least two dozen named, independent Caddo groups, 
                                some speaking separate dialects of a common language.</p>                            </td>
