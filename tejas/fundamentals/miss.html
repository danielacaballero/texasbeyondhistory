                  <p class="text">Between about A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1600 much of 
                    the Eastern Woodlands was part of a highly dynamic world of 
                    competing chiefdoms or ranked societies that represent the 
                    climax in cultural complexity for Native American societies 
                    north of Mexico. These developments are generally known as 
                    the <strong>Mississippian tradition</strong> in recognition of the role 
                    that the fertile floodplains of the mighty river and its major 
                    tributaries played in supporting the biggest and most powerful 
                    prehistoric and historic chiefdoms. Mississippian societies 
                    were based on agriculture, especially corn (maize) agriculture. 
                    The Mississippian world was never uniform or united; instead 
                    it was fragmented and fractious, a 600-year era during which 
                    dozens of chiefdoms arose and then fell apart, none lasting 
                    longer than a few hundred years, and few controlling large 
                    territories.</p>
                  <p class="text">What exactly is meant by <strong>chiefdom</strong>? Anthropologists 
                    use this term to describe a pre-state, kinship-based society 
                    that typically has at least a thousand people and at least 
                    two social classes led by a hereditary leader, often called 
                    a chief or cacique by Europeans. Among the Natchez Indians 
                    in the lower Mississippi Valley, these two &quot;ranked&quot; 
                    social classes were known as &quot;Suns&quot; and &quot;Stinkards.&quot; 
                    The paramount chief, called the &quot;Great Sun,&quot; was 
                    the Natchez leader because he was a Sun by birth and because 
                    he and his closest Sun kin had the personal abilities to maintain 
                    control and authority over the Natchez. There were also various 
                    lesser chiefs who answered to the Great Sun and made sure 
                    that he received tribute in the form of food or special things 
                    regularly from all of the Natchez, most of whom lived in outlying 
                    hamlets organized into districts. The Great Sun lived in a 
                    fortified village with large earthen mounds atop which were 
                    temples and the houses of the chief and his favored priests 
                    and attendants. We know all this from the eyewitness account 
                    of a French explorer, Le Page du Pratz, who lived among the 
                    Natchez in 1720, shortly before the Natchez chiefdom collapsed 
                    due to the ravages of European diseases and rapidly changing 
                    social circumstance. </p>
                  <p class="text">Many broadly similar societies were encountered 
                    around the world by European explorers, some having relatively 
                    &quot;simple&quot; forms of social organization and some having 
                    &quot;complex,&quot; highly structured societies like the 
                    Natchez. Chiefdoms are inherently unstable because the authority 
                    of the leaders and legitimacy of the ranking social class 
                    depends mightily on the cooperation of the people. Chiefs 
                    achieve this cooperation by using sacred rituals and ancestor 
                    worship to reaffirm the legitimacy of their own lineage. In 
                    such societies, politics and religion are tightly interwoven. 
                    Chiefs also hold sway by arranging elaborate ceremonies and 
                    feasts during which accumulated wealth is redistributed as 
                    gifts, thus building bonds of social obligation. The famous 
                    potlatches among the Indians of the Pacific Northwest coast 
                    are perhaps the best-known examples of this behavior. Chiefdoms 
                    frequently fall apart because of infighting among kin groups, 
                    failure to effectively deal with crisis (such as drought or 
                    warfare), and a host of other reasons. </p>
                  <p class="text">As you might imagine, archeological evidence 
                    rarely tells us exactly what transpired in the ancient chiefdoms 
                    we recognize among Mississippian societies, including those 
                    of the Caddo. Archeologists often prefer the term <strong>ranked 
                    society</strong> instead of chiefdom, because it is easier to recognize 
                    the existence of different social classes (or at least differential 
                    treatment of the dead) than it is to identify the nature of 
                    leadership organization. The nature of (and even existence 
                    of) redistribution systems is also very difficult to &quot;see&quot; 
                    archeologically. </p>
                  <p class="text"> In the Caddo Homeland, the most convincing 
                    evidence of ranked societies is a settlement hierarchy within 
                    which are a few large ritual (mound) centers and many small 
                    villages, smaller hamlets, and individual farmsteads. The 
                    larger centers contain evidence of special structures such 
                    as temples, council houses, and a few over-sized houses (&quot;elite 
                    residences&quot;), some of which were built atop mounds. The 
                    larger mounds and larger structures (many of which were not 
                    built on mounds) are sometimes arranged around a open plaza. 
                    Nonetheless, buildings and mounds at Caddo centers were more 
                    irregularly arranged than neatly laid out, in contrast to 
                    some of the larger Mississippian centers and towns elsewhere.</p>
                  <p class="text">In Caddo ritual centers, as elsewhere in the 
                    Mississippian world, we also find elaborate burials containing 
                    exotic artifacts and other indications that a few people were 
                    treated much better than most. Typically, most ritual centers 
                    seem to have grown to maximum size and complexity and then 
                    declined or entirely abandoned within a few hundred years. 
                    Across the Mississippian world, the timing of the peaks in 
                    the fortunes of individual mound centers varies widely within 
                    the 600-year span.</p>

                          waned in the late 13th century, important sacred objects 
                          like this pipe were taken to other sites like Spiro 
                          and Gahagan.<br>

                  <p class="text">Among the hundreds of ritual centers across 
                    the Mississippian world, most were relatively small and contained 
                    only a few mounds. A few among them stood out as <strong>primate 
                    centers</strong>. These places were the biggest of the big, the 
                    political and ritual centers of complex and unusually successful 
                    chiefdoms. The largest and most powerful of them all was the 
                    Cahokia site in the central Mississippi Valley near present 
                    day St. Louis. Cahokia had perhaps 200 earthen mounds and 
                    may have been home to as many as 15,000 people at its height 
                    around A.D. 1150. To the southeast were Moundville, in northern 
                    Alabama, and Etowah, in northern Georgia, both the largest 
                    sites in their local regions and both peaking 100-150 years 
                    after Cahokia. In the lower Mississippi Valley, the sites 
                    of Winterville and Lake George had dozens of mounds and were 
                    larger than all others in the region. The westernmost major 
                    center was the site of Spiro in the Arkansas Valley. </p>
                  <p class="text">The best candidate for a primate center in the 
                    main Caddo Homeland is the Battle site in southwest Arkansas 
                    in the Great Bend area of the Red. This site contains the 
                    largest mound in the Caddo Homeland and one of the largest 
                    in the Southeast, measuring some 670 feet in length, 320 feet 
                    wide, and 34 feet high. The only other known mounds at the 
                    Battle site were four very low rises (now leveled for agriculture), 
                    but there are numerous cemeteries, occupation areas, and mounds 
                    in the general vicinity that may well have been part of the 
                    greater Battle community. Unfortunately, the site has only 
                    seen minor investigation and remains little known. The absence 
                    of obvious primate centers in the main Caddo Homeland may 
                    reflect, at least in part, the nature of Caddo settlement 
                    patterns: people lived in dispersed communities more often 
                    than nucleated villages. There are numerous smaller ritual 
                    centers in the Caddo Homeland that probably served as the 
                    central places of small, independent polities (political units) 
                    that some would call chiefdoms.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although never politically united, the Mississippian 
                    world was united in a cultural sense by participation in widespread 
                    religious and social phenomena often described as &quot;cults.&quot; 
                    This is perhaps a poor choice of terms as the word cult may 
                    conjure up images of small extremist groups. Mississippian 
                    &quot;cults&quot; were part of very powerful and widespread 
                    religious movements that we are only beginning to understand.</p>
                  <p class="text">The best-known Mississippian religious movement 
                    is popularly known as the <strong>Southern Cult</strong>, although most 
                    archeologists today prefer the less evocative phrase <strong>Southeastern 
                    Ceremonial Complex</strong>. The central tenets of this cult or 
                    religion were transmitted through rituals and through the 
                    exchange of sacred objects emblazoned with symbols such as 
                    falcons, crosses, and rattlesnakes. Often the iconography 
                    depicts scenes of violence and warfare, such as warrior figures 
                    holding weapons and decapitated heads. These symbols were 
                    carved, modeled, engraved, and painted on many materials, 
                    most of them probably perishable (like cloth and wood) or 
                    made from exotic materials, such as copper and marine shell, 
                    imported from distant sources.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Southern Cult was exclusive&#151;only certain 
                    individuals and kin groups participated, thus supporting the 
                    authority of the chiefs. They alone could handle, wear, and 
                    own the most sacred symbols, which were no doubt perceived 
                    as possessing power and being too dangerous for any but the 
                    chosen few to handle. When the leaders died, the cult artifacts 
                    were buried with them, perhaps to protect the people from 
                    danger. (Or, to take a more pragmatic interpretation, to keep 
                    such symbols out of general circulation, and thus rare and 
                    more prestigious.) By exchanging these symbolic artifacts 
                    among one another, the leaders also maintained trading and 
                    political alliances. Such alliances were important because 
                    warfare appears to have been widespread. </p>
                  <p class="text">Among the Southern Cult artifacts that do survive, 
                    carved marine shell gorgets (chest ornaments) and drinking 
                    cups, are the most widely distributed. Many shell ritual objects 
                    were made from lightning whelk shells from the northern Gulf 
                    coast. The cups were used in rituals during which participants 
                    consumed the famous &quot;black drink,&quot; a dark tea made 
                    from yaupon leaves. Much misinformation exists about the black 
                    drink. Its principal active ingredient is caffeine. Early 
                    European visitors to the Southeast were appalled when they 
                    witnessed what could be called &quot;projectile vomiting&quot; 
                    during rituals involving the consumption of the black drink. 
                    This purposeful ritual purging or cleansing was induced by 
                    drinking lots of hot tea quickly, not by the properties of 
                    the tea. Yaupon bears the scientific name <em>Ilex vomitoria</em>, 
                    a name born out of European misunderstanding.</p>
                  <p class="text">There is also good evidence for the existence 
                    of a widespread <strong>Earth Cult</strong> (for lack of a better term) 
                    that was tied to renewal, fertility, and the periodic building 
                    of earthen mounds. This set of beliefs was communal in nature 
                    and served to bring people together to participate in community-wide 
                    rituals. Periodically, temples and other special buildings 
                    were carefully dismantled or burned and buried with a fresh 
                    layer of earth, often chosen for its color and texture. Burial 
                    mounds received similar treatment: periodic renewal by the 
                    addition of new layers of earth. </p>
                  <p class="text">Some archeologists, including Dee Ann Story 
                    and Frank Schambach, think that for the Caddo what was most 
                    important was not the mounding of earth, per se, but what 
                    the earth was mounded over&#151;ritually destroyed temples 
                    and tombs. Referring to the burning of temples, Schambach 
                    believes that &quot;for the Caddo, one immediate objective 
                    of this ritual may have been to produce the great plume of 
                    smoke and steam that must have emanated from each burned and 
                    buried building for days or even weeks, as a cord or more 
                    of wood was slowly reduced to charcoal.&quot; He reasons that, 
                    to the Caddo, <strong>fire</strong> and <strong>smoke</strong> were the key elements, 
                    not earth, an idea that finds support in early historic accounts 
                    of the importance of fire to Caddo groups.</p>
                  <p class="text">Earth, fire, or smoke, the timing of such ritual 
                    activities was probably tied to the agricultural cycle and 
                    perhaps to longer ritual cycles linked to the death of important 
                    chiefs or astronomical phenomena. Major ritual events almost 
                    certainly included feasting, dancing, and other communal activities.</p>
                  <p class="text">The third widely shared religious practice was 
                    <strong>Ancestor Veneration</strong>. Showing respect for exalted ancestors 
                    took many forms, including elaborate burials such as the shaft 
                    tombs of the Caddo and mounds where only certain members of 
                    society were buried. Most Caddo groups were unusual among 
                    Mississippian societies in that they buried their dead quickly 
                    while their bodies were still intact. Most other societies 
                    in the Eastern Woodlands had charnel houses where bodies were 
                    stored until the flesh had rotted (or had been removed by 
                    priests) and only bones were left. Periodically, the charnel 
                    houses were cleaned out and the accumulated bones buried together 
                    during elaborate rituals, perhaps also linked to renewal. 
                    Another widespread indication of ancestor worship is the existence 
                    of temples containing human statues made of stone or wood 
                    and some times sacred bundles or boxes containing the bones 
                    of a revered ancestor or special ritual items. These are best 
                    known from the accounts of early European explorers, although 
                    human statues made out of wood, ceramics, and stone have been 
                    found at Spiro and other Mississippian sites. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mississippian iconography often seems to glorify 
                    war and victory over vanquished foe. But as far as we can 
                    tell, most Mississippian warfare was more akin to raiding 
                    or ritual warfare, rather than all-out conquest. Most conflicts 
                    were probably raids to kill or capture warriors for revenge 
                    or arranged battles of limited scope. Nonetheless, the presence 
                    of fortified towns, particularly in the Mississippi Valley, 
                    suggests that people had reason to fear. Warrior motifs are 
                    often found on the engraved shells and other symbolic artifacts. 
                    Armed figures holding human head and scenes of decapitation 
                    and human sacrifice leave little doubt that military victories 
                    were glorified. Unambiguous archeological evidence of ritual 
                    cannibalism support eyewitness accounts of early explorers. 
                    Mississippian life was sometimes violent and gruesome. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddo Homeland was on the geographical and 
                    cultural edge of the Mississippian world. As far as we can 
                    tell, ancestral Caddo groups never established large, complex 
                    chiefdoms, with the possible exception of Spiro. Instead the 
                    Caddo world was one of relatively small-scale chiefdoms of 
                    the sort described by the Spanish and French chroniclers. 
                    The largest Caddo centers had less than a dozen mounds, usually 
                    far less. With the notable exception of Battle Mound, most 
                    Caddo earthworks are small by comparison to those at major 
                    Mississippian centers, and tiny by comparison to Cahokia. 
                    Caddo centers were also laid out less formally and more organically 
                    than major Mississippian centers and they lacked fortifications.</p>
                  <p class="text">What accounts for these differences? The location 
                    of the Caddo Homeland on the western frontier of the Eastern 
                    Woodlands is clearly a major factor. Most of the river valleys 
                    of the Caddo Homeland pale in size and productivity in comparison 
                    to the Mississippi and its major tributaries where many of 
                    the Mississippian developments took place. It is no accident 
                    that the largest and most complex Mississippian society developed 
                    at Cahokia in the central Mississippi valley. In the same 
                    way, Spiro is in the Arkansas Valley and, to the south, most 
                    of the larger Caddo centers occur along in the Great Bend 
                    region of the Red River, the largest and most fertile of the 
                    waterways in the main Caddo Homeland. Another consequence 
                    of being on the Mississippian frontier is that Caddo groups 
                    did not have any neighboring competing chiefdoms to contend 
                    with (at least to the west), which probably helps explain 
                    why Caddo sites were not fortified. </p>
                  <p class="text">The other major factor seems to have been the 
                    nature of Caddo societies themselves. Caddo societies seem 
                    to have split apart before becoming too large. We can speculate 
                    that Caddo societies developed mechanisms for sharing food 
                    and wealth and for &quot;social leveling&quot; &#151; keeping 
                    high and low ranking classes (or clans) from being too segregated. 
                    Rigid caste-like social classes like those of the Natchez 
                    do not appear to have existed among the historic Caddo. Still, 
                    Caddo societies were not egalitarian; they had marked social 
                    inequalities as described in early historic accounts, and 
                    seen in differences in house size and location within archeological 
                    sites, in differences in comparative size and wealth among 
                    sites, and in differences in grave elaboration. </p>

                          sheet copper. The pair probably represent ritual ear 
                          ornaments as depicted on the effigy pipe from Spiro 
                          shown opposite.<br>

                          Long-nosed god depictions are known from many North 
                          American and Mesoamerican cultures. Anthropologist Robert 
                          Hall has linked the Mississippian-period long-nosed 
                          god with the mythical figure known as Red Horn or He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings 
                          to the historic Winnebago and Iowa Indians of the upper 
                          Midwest. Hall believes the mask earrings were part of 
                          adoption rituals in Mississippian society during which 
                          important leaders extended fictive kinship bonds to 
                          visiting leaders, thus cementing political alliances.
