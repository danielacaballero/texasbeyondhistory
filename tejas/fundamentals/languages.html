                  <h3>&quot;Caddo&quot; vs. &quot;Caddoan&quot;</h3>
                  <p class="text">The words &quot;Caddo&quot; and &quot;Caddoan&quot; 
                    have been used to mean different things by different researchers 
                    and writers, adding considerable confusion to the complex 
                    and often impossible task of understanding the relationships 
                    among historic tribes and their ancestors. In the Tejas exhibits 
                    we have tried to use these terms consistently. </p>
                  <p class="text">In historical documents the word <strong>Caddo</strong> 
                    is sometimes used to refer just to the Cadohadacho, but today 
                    it is more commonly applied to all of the Caddo-speaking groups. 
                    Although there was not a united Caddo Tribe until 1874 when, 
                    under pressure from the U.S. government, the remnants of the 
                    groups speaking various dialects of the Caddo language formally 
                    joined together for survival, the term Caddo is still very 
                    useful to refer to (1) the united Caddo Tribe; (2) all of 
                    the groups known to have spoken Caddo dialects before 1859; 
                    (3) the Caddo language; and (4) the direct ancestors of the 
                    Caddo-speaking groups as inferred from archeological evidence. 
                    Further the word is used both as a singular (i.e., the Caddo 
                    village) and plural noun (i.e., the Caddo were corn farmers), 
                    although the plural form, Caddos, is also used.</p>
                  <p><span class="text">Fine so far: <strong>Caddo means anything to 
                    do with the Caddo Tribe and its direct ancestors.</strong> <strong>It 
                    is the term &quot;Caddoan&quot; that causes trouble.</strong> In 
                    normal English language usage, the word can correctly be used 
                    as the adjectival form of Caddo (i.e., the Caddoan village). 
                    But it took on another meaning in 1891 when ethnologist and 
                    famed explorer John Wesley Powell formally defined the Caddoan 
                    language family. Powell, like other scholars before him, recognized 
                    that the Caddo language was closely related to the Wichita, 
                    Pawnee, Arikara, and Kitsai languages and, rightly, lumped 
                    them together in one language family. </span></p>
					
                  <p class="text">Since the 1940s, archeologists have used the 
                    term <strong>Caddoan Area </strong>to refer to the southern and easternmost 
                    region containing prehistoric and historic sites linked to 
                    the ancestors of the Caddoan language family groups, although this term has fallen out of common usage. The Caddoan Area was mainly the home of the Caddo-speaking groups; however, its northern part may have been occupied in prehistoric times by some of the ancestors of certain other Caddoan groups, notably the Wichita and Kitsai. This is uncertain because the ancestors of all Caddoan language groups appear to have migrated over hundreds of miles during their histories. (Except the ancestors of the Caddo language speakers, who seem to have stayed more or less in one general area throughout their known history.) In 1542 when the De Soto entrada traveled through parts of the area, all of the Caddo groups who were encountered apparently spoke a Caddo dialect.  Unfortunately, the Caddoan 
                    Area as traditionally defined includes both the main area 
                    that we will call the &quot;Caddo Homeland&quot; as well as 
                    what is often called the &quot;Northern Caddoan Area.&quot; 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>main Caddo Homeland</strong> lies south of 
                    the Arkansas River in the valleys and tributaries of the Ouachita, 
                    Red, Sabine, and Neches rivers where the historically documented 
                    Caddo speakers lived until the 19th century. This area, sometimes 
                    referred to as the &quot;Southern Caddo Area,&quot; has 
                    abundant and unmistakable archeological evidence that the 
                    direct ancestors of Caddo-speaking peoples lived there since at least A.D. 800 and probably for 3000-4000 years or longer, 
                    perhaps much longer. In other words, within the main Caddo 
                    Homeland, the cultural continuity is unbroken from prehistory 
                    to early history and the link to today's Caddo Nation of Oklahoma 
                    is unquestioned. </p>
                  <p class="text">In contrast, the cultural continuity of the 
                    <strong>Arkansas Basin</strong> (the so-called &quot;Northern Caddoan 
                    Area&quot;), the valleys of the Arkansas River and its tributaries 
                    and adjacent southern Ozark Highlands in northeastern Oklahoma 
                    northwestern Arkansas, and even southwest Missouri, was broken prior to  the arrival of the earliest European visitors. 
                    This circumstance is discussed elsewhere (see &quot;<a href="spiro.html" class="text">Spiro 
                    and the Arkansas Basin</a>&quot;). Briefly, it is not known 
                    whether the area was occupied by the ancestors of Caddo-speaking 
                    peoples, the ancestors of the Kitsai, or the ancestors of the 
                    Wichita. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddoan archeological tradition clearly 
                    represents the ancestors of the Caddo, but it may also, in 
                    part, include archeological sites occupied by the ancestors 
                    of the Wichita and Kitsai. In fact, as explained below, thousands 
                    of years ago in Woodland and Archaic times it is likely that 
                    the ancestors of all the Caddoan language family lived in 
                    or near the Caddoan Area.</p>
                  <p class="text">To avoid the confusion between the Caddoan language 
                    family and the word Caddoan as the adjectival form of Caddo, 
                    <strong>throughout the Tejas exhibits we use the term &quot;Caddo&quot; 
                    to refer only to the Caddo speakers, their language, and their 
                    direct ancestors as identified archeologically. We use the 
                    term &quot;Caddoan&quot; only in the linguistic sense to refer 
                    to the Caddoan language family.</strong></p>
                  <h3>Brief History of the Caddoan Language Family </h3>
                  <p class="text">Before modern transportation and communication 
                    systems existed, languages spread and changed in similar, 
                    fairly predictable ways. When a people speaking a common language 
                    split apart, with one group migrating elsewhere and becoming 
                    geographically isolated from the other, the &quot;mother&quot; 
                    language as spoken by each group gradually changed over time. 
                    For instance, new words may be coined, old words may be dropped, 
                    and pronunciation changes. (Witness the differences in the 
                    English spoken by Britains, Americans, and Australians.) The 
                    mother language becomes two dialects that, over time, become 
                    more and more different until eventually the speakers of one 
                    dialect cannot understand the other. This is how new languages 
                    form. </p>
                  <p class="text">Linguists are the specialists who study languages 
                    and how they relate to one another. They have worked out the 
                    basic relationships among most of the world's surviving languages 
                    and have classified them into various families and branches. 
                    Linguists often use a branching tree as a metaphor for how 
                    languages are related. English, German, Dutch, and Yiddish, 
                    for instance, are all Germanic languages that represent the 
                    West Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. 
                    Similarly, the Romance languages that developed out of Latin, 
                    such as Spanish, French, and Italian, form the Italic branch 
                    of the Indo-European language family. </p>
                  <p class="text">By systematically studying how different and 
                    similar two related languages are, linguists can estimate 
                    how long ago they split apart, a technique called <strong>glottochronology</strong>. 
                    Glottochronology is controversial because, among other reasons, 
                    not all languages change at the same rate and because it is 
                    often difficult or impossible to compare languages that are 
                    poorly known. A great many languages have become extinct in 
                    the last few centuries including over half the languages spoken 
                    by Native American peoples 500 years ago. Still, studying 
                    the relationships among languages is a powerful way of reconstructing 
                    the early histories of different peoples across the world. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Unfortunately, the last published glottochronology 
                    for all the Caddoan languages dates to the 1960s, before the 
                    technique was refined. According to this estimate, the Caddoan 
                    languages did not begin splitting apart until 3,000 to 3,500 
                    years ago. Some Caddo archeological experts such as Timothy 
                    K. Perttula reject this estimate and suggest that the initial 
                    split between Southern and Northern Caddoan languages (see 
                    below) may have taken place thousands of years earlier. That 
                    said, as one goes back in time, confidently linking language 
                    and ethnicity with archeological evidence is increasingly 
                    difficult, if not impossible. </p>
                  <p class="text">Nonetheless, the linguistic estimate is that 
                    prior to about 3,500 years ago, the distant ancestors of all 
                    of the Caddoan groups were a single people who spoke an ancestral 
                    language that linguists call <strong>Proto-Caddoan</strong>. Of course, 
                    Proto-Caddoan has long been extinct or, rather, it evolved 
                    into the various Caddoan languages as the Proto-Caddoan ancestors 
                    split apart and went their separate ways. It is estimated 
                    that about 3,500 years ago (1500 B.C.) the ancestors of the 
                    Northern Caddoan groups split from the Caddo and the two languages 
                    began to change. Sometime after the time of Christ, the Proto-Northern-Caddoan 
                    speakers began splitting off from one another, first the Wichita, 
                    then the Kitsai, and finally the Pawnee. Still later, only 
                    400-500 years ago, the Arikara split from the Pawnee. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddoan languages are distantly related 
                    to the Iroquoian languages (such as Iroquois and Cherokee) 
                    and even more distantly related to the Siouan languages (such 
                    as Dakota and Crow). Because of certain similarities, linguists 
                    theorize that these three language families have had a common 
                    origin (a shared ancestry) at some remote point in time, probably 
                    in the central part of the country, perhaps somewhere along 
                    the central valley of the Mississippi River. But this was 
                    so long ago (perhaps more than 10,000 years?) that any historical 
                    reconstruction is little more than a guess. Within the Caddoan 
                    language family, however, we can reconstruct at least the 
                    general patterns of movement over time.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>All of the groups that spoke a Caddoan language 
                    lived west of the Mississippi River, along its western tributaries. 
                    </strong>During historic times the Caddoan groups were spread across 
                    an area that spanned about 1200 miles north-south and almost 
                    500 miles east-west. At historic contact, the latest groups 
                    that had split off among the Northern Caddoans lived the farthest 
                    north. The Arikara lived in what is now South and North Dakota, 
                    while the Pawnee lived in present day Nebraska. The Northern 
                    Caddoan groups that had split off earlier, the Witchita and 
                    Kitsai, lived between the Pawnee and the Caddo, in what is 
                    today Kansas and Oklahoma. Based on such geographical clues, 
                    linguists surmise that the original homeland of the Proto-Caddoan 
                    speakers was in the forested western fringe of the Eastern 
                    Woodlands, within or very near what has been recognized as the Caddo Homeland.</p>
                  <p class="text">To replay the outlines of Caddoan history, we 
                    can guess that Proto-Caddoan ancestors lived in the Caddo 
                    Homeland, perhaps in or near the valleys of the Red and Arkansas 
                    rivers and the intervening Ouachita Mountatins. One group 
                    stayed on and became the Caddo and another split off and began 
                    moving north and west, probably up the Red and Arkansas river 
                    systems. The Proto-Northern Caddoan speakers gradually moved 
                    farther out onto the Plains and split apart as they moved 
                    west and north. The ancestors of the Pawnee and Arikara moved 
                    farther and farther north and west up the Missouri River and 
                    its tributaries, eventually losing all memory of the Caddo. 
                    The ancestors of the Wichita and Kichai stayed in the Southern 
                    Plains. Nonetheless, the Caddo were separated from all of 
                    the Northern Caddoan groups long enough ago that they had 
                    no tradition of a common ancestry, nor could they speak to 
                    one another. </p>
                  <p class="text">By the end of the Plains Woodland era (about 
                    A.D. 900), if not before, the ancestors of most (all?) of 
                    the Northern Caddoan peoples were <strong>Plains villagers</strong>, 
                    farmers and buffalo hunters who lived in villages scattered 
                    through the wooded valleys across the Plains. Some archeologists 
                    think that Caddoan-speaking groups spread westward across 
                    Oklahoma, north Texas including the Panhandle, and Kansas, 
                    as far as the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in 
                    what is today northeastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado. 
                    After A.D. 1350 in the 14th and 15th centuries, the &quot;southwestern&quot; 
                    Plains villagers abandoned that area and moved north and east, 
                    apparently in response to climatic changes and the encroachment 
                    from the west and northwest of Apachean peoples. The ethnic 
                    affiliations of the southwestern Plains villagers are not 
                    known, but some archeologists believe they may have included 
                    the ancestors of the Pawnee/Arikara and the Wichita. </p>
					
                  <p class="text">In contrast with the Caddo, who stayed put in 
                    their original homeland, <strong>all of the Northern Caddoan groups 
                    appear to have migrated hundreds of miles during the last 
                    two millennia</strong>. Their inferred early history makes ecological 
                    sense. The relatively dry climate of the southern and central 
                    Great Plains is prone to periodic drought and thus is often marginal 
                    for dry land farming. (The western Caddoan Homeland is also 
                    drought prone, but to a lesser extent.) And without modern 
                    machinery and irrigation, the great grasslands of the Plains 
                    could not be farmed. Hence the Plains villagers lived along 
                    the relatively narrow and well-watered river valleys where 
                    farming was possible. The bands of each group had to spread 
                    out along the narrow valleys and were susceptible to raids 
                    from enemy groups. Raiding and climatic change are two of 
                    the main factors that explain why the Plains Caddoans moved 
                    from place to place. The complex histories and migrations 
                    of the Wichita, Kitsai, Pawnee, and Arikara peoples reflect 
                    their precarious existence on the Plains. </p>
                  <h3>Northern Caddoan Peoples</h3>
                  <p class="text">Sadly little can be said about the poorly known 
                    <strong>Kitsai tribe</strong> (also spelled Kichai). The Kitsai language 
                    is no longer spoken and only a bit of it was recorded before 
                    the last Kitsai speaker passed away in the 1930s. The tribe 
                    no longer exists as a separate entity; surviving members joined 
                    the Wichita in the mid-1800s. The Kitsai appear to have been 
                    farmers and hunters, like all Caddoan peoples, and are mentioned 
                    in various French and Spanish documents. Throughout their 
                    known history during the 18th and early 19th centuries, the 
                    Kitsai were relatively few in number and divided into two 
                    groups, a northern band allied with the Wichita, and a southern 
                    band allied with the Cadohadacho and other Caddo groups. Their 
                    known territory was in south-central Oklahoma and north-central 
                    Texas, just west of the Caddo, especially along the Red River. 
                    Several archeological sites in north Texas have been linked, 
                    speculatively, to the Kitsai, including the mid-18th century 
                    <a href="../../gilbert/index.html" class="text">Gilbert site</a>, 
                    although the evidence is not compelling. Some archeologists 
                    believe that Kitsai ancestors were the prehistoric people 
                    of Spiro and the Arkansas Basin.</p>
                  <p class="text">The<strong> Wichita</strong> are much better known than 
                    the Kitsai, because they were a more numerous people, and 
                    because they survived as a tribe. Like the Caddo, the Wichita 
                    were made up of a number of related, but independent groups 
                    including the Tawakoni, Yscani, Hueco, and Wichita proper, 
                    that probably each spoke a separate dialect. The Wichita groups 
                    (along with the remaining Kitsai) became a single tribe in 
                    1835 when they signed a treaty with the United States. Ancestral 
                    Wichita groups were first encountered in 1541 by Coronado's 
                    expedition in the vicinity of the Great Bend of the Arkansas 
                    River in present day south-central Kansas. The Spanish named 
                    the area Gran Quivira and reported visiting a series of large 
                    villages, some containing 200 large dome-shaped grass houses 
                    similar to those built by the Caddo. During the historic era, 
                    the Wichita groups moved southward through Oklahoma and into 
                    Texas as far south as Waco, which was named after the Wichita 
                    Hueco band whose village once stood where the city was built. 
                    Like the Caddo, the Wichita were resettled in Indian Territory 
                    after the Civil War and today maintain a tribal center near 
                    Anadarko, Oklahoma.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>Pawnee</strong> and <strong>Arikara</strong> had a shared 
                    history (i.e., were one people) until splitting apart perhaps 
                    400-500 years ago, just before historic contact. Their ancestors 
                    have been identified archeologically as the Upper Republican 
                    phase of the Central Plains Village tradition in Kansas and 
                    Nebraska. After they split apart, the Arikara moved farther 
                    north into what is today South Dakota. Both groups lived in 
                    earthen lodges in compact villages that were sometimes fortified. 
                    Like other Caddoans, both groups had a mixed economy with 
                    farming and buffalo hunting being important. The Pawnee relied 
                    heavily on bison, while the Arikara were also fishermen as 
                    well as traders. Prior to consolidation during the 19th century, 
                    both the Arikara and Pawnee were made up of independent bands 
                    speaking their own dialects. Today the Arikara remain in North 
                    Dakota, where they settled on a reservation with the Sioux-speaking 
                    Mandan and Hidatsa. The Pawnee have a tribal center in north-central 
                    Oklahoma, where they were given land in 1876 in exchange for 
                    giving up much of Nebraska.</p>

                          among the various Caddoan languages and indicates the 
                          order in which the various language groups are thought 
                          to have split from one another. How long ago the various 
                          splits occurred is very poorly known. Linguistic estimates 
                          suggest that, prior to about 3,500 years ago, the ancestors 
                          of all of the groups were a single people who spoke 
                          an ancestral language that linguists call Proto-Caddoan. 
                          About 3,500 years ago (1500 B.C.) the ancestors of the 
                          Northern Caddoan groups split from the Caddo and the 
                          two languages began to diversify. (Some archeologists 
                          think the initial split may have occurred thousands 
                          of years earlier.) Sometime after the time of Christ, 
                          the Proto-Northern-Caddoan speakers began splitting 
                          off, first the Wichita, then the Kitsai, and finally 
                          the Pawnee. Still later (not long before Europeans arrived) 
                          the Arikara split from the Pawnee and Pawnee split into 
                          two groups.</div>
