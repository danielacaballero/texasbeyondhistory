            <p class="text">It began one warm day in the second week of June, 
              1991, when members of the Caddo Culture Club walked into the Museum 
              of the Red River in Idabelle, Oklahoma. The club had formed several 
              years earlier under the leadership of Lowell &quot;Wimpy&quot; Edmonds 
              to bring together tribal members interested in preserving traditional 
              knowledge, the Caddo language, and traditional forms of expression 
              such as dance. They were visiting the area at the invitation of 
              the Texas Archeological Society during the Society's annual field 
              school, held that year at the Roitsch site, an ancient Caddo settlement 
              on the Texas side of the river. The archeological group had asked 
              the Caddos to come see what they were doing and perform traditional 
              Caddo dances. This, in itself, was a first and an important step 
              toward a closer and more respectful relationship between Texas archeologists 
              and the Caddo Nation. But for the present story the real eye-opener 
              came when the Caddos visited the museum.</p>
            <p class="text">Entering the museum, the tribal members were stunned 
              to see hundreds of often spectacular pottery vessels made by their 
              ancestors on display and in storage. Vessel after vessel, bowls, 
              bottles, jars, fancy fine wares, and everyday cooking pots. Tribal 
              elder Randlett Edmonds, who was in his 70s, turned to his friends 
              and said &quot;I haven't seen this before, I did not know,&quot; 
              recalls Jereldine Redcorn. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="text"><em>&quot;We all felt that way and there were Caddo 
                women with us who were in their 80s. Way in the back of our minds 
                some of us must have had an idea, but most of us really did not 
                understand what we had lost until that moment. That day we were 
                so excited that we decided as a group, as a tribe, we would learn 
                how to do it and make Caddo pottery once again.&quot;</em></p>
            </blockquote>
			  <p class="text">Reviving the lost tradition of making Caddo pottery 
              proved anything but easy. Of those who vowed to learn that day, 
              only one was young enough and determined enough to be able to make 
              it happen. Somehow the ancient pots in that museum spoke to Jereldine 
              Redcorn. Not in so many words, but in ideas, in feelings, in shapes 
              and forms forgotten, and in those marvelous designs created in clay 
              so long ago. Caddo pottery gave her an instant connection to an 
              ancestral past she had never really understood before. But unlike 
              earlier Caddo potters, Jereldine had no knowledgeable elders to 
              turn to for guidance, no tight-knit group of female potters to work 
              with and learn with. So she set out on her own path, to find her 
              peoples' way back to the lost tradition.</p>
            <p class="text">Her brother had made simple coiled pots, so he spent 
              a day with Jereldine showing her what he knew. She read a few books, 
              but mainly she just started making pots. Her first pots were &quot;really 
              ugly&quot; she says today with a laugh, but she persisted. Her main 
              inspiration came from her ancestors through the Caddo pottery they 
              had made long ago. She was astounded to learn how many Caddo pots 
              had been dug up from the graves of her ancestors. She visited more 
              museums and talked with archeologists. They sent her books and articles. 
              From TARL came a rare copy of the 1962 <em>Handbook of Texas Archeology</em>, 
              with page after page of black and white photographs of Caddo pots. 
              &quot;Please donate it to the tribe when you do not need it anymore,&quot; 
              they told her. &quot;That was 12 years ago and I'm still using it 
              today&quot; says Redcorn, &quot;so I guess I'll have to put it in 
              my will to give it to the tribe.&quot; </p>
            <p class="text">Slowly, awkwardly, and painfully at times, she learned 
              to make Caddo pottery. Some of the steps, like burnishing and engraving, 
              were &quot;incredibly hard to learn&quot; and took her many years 
              to master. But she kept trying and kept getting better. And pottery-making 
              skills were not all she had to master. </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="text"><em>&quot;I went through stages. At first I was overwhelmed 
                and excited, a new world to our past had opened up. Later I became 
                angry, really angry at losing it [the pottery tradition] and at 
                what had happened to our people: the [tribe's] removals [from 
                Louisiana and Texas], boarding schools [which generations of Caddo 
                children were forced to attend to break the hold of Caddo culture], 
                the [U.S.] government and how they treated us. But as I made pottery, 
                I worked out a lot of conflict. I realized that we couldn't go 
                back, only forward. By reviving part of the tradition, you find 
                something that helps you look towards the future. [Realizing this] 
                gave me more excitement and joy. [And, I think,] no matter what 
                else, Caddo people are proud of me for doing this. This one thing.&quot;</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Born of a Caddo father and a Potawatomi mother, Jeraldine 
              Redcorn was raised in Colony, Oklahoma, on her grandmother Francis 
              Elliot's Caddo land allotment. &quot;We were 15 miles from most 
              of the other Caddos, which back then [1940s and 1950s] was a long 
              way. We lived closer to some of the Cheyenne and Arapaho people.&quot; 
              Apart from what she learned attending occasional dances, she did 
              not know much about her Caddo heritage early in life. The quest 
              for higher education took her to Plainview, Texas, where she earned 
              a BS from Wayland University and then to State College, Pennsylvania, 
              for her MA from Penn State. She married, raised a family, taught 
              school, worked in an early Oklahoma Indian Headstart program, served 
              on the Caddo Tribal Council, and was the founding director of Oklahoma's 
              annual Red Earth Festival. She taught high school geometry in Oklahoma City for many years before her recent retirement and today lives with husband Charles Redcorn (Osage) 
              in nearby Norman.</p>
            <p class="text">Having learned how to make Caddo pottery, one of Jereldine's 
              most important goals is to pass on the hard-won knowledge she has 
              gained to other Caddo women, especially younger women who could 
              keep the revival going. She has given lessons to several dozen women, 
              including her daughter, but so far she hasn't found an apprentice 
              who has both the determination and the love of pottery. &quot;It's 
              a difficult path, she laments, &quot;it takes a lot of time and 
              hard work.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; she says wistfully, &quot;it would 
              be so much fun to have a group of women working with me. I get so 
              excited now and it's just me. My fervent hope is to keep the tradition 
              going.&quot; </p>
            <p class="text">So she keeps moving forward, making pottery when she 
              can and working to perfect her craft. Sometimes life intervenes 
              and she must go months without making pottery. &quot;I feel like 
              something is missing, like a part of me is not there.&quot; As soon 
              as her hand are wet with clay again, her world feels right and the 
              passion comes right back.</p>
            <p class="text">Redcorn's husband, Charles, is her &quot;wood expert&quot; 
              who fashions pottery tools for her, gathers the right kind of fuel 
              wood, and helps her on firing day. He more than anyone has shared 
              her journey. She also credits archeologists for encouraging her 
              and helping her learn her craft. Don Wyckoff from the Sam Noble 
              Museum at the University of Oklahoma and Lois Albert from the Oklahoma 
              Archeological Society were among the first to see her early pottery. 
              &quot;I was just starting and I was not any good, but they were kind 
              and gave me hope that I could do this.&quot; She also visited the 
              museum where they gave her special access to the Caddo pottery collections 
              so she could study closely the tell-tale marks of the ancient maker's 
              pots. She also visited Jim Corbin at Stephen F. Austin University 
              in Nacogdoches, Texas. Corbin, a potter himself, freely shared what 
              he had learned about Caddo pottery with Redcorn. &quot;He sent me 
              home with sacks of Caddo clay and new ideas.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">Archeologists were also the first people who wanted 
              to buy her pottery. &quot;I would go to the Caddo Conference every 
              year and bring what I had made.&quot; At first she did not know anybody. 
              She and Charles attended a few talks and wondered how the archeologists 
              &quot;could sit there and listen to some of that stuff&quot; (the 
              normal reaction of any sane, non-archeologist and that of many archeologists 
              as well to mind-numbing details delivered in monotone.) Thankfully, 
              some of the talks she heard were more inspiring and she realized 
              some of the archeologists were as passionate about Caddo pottery 
              as she was. Soon she made friends and found that Caddo archeologists 
              (archeologists who study Caddo sites) were keenly interested in 
              what she was doing. They not only liked her pottery, but they bought 
              it. They also showed her more pictures, gave her more books, and 
              started asking her to replicate their favorite archeological pieces. 
              The Redcorn pots photographed for the modern Caddo pottery gallery 
              were all bought by Austin-based archeologists at Caddo Conferences.</p>
            <p class="text">Redcorn did not, of course, start making Caddo pottery 
              to make money. She really had no idea anyone would think enough 
              of her pottery to buy it. &quot;Up here on the Plains,&quot; she 
              says, &quot;there really is not a pottery culture today. There are 
              some good Cherokee potters, but it's not like the Southwest.&quot; 
              Vibrant local pottery culture or not, today Redcorn's pottery commands 
              hundreds of dollars and is on display in museums and in the homes 
              of archeologists and art collectors. Having retired in 2004 from her longtime job as a high 
              school geometry teacher, she now is able to fully concentrate on her craft.</p>

                    scraper. Later, she will use a wooden paddle and gourd anvil 
                    to further compact the clay and thin the vessel walls. Photo

                    several days earlier that she has allowed to dry to a leather-hard 
                    state. She uses a smooth pebble and a very thin clay wash 
                    during this step. The burnishing compacts and aligns the microscopic 
                    flat clay particles, forming a smooth surface. After about 
                    an hour and a half of concentrated effort, the surface of 
                    this bottle will have a nice lustrous polish. Photo by Rhonda

                  <div class="caption">The artist studies a bowl she has partially 
                    engraved and mentally plans how the two ends of the as-yet-uncompleted 
                    design will meet to form a flowing whole. She uses a pencil 
                    to trace a few guide lines to outline the main design elements. 
                    When she was learning the engraving process, she would spend 
                    hours trying to measure and plan each design to perfection. 
                    Now, she says, the designs &quot;are mine&quot; and she &quot;goes 
                    with the flow,&quot; meaning that she adapts the design to 
                    fit each pot as she goes with the confidence born of practice.
