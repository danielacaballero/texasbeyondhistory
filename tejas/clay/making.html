            <br><p class="text">Today pottery making thrives as a hobby, as an industry, 
              and as a form of artistic expression. Hundreds of books, films, 
              and websites exist that explain ceramic technology and pottery-making 
              techniques. But for those unfamiliar with the basic process and 
              those interested in the specific techniques favored by the ancient 
              and modern Caddo, here is a quick review. </p>
            <p class="text">The earthenware pottery made by the ancient Caddo 
              was made by hand using locally available materials and fired in 
              an open fire (as opposed to a kiln) at relatively low temperatures 
              (perhaps 600-700 degrees centigrade). Clay deposits suitable for 
              making pottery occur widely within the Caddo Homeland. In most areas 
              clay could be obtained easily from bluff exposures along rivers 
              and streams or by digging relatively shallow pits. Some clay deposits 
              are better suited for pottery making than others because they contain 
              fewer impurities or have useful properties such as the right degree 
              of plasticity (how easily wet clay can be shaped). Judging from 
              the copious quantities of Caddo pottery and from the high quality 
              of much of it, Caddo potters knew well where to find the proper 
              clays and how to prepare them. </p>
            <p class="text">Pure clay mixed with the right amount of water is 
              plastic (pliable) and can be easily formed into most any shape. 
              But most wet clays are so plastic that they won't hold a shape for 
              long before sagging and, as the clay dries, it tends to crack. A 
              further problem is that wet clay is very tacky and sticks to everything. 
              Like potters the world around, Caddo potters routinely solved these 
              problems by adding temper (non-plastic particles) to their clays 
              to help control the plasticity, to prevent drying cracks, and, in 
              some cases, to make their cooking pots withstand heat better. For 
              instance, relatively coarse temper was usually added to clays used 
              to make cooking vessels because the larger particles help the pots 
              take heat better than fine particles. The favored tempering agent 
              was grog (crushed potsherds). Burned and pulverized animal bone 
              was also used; burning is necessary in order to crush the bone properly. 
              After about A.D. 1300, burned and crushed mussel (freshwater clam) 
              shell was used as a temper by Caddo potters living along the Red 
              River and certain other areas. With practice, a potter learns just 
              how much of what kind of temper to add to create proper potter's 
              clay.</p>
            <p class="text">Once the clay mixture (paste) was ready, most Caddo 
              pottery was made using the coil method. First a flat disk was formed 
              that would serve as the base of the vessel. Rope-like fillets of 
              clay were then gradually coiled around the disk and mashed together 
              to form the vessel walls. The vessel walls were thinned, smoothed, 
              and compacted by the use of fingers, smooth river pebbles, shaped 
              sherds, or other tools. Redcorn uses dried gourds of various sizes 
              as anvils that she holds on the inside of a pot while she applies 
              a wooden scraper or wooden paddle on the outside to weld the coils 
              together, compact the clay, and form a smooth, even surface. </p>
            <p class="text">An experienced potter can make a simple bowl rather 
              quickly, in less than an hour. Large or complicated vessels take 
              many hours or even days to make because of the need to let the lower 
              parts partially dry before they are strong enough to add the upper 
              parts. When making larger pots with several different parts (like 
              long-necked bottles or vessels with tripod feet), Jereldine Redcorn 
              finds it best to &quot;put it [the half-made pot] away for a few 
              days. When you come back to it, all of the sudden it is wonderful.&quot; 
              What she means is that curing the still-damp pot (she wraps hers 
              in a plastic bag) makes it easier to work with when adding on necks 
              and other elements. &quot;The clay remembers,&quot; she says, and 
              holds its form. She suspects ancient Caddo potters did the same 
              thing, perhaps by wrapping their pots in wet animal skins. &quot;You 
              can make some pots much quicker, by just keeping at it, but it's 
              hard to get wet clay to behave the way you want it to.&quot; </p>
            <p class="text">Finishing the form of the pot is only the first step. 
              Caddo potters seemed to have delighted in finishing and decorating 
              their pots in many different ways. While the pot was still damp, 
              the surface was sometimes textured by brushing (useful for making 
              water jars and cooking vessels less slippery) or by pinching it 
              to form ridges. Other favored decorative techniques at this stage 
              included the use of a thin, sharp tool (like a flint flake) to incise 
              narrow lines, pointed sticks to incise broader lines or create deep 
              punctations, fingernails to create curving impressions, and hollow 
              pieces of cane or reed to create small circles. Another technique 
              used in later prehistoric times involved the addition of small shaped 
              clay fillets (appliqu&eacute;) or protruding &quot;nodes&quot; of 
              clay on the outside of the vessels to create raised relief.</p>
            <p class="text">Then the vessel was allowed to dry to what potters 
              call the green-ware stage. For the finer vessels, a second thin 
              layer of fine, untempered clay mixed with a red pigment called a 
              slip was sometimes added at this stage. The slip layer gave the 
              vessel a smooth, uniform appearance and sometimes a more desirable 
              color. Redcorn adds really fine clay slips to most of her pots to 
              enable her to create highly polished, mirror-like finishes that 
              those who buy her pottery seem to prefer. Ancient Caddo potters, 
              however, usually stopped well short of achieving highly polished 
              surfaces.</p>
            <p class="text">When the pot is completely dry (or almost so), the 
              green-ware vessel is burnished by wetting small areas of the outer 
              surface and rubbing the outside of the vessel with a small smooth 
              river pebble. This is a tedious and slow process, but one that results 
              in a vessel that has a lustrous appearance and a harder and less 
              porous exterior surface. Burnishing was usually done in parallel 
              strokes, up and down or side to side, leaving parallel burnishing 
              marks and a slightly uneven surface. If the potter was willing to 
              work hard enough and long enough, the burnishing marks could be 
              obliterated and the surface would become completely smooth and highly 
              polished. </p>
            <p class="text">Jereldine Redcorn found that learning how to properly 
              burnish a pot was one of her biggest challenges. Trials and errors 
              later, she now understands that burnishing must be done as a single 
              step without stopping. It takes her an hour to an hour and a half 
              to burnish a medium-sized bottle. She paints on small patches of 
              watery clay slurry and burnishes these quickly, adding one finished 
              patch to the next so she can make the burnishing look seamless.</p>
            <p class="text">Once the green-ware pot is completed and allowed to 
              thoroughly dry for several days, it is ready to fire. Ancient Caddo 
              pottery was apparently fired in an open bonfire, probably fueled 
              by wood and brush. Like most traditional potters, the Caddo women 
              probably fired more than one pot at a time. Whether the pots came 
              out with clear, bright, oxidized colors (red, yellow, light brown) 
              or dark, dull, reduced colors (gray, black) depended on how hot 
              the fire was and on the placement of the pots. (Clay type also factors 
              in to final color.) If the pots stayed hot after most of the fuel 
              had burned up, thus allowing air to reach the pots, they would become 
              oxidized. If the pots cooled while still covered by ash or up against 
              another pot, then they would have fire clouds and dark colors.</p>
            <p class="text">Redcorn likes to fire her pottery at a somewhat higher 
              temperature that her ancestors, in part because she usually uses 
              a higher quality commercial clay than her forebearers had access 
              to. She fires up to 15 pots at a time in a large metal barrel filled 
              with seasoned oak for intense heat and some fast-burning wood like 
              pine to get things going quickly. Her resident &quot;wood expert,&quot; 
              husband Charles Redcorn, gathers and prepares the wood. He also 
              helps her stack the pottery on different levels within the big barrel 
              to keep the pots from touching one another, to eliminate most fire 
              clouds. When she wants a black finish, she pours in a mix of sawdust 
              and powdered manure at the end of the firing to smother the fire 
              and create a reducing atmosphere.</p>
            <p class="text">After firing, ancient Caddo potters apparently engraved 
              some of their pots using a sharp flint tool like those used for 
              incising. Engraving leaves slightly rough-edged marks that cut through 
              rather than displace the outer layer of the pot through the slip 
              (if present). In contrast, incision and punctation displaces the 
              still-damp clay and leaves tiny ridges where the clay is pushed 
              up. The Caddo potters seem to have been very fond of incising and 
              engraving. They found many different ways to create pleasing decorative 
              effects by incising or engraving lines of different widths and depths, 
              adding tick marks, cross-hatching, parallel lines, curvilinear patterns, 
              and so on. To make the incised and engraved designs stand out, the 
              potters often rubbed mineral pigments, such as red ochre or white 
              kaolin clay, into the designs.</p>
            <p class="text">Jereldine Redcorn engraves her pottery after it is 
              polished and thoroughly dried, but before it is fired. Some archeologists 
              think the ancient Caddo did it that way too, although others hold 
              that engraving was done after firing. Perhaps it is mainly a question 
              of firing temperature and hardness. Vessels fired at higher temperatures 
              are just too hard to engrave, according to Redcorn. Becoming proficient 
              at engraving was the hardest thing she had to learn. She used bone 
              awls at first, but they kept wearing out and constantly needed resharpening. 
              Pieces of flint work, but are hard to hold on to. So today she usually 
              uses a metal awl. Part of the challenge of engraving is simply to 
              create nice even lines, particularly when they are closely-spaced. 
              She finds cross hatching to be &quot;very tedious&quot; and has 
              learned to take frequent breaks to let her hand rest.</p>
            <p class="text">But the real art of engraving lies in planning and 
              executing the design. For the first few years, Redcorn &quot;tried 
              too hard.&quot; She wanted to make her designs perfectly symmetrical 
              and spent a lot of time trying to lay out each design (with a pencil) 
              before beginning engraving. With experience she has learned &quot;to 
              just let things flow.&quot; She may trace out the major design elements, 
              but once she starts she does not try to make it perfect, &quot;just 
              look good.&quot; Once she has used a design enough times, &quot;it 
              becomes mine&quot; and she no longer has to think so hard about 
              it. &quot;I've learned to see the whole picture, the whole design, 
              and adapt it to fit each pot.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">The photographs accompanying this exhibit illustrate 
              these and some of the other variations and techniques used by Caddo 
              potters of yesterday and today.</p><br>
