                  <p class="text">About 1200 years ago (ca. A.D. 800), ancestral 
                    Caddo potters began making pottery that is unmistakably Caddo 
                    because of the particular combinations of material, design, 
                    and execution. Early Caddo pots were usually made of clay 
                    mixed with grog (pulverized pottery sherds) or sometimes bone. 
                    The vessels varied considerably in form and decoration, but 
                    two forms are particularly characteristic of early Caddo pottery: 
                    bottles with long, slender necks and carinated vessels, both 
                    bottles and bowls. &quot;Carinated&quot; vessels flare out 
                    from the base and then sharply turn inward toward the rim, 
                    creating a distinctively angled profile (side view) that resembles 
                    the V-shaped keel of a boat turned on its side. Both bottles 
                    and bows were usually polished and decorated with engraved 
                    and incised patterns. There were many variations as well as 
                    other forms and design techniques, but bottles and carinated 
                    vessels remained part of the Caddo pottery tradition for about 
                    a thousand years, from A.D. 800 to 1800.</p>
                  <p class="text">We now know quite a bit about the Caddo pottery 
                    tradition and how it changed over time. Archeologists have 
                    been amassing and studying ancient Caddo pottery for almost 
                    a century. Understanding or even just thoroughly describing 
                    the ancient Caddo pottery tradition is no easy matter. This 
                    is because, among other reasons, Caddo potters executed countless 
                    variations on a great many themes a 1000-year time span. And 
                    they made lots and lots of pottery. Every hamlet and village 
                    (and probably every extended family) had potters and there 
                    were dozens of Caddo communities. Just as there was no unified 
                    Caddo tribe until the late 1800s, there was not really a unified 
                    pottery tradition, but dozens of local traditions reflecting 
                    the diversity of Caddo peoples. Add it all up and it is reasonable 
                    guess that at least several million pottery vessels were created 
                    by Caddo potters. No grand synthesis has been written about 
                    Caddo pottery and there may never be one simply because the 
                    topic is so immense.</p>
                  <p class="text">Early historic accounts and cross-cultural studies 
                    suggest that the Caddo pottery tradition was created and maintained 
                    by women, as is the case among most comparable societies in 
                    the pre-industrial world. Caddo women probably passed on the 
                    tradition mother-to-daughter (or aunt-to-niece) from one generation 
                    to the next in much the same way that Caddo men passed on 
                    weapon-making and hunting skills to their sons (or uncles 
                    to their nephews). (Caddo kinship terms suggest that maternal 
                    aunts, the mother's sisters, probably played major roles in 
                    helping raise and educate their nieces, as did uncles with 
                    their nephews.) As you might expect, we find superb examples 
                    of pottery obviously created by master potters at the height 
                    of their abilities as well as really crudely-made pottery 
                    that is likely the work of unskilled girls just starting to 
                    learn. </p>
                  <p class="text">We also see a great deal of variation across 
                    the Caddo Homeland in part resulting from different clay sources 
                    and, more importantly, from different local or group traditions 
                    within the Caddo world. Some communities seemed to have favored 
                    particular forms and decorative styles more than others. In 
                    some cases these differences seem to have persisted through 
                    time, suggesting that different communities or groups maintained 
                    their own distinctive local traditions. </p>
                  <p class="text">As archeologists see it, Caddo potters made 
                    two kinds of pottery, fine ware and coarse ware or utilitarian 
                    pottery. The coarse wares were ordinary cooking and storage 
                    pots, made for everyday use. These were typically made rather 
                    plainly with thicker walls and coarse temper (see below) so 
                    they would be sturdy and, in the case of cooking pots, so 
                    they could be put directly on a cooking fire. Caddo fine wares 
                    were made to used in contexts where they would be admired. 
                    They were often polished, almost always decorated, had relatively 
                    thin walls and fine temper. Fine wares were used in serving 
                    food and drink and for special purposes, including religious 
                    ceremonies and to accompany the dead in the afterlife. It 
                    is mainly the fine ware tradition for which the Caddo were 
                    and are celebrated. </p>
                  <p class="text">(Caddo utilitarian pottery often was incised 
                    or engraved, especially in later times, but was not finished 
                    or decorated as nicely as the fine wares. Coarse wares are 
                    also found in a good many graves.)</p>
                  <p class="text"> Archeologist Frank Schambach thinks that male 
                    potters may have taken part in the Caddo fine ware tradition. 
                    He bases this idea on the finding of a grave at the Ferguson 
                    site in southwest Arkansas that contained three skeletons 
                    accompanied by large lumps and smaller patties of unfired 
                    clay (of two types), and five smooth pebbles. He interprets 
                    the artifacts as a potter's kit and notes that the principal 
                    individual in the grave was an adult male (the other two individuals 
                    are seen as those of retainers). While we cannot rule out 
                    the possibility that some Caddo potters may have been men, 
                    early and later historic accounts that mention pottery making, 
                    associate the activity with women.</p>

                  <h3>Why Study Caddo Pottery?</h3>
                  <p class="text">Why do the archeologists who study the ancient 
                    Caddo spend such an inordinate amount of time and effort excavating, 
                    reconstructing, and studying Caddo pottery? For archeologists, 
                    Caddo pottery is the prime evidence used to identify and date 
                    ancient traces of the Caddos' past. Lacking potsherds, we 
                    could scarcely identify the vast majority of Caddo archeological 
                    sites as being Caddo. While there are many other distinctive 
                    kinds of archeological evidence of Caddo life, such as house 
                    patterns, pottery remains indispensable for understanding 
                    the past for three main reasons. </p>
                  <p class="text">First, the ancient and early historic Caddo 
                    were superb potters and made and used lots of pottery. Sites 
                    representing small farmsteads where a single family once lived 
                    for short durations will have hundreds of potsherds. Villages 
                    and ceremonial centers often have tens or hundreds of thousands 
                    of potsherds and, in graves, many whole or almost whole pots. 
                    Secondly, pottery is relatively durable and can often be identified 
                    by style and form even when broken into small fragments. Thirdly, 
                    Caddo pottery is tremendously varied&#151;different forms 
                    or shapes, different decorative designs, different colors, 
                    different finishes, different sizes, and so on. Further, pottery 
                    styles and preferences changed through time and varied from 
                    place to place within the Caddo Homeland. Given the right 
                    sherd, an expert often can tell approximately where the pottery 
                    was made and how old it is, give or take a few centuries (or 
                    sometimes a few decades). This is because we know what whole 
                    Caddo pottery vessels look like.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddo pottery tradition was tied to the 
                    Caddo funerary tradition of placing whole pottery vessels 
                    in the graves of departed loved ones. The vessels may have 
                    contained food and drink to accompany the deceased in the 
                    afterlife or they may have been prized personal possessions 
                    (or both). Some burial pottery is obviously worn from use, 
                    but other vessels show no wear and look like they were interred 
                    in a fresh, newly made condition, perhaps representing gifts 
                    from loved ones. Whatever the case, the ancient Caddo must 
                    have considered pottery important because they included pottery 
                    vessels as grave offerings more frequently than any other 
                    non-perishable material. Clothing, mats, baskets, and objects 
                    made of wood may have been more common, but these things usually 
                    decay quickly. (The typically acidic soil in the Caddo Homeland 
                    destroys virtually all organic materials, including human 
                    bones, over time.)</p>
                  <p class="text">Whole pots are also found in other contexts 
                    besides graves, especially on the floors of houses. For instance, 
                    over 30 vessels of various sizes and forms were recently found 
                    on the floor of a house at the Tom Jones site in the Little 
                    River Valley in Arkansas. Most of these were broken by the 
                    collapse and burning of the house. (Many pots included as 
                    grave offerings are also broken.) For the archeologist, a 
                    reconstructed pot is every bit as informative as a never-broken 
                    vessel. </p>
                  <p class="text">The ancient Caddo tradition of including offerings 
                    of pottery in graves has led to the excavation of thousands 
                    of Caddo graves, some by archeologists and many more by looters 
                    (&quot;pothunters&quot;) seeking pottery for personal collections 
                    and, increasingly, to sell for profit. No one really knows 
                    how many, but tens of thousands of vessels have been removed 
                    from Caddo graves. Many are traded or sold on the antiquities 
                    market in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Some spectacular 
                    Caddo vessels are rumored to have sold for over $20,000. Even 
                    ordinary Caddo pots can bring hundreds of dollars on the market. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The desecration of Caddo cemeteries has long 
                    been a source of anguish to Caddo people (and Caddo archeologists). 
                    As explained in the &quot;<a href="../fundamentals/graves.html" class="text">Graves 
                    of Caddo Ancestors</a>&quot; section , the Native American 
                    Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990 has 
                    put the fate of most of the Caddo pottery vessels excavated 
                    from graves by archeologists in the hands of the Caddo Nation 
                    of Oklahoma. (NAGPRA applies to federal agencies, federally 
                    funded or permitted excavations, on federal and tribal land, 
                    as well as to all museums and institutions that have received 
                    federal funding. While this effectively covers most grave 
                    goods excavated by professional archeologists, the law does 
                    not pertain to graves dug up on private land or grave goods 
                    in private hands.) </p>
                  <p class="text">Caddo people are conflicted&#151;they want to 
                    honor their ancestors, but they are not sure that reburying 
                    all grave goods and bones in mass or separate graves hundreds 
                    of miles from their original resting places, as some tribes 
                    have chosen to do, is the right thing to do. Another possibility 
                    being considered by the Caddo is to expand their own tribal 
                    museum so that pottery vessels and other grave goods can be 
                    treated properly and preserved for future generations as sources 
                    of pride and knowledge about the past. </p>
                  <p class="text">Regardless of what happens in the future, Caddo 
                    pottery was important to the ancient Caddo, it is important 
                    to the Caddo Nation today, and it is important to anyone who 
                    wants to understand ancient Caddo history. </p>
                  <h3>Origin and Development of the Caddo Pottery Tradition</h3>
                  <p class="text">When we say that the Caddo pottery tradition 
                    began about A.D. 800, we do not mean to imply that earlier 
                    ancestors of the people known today as the Caddo were not already 
                    making pottery. Clearly they were. But we do not know exactly 
                    how, when, or even where, the Caddo pottery tradition was 
                    first established. Partly this is because it is often impossible 
                    to recognize the origin or beginning of any complex phenomenon 
                    in the ancient past. And partly it is because we have so few 
                    well-excavated and well-dated Late Woodland and early Caddo 
                    sites. </p>
                  <p class="text">In part, the Caddo pottery tradition grew out 
                    of the Fourche Maline pottery tradition that developed during 
                    the Middle and Late Woodland periods. Like early Caddo pottery, 
                    Fourche Maline pottery was usually grog or bone tempered and 
                    it was sometimes burnished. But Fourche Maline pottery was 
                    rarely decorated and it is very thick-walled in comparison 
                    to the Caddo fine wares. Vessel forms are also very different 
                    between the two traditions. Some of the favorite Caddo decorative 
                    techniques, incising and punctating, are found on Fourche 
                    Maline pots, but most of the designs are very simple. </p>
                  <p class="text">The inspiration for these decorative techniques 
                    almost certainly lies to the southeast in the Woodland cultures 
                    of the lower Mississippi Valley (LMV). Beginning with Tchefuncte 
                    pottery (800-200 B.C.) and continuing on into the Middle Woodland 
                    period (200 B.C. to A.D. 500) with Marksville pottery, incised, 
                    stamped, and puncated designs were common. Trade pieces of 
                    Tchefuncte and Marksville pottery are found in the Caddo area. 
                    By Late Woodland times (ca. A.D. 500-800/900) Fouche Maline 
                    potters began to copy the designs of Coles Creek pottery from 
                    the LMV. </p>
                  <p class="text">The origin of the technique of filling the engraved 
                    patterns with pigments and the origin of the distinctive early 
                    Caddo vessel forms&#151;long-necked bottles and carinated 
                    bowls&#151;is not known. We do not see clear precedents in 
                    the Woodland-period pottery of either the Caddo Homeland or 
                    the Lower Mississippi valley, or the central Mississippi valley, 
                    or the Arkansas Basin. Therefore, we suspect that one of two 
                    things happened: ancestral Caddo potters invented these techniques 
                    for themselves or they borrowed the ideas from distant cultures.</p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists have struggled with explaining 
                    the origin of highly specific behaviors for decades&#151;are 
                    these &quot;independent inventions&quot; or the result of 
                    the &quot;diffusion&quot; (spread) of ideas or of things like 
                    domesticated plants? In the 1940s, Alex Krieger and Clarence 
                    Webb, like many of their contemporaries, favored the diffusion 
                    explanation. These Caddo scholars and other prominent American 
                    archeologists of the day pointed to seemingly close parallels 
                    between Caddo pottery and the pottery of certain Mesoamerican 
                    cultures in what is today Mexico and Guatemala. They could 
                    not explain how the contact between these very different and 
                    widely separated (in space and time) cultures took place. 
                    Nor could they point to positive evidence of direct contact, 
                    such as the finding of a pot made in Mesoamerica at a Caddo 
                    site (or vice versa). </p>
                  <p class="text">Caddo archeologists today reject the notion 
                    of a Mesoamerican origin and see the Caddo pottery tradition 
                    as an independent development influenced only by neighboring 
                    peoples living mainly to the east along the Mississippi River 
                    and along the Gulf coast. The diverse Caddo pottery tradition 
                    bears witness to the obvious inventiveness of Caddo potters 
                    and their willingness to experiment. It is worth pointing 
                    out that there are a great many cases across the world of 
                    the obviously independent invention of specific forms of pottery 
                    making and decoration. Carinated pottery, long-necked earthenware 
                    bottles, and engraved designs with pigment all occur in many 
                    places in the world that are separated by thousands of miles 
                    or thousands of years (or both). For instance, carinated pottery 
                    forms similar to those of the Caddo tradition are also found 
                    in Mesoamerica, South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. </p>
                  <p class="text">Thus it seems likely that about 1200 years ago, 
                    ancestral Caddo potters began to develop their own distinctive 
                    pottery tradition by combining the established ways of making 
                    pottery (the Fourche Maline tradition and probably that of 
                    the Mill Creek and Mossy Grove traditions) with inspirations 
                    from neighboring peoples, and creative new ideas cooked up, 
                    so to speak, in Caddo villages by Caddo potters. By A.D. 1000, 
                    the Caddo pottery tradition was firmly established and distinct 
                    from all others. </p>
                  <p class="text">While some variation is apparent across the 
                    region, Early Caddo pottery seems to vary much less from place 
                    to place than would be the case a few hundred years later. 
                    Compared to the Caddo potters in later times (after A.D. 1400), 
                    early Caddo potters used fewer decorative techniques, applied 
                    decoration to larger areas of the surface of their fine wares, 
                    and left most of their utilitarian wares undecorated. They 
                    also favored bowl forms, especially carinated bowls, and bottles, 
                    although they made jars, plates, effigy vessels, and compound 
                    bowls, among other forms. Decorative designs were typically 
                    curvilinear, rectilinear, and horizontal. The relative homogeneity 
                    of early Caddo pottery is thought to be the result of broad 
                    and extensive social interaction among Caddo groups </p>
                  <p class="text">After A.D. 1400, Caddo pottery became more diverse 
                    in form and, especially, in decorative technique and style. 
                    Caddo potters developed (or borrowed) new decorative techniques 
                    including appliqu&eacute;, trailing (wide incisions, often 
                    curved), brushing, and a great many combinations. Intricate 
                    scroll designs with ticked lines, incised circles, negative 
                    ovals and circles, triangles, and ladder designs are all common 
                    in late Caddo pottery. Jar forms seem to have become more 
                    important and bottles somewhat less so. New specialized vessel 
                    forms such as rattle bowls and &quot;tail-rider&quot; effigy 
                    bowls appear, the latter closely resembling vessel forms in 
                    northeastern Arkansas. Very rare examples of Caddo pots made 
                    in the style of Mississippian head pots are also known.</p>
                  <p class="text">More than anything, the Late Caddo period was 
                    the time during which many local styles were created. In part 
                    this probably represents higher population levels (more people 
                    making pottery), but it also seems to reflect the existence 
                    of more social groups, each with its own local pottery tradition 
                    handed down and elaborated on from generation to generation. 
                    It is likely that the local styles were quite intentionally 
                    made different from one another as an expression of the identities 
                    of each Caddo community. Alice Cussens, daughter of Mary Inkinish, 
                    told a WPA interviewer in 1937 or 1938: &quot;each clan had 
                    its own shape to make its pottery. You could tell who made 
                    the pottery by the shape.&quot; [From David La Vere, 1998, 
                    <u>Life Among the Texas Indians</u>, where her name is given 
                    as Mrs. Frank Cussins. She was born in about 1885, by which 
                    time neither Caddo pottery making nor Caddo clans survived 
                    intact. Hence her words must reflect what she learned from 
                    her mother.]</p>
                  <p class="text">The invasion of European peoples and the attendant 
                    catastrophic impacts on the Caddo (population loss, forced 
                    moves, changing economy, etc.) brought about a relatively 
                    quick end to the Caddo pottery tradition. For a time in the 
                    late 17th and early 18th centuries Caddo women were able to 
                    keep making beautiful and distinctively Caddo pottery, but 
                    by the close of the 19th century, only vestiges of the tradition 
                    survived. The last Caddo pottery of the original tradition 
                    was apparently made in the late 1800s after the move to Oklahoma. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Today, as can be seen in other sections of this 
                    exhibit, there is hope that the Caddo pottery tradition will 
                    be revived, at least as an art form. Of course the tradition 
                    will never be the same without the existence of the societies 
                    that kept it going. Modern Caddo people use store-bought pots 
                    and pans, just like everybody else in the developed world.</p>

                  <h3>Classifying Caddo Pottery</h3>
                  <p class="text">Faced with an incredibly diverse and long-lived 
                    Caddo pottery tradition, archeologists have devoted much attention 
                    to classifying pottery into meaningful groupings of similar 
                    forms and styles. We do this because, by understanding differences 
                    in pottery style, manufacture, and form through time, we gain 
                    a better understanding of ancient Caddo societies. In doing 
                    so, archeologists try to balance the need for convenient labels 
                    for groups of similar pottery vessels, usually called &quot;types,&quot; 
                    with the need to recognize variation within and among types. 
                    This problem is not at all unique to Caddo pottery or even 
                    to pottery. Archeologists the world over need to classify 
                    artifacts into meaningful categories in order to communicate 
                    effectively and to be able to recognize and define artifact 
                    patterns across geographic space and over time. Countless 
                    scholarly articles and dozens and dozens of books have been 
                    written on the subject of classification. This archeological 
                    preoccupation need not concern us here, but you might want 
                    to know a bit about how Caddo pottery is classified.</p>
                  <p class="text">In this exhibit and elsewhere in the Tejas exhibits, 
                    the names of various pottery types, like &quot;Holly Fine 
                    Engraved&quot; and 'Maxey Noded Redware&quot; are often given. 
                    These type names are really nothing more that convenient labels 
                    for groups of pottery that share similar forms, similar manufacturing 
                    methods, and similar designs. The presumption is that particular 
                    types of pottery were made at roughly the same time and within 
                    specific areas (which may represent individual communities 
                    or many related communities). Types reflect, we archeologists 
                    like to say, the existence of &quot;mental templates&quot; 
                    or shared ideas of how a pot should be properly made, ideas 
                    that changed through time and changed from area to area. </p>
                  <p class="text">In Texas, pottery classification was first formalized 
                    when archeologists Dee Ann Suhm (now Story), Alex Krieger, 
                    and Edward Jelks got together in the early 1950s and put together 
                    what has become thought of as the &quot;bible&quot; of Texas 
                    archeology. It was originally introduced in 1954 as <em>An 
                    Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology</em> and had two 
                    parts. Part 1 reviewed what was then known about the archeology 
                    of different parts of Texas and Part 2 defined various major 
                    types of pottery and stone tools that archeologists had recognized 
                    in Texas and adjacent areas. In 1962, Part 2 was reissued, 
                    with larger pages and minor revisions, as <em>Handbook of Texas 
                    Archeology: Type Descriptions</em>, by Suhm and Jelks.</p>
                  <p class="text">It is unfortunate that, too often, the <em>Handbook</em> 
                    has been thought of, and used, as a bible whose type descriptions 
                    are set in stone, so to speak. Nothing could be further from 
                    the author's original intent&#151;to provide a good summary 
                    and first approximation of a useful classification system 
                    of pottery and stone artifacts. The <em>Handbook</em> was intended 
                    to be revised and supplanted by better information and new 
                    ideas&#151;the 1962 version was even issued in a ring binder 
                    so &quot;type sheets&quot; (most types are described on one 
                    side of a sheet and illustrated on the other) could be added 
                    and deleted as knowledge improved. This revision process did 
                    not happen, at least not in a consistent published form. Instead, 
                    each archeologist has interpreted and refined existing types 
                    and defined new ones to suit his or her immediate purpose. 
                    As we know more and more about the archeology of a region, 
                    the more impossible the job becomes to create a new and improved 
                    comprehensive handbook. While the existing <em>Handbook</em> 
                    is still useful as a general reference, many of its statements, 
                    educated guesses, and groupings are no longer considered valid.</p>
                  <p class="text">Since the 1950s archeologists gradually have 
                    realized that we ought to be paying more attention to the 
                    variability than the commonalities represented by &quot;types.&quot; 
                    The most common solution for pottery classification is the 
                    Type-Variety system. Basically, the &quot;types&quot; are 
                    the major groups of pottery that share similar attributes 
                    (look similar to one another), while the &quot;varieties&quot; 
                    are subgroups within types that have particular combinations 
                    of attributes (and look very similar to one another). Archeologists 
                    in Arkansas and Louisiana, especially those working in or 
                    near the lower Mississippi Valley, have spent much time defining 
                    many varieties of established types (as well as new types). 
                    This, too, has proved very cumbersome and difficult to keep 
                    up with. Plus, we can see that many types of attributes and 
                    even combinations of attributes occur in many varieties and 
                    types. Design &quot;motifs&quot; (such as nested centric circles 
                    or parallel ticked lines) in particular, seem to cross-cut 
                    existing groupings (types and varieties).</p>
                  <p class="text">And there is another, even more challenging 
                    problem. The Type-Variety system is based on whole pots, yet 
                    archeologists mainly find potsherds, thousands and thousands 
                    of pottery fragments. Whole pots are found mainly in graves, 
                    and archeologists today are more interested in excavating 
                    houses, middens, and other areas of Caddo sites where whole 
                    pots are rarely found. Given only a small fragment, perhaps 
                    no larger than a quarter or a half-dollar coin, how does the 
                    archeologist decide to which type, not to mention variety, 
                    the potsherd belongs? The short answer is that it is usually 
                    difficult if not impossible, hence archeologists have devised 
                    various, less-specific descriptive systems of classifying 
                    potsherds (plain bone-tempered sherds, decorated grog-tempered 
                    sherds, etc.) </p>
                  <p class="text">To address these problems, Arkansas archeologist 
                    Frank Schambach and several of his colleagues devised a more-detailed 
                    approach to describing and analyzing Caddo pottery that creates 
                    a hierarchy of &quot;classes&quot; and &quot;patterns&quot; 
                    of decorative techniques. This approach has proven useful 
                    in detecting fine-scale changes in pottery design through 
                    time along the Red and Ouachita rivers in Arkansas and Louisiana. 
                    At a class level, it can be applied to potsherds, although 
                    as the illustration to the right shows, at the pattern level 
                    the distinctions are based on what whole pots looked like. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Pottery classification is not a goal, it is 
                    a tool used to help understand variation and to help those 
                    interested in archeology communicate with one another. Establishing 
                    pottery types is just the first step. The steps that follow 
                    are more interesting, more important, and a lot more challenging. 
                    For instance, when archeologist Peter Thurmond took a close 
                    look at the pottery from a series of Late Caddo archeological 
                    sites in the Big Cypress Creek drainage system of northeast 
                    Texas and northwest Louisiana, he was able to define small 
                    geographic clusters of specific types and varieties of pottery. 
                    While all these clusters fall within the time period and area 
                    known as the Titus phase, they appear to reflect several of 
                    the actual Caddo societies of the day. Each cluster represents, 
                    we think, the territory of a social group equivalent to (but 
                    different from) the named groups encountered by the earliest 
                    European explorers a few centuries later. </p><br>
