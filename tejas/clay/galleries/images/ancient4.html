      <p class="btext">This unusual bottle combines a variety of decorative elements. 
        There are applied lobes at the top of each leg with punctations that form 
        a stylized face. Additionally, each leg of the tripod has punctations 
        around the base of the neck and there is an appliqu&eacute; band running 
        around the center of the lobe of each leg.</p>
      <p class="btext">A. T. Jackson and a crew from the University of Texas excavated 
        part of the Sanders site in Lamar County, Texas between July 23, 1931 
        and September 4, 1931. The site is located on Bois d'Arc Creek less than 
        a mile from the Red River and, at the time the work was conducted, had 
        at least two mounds. The landowner had plowed into several burials revealing 
        a variety of artifacts, which caught the attention of the UT crew while 
        they were in the area. The Tripod Bottle came from a group burial designated 
        Burial B-12. There were four adult and one child interred together. Additional 
        grave goods included five ceramic vessels, one celt, one arrow point, 
        two shell gorgets, and a variety of beads.</p>
