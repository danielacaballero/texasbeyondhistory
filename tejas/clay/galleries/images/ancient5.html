        W. S. Russell Site (41TT7)<br>
        ca. 1430-1600 A.D</p>
      <p class="btext">Height = 12.9 cm<br>
        Mouth Diameter = 15.5 cm</p>
      <p class="btext">This compound bowl has a flaring rim and inverted shoulders 
        over a carinated conical bowl. The entire vessel was covered with a thin 
        red slip of clay through which the design was engraved to create a more 
        dramatic effect. There are two engraved lines running horizontally around 
        the rim. In addition, four sun symbols are engraved on the shoulder of 
        the vessel with engraved panels acting as separators.</p>
      <p class="btext">The Russell site in Titus County, Texas was excavated in 
        August and September of 1930, by a crew from the University of Texas under 
        the direction of B. B. Gardner. The site apparently had a sizable Late 
        Caddo cemetery, but the skeletal materials were in such a poor state of 
        preservation only three burials had human remains. Forty-two additional 
        &quot;caches&quot; of ceramics and other artifacts were located, and assumed 
        now to be burials lacking preserved skeletal remains. It is not known 
        precisely where this bowl was found within the site.
