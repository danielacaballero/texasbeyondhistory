	<p>The people who built the ubiquitous cairns of west-central  Texas and the culture they represent remain veiled in mystery. The little that  we know about them derives largely from how they treated their dead, and the  offerings and weapons found in their graves. When these scant clues are woven  together along with information from other sites, we can draw a   slightly more focused view of these people and the times in which they lived. 
    <p>Based on the presence of several types of arrow points found  in a number of the burials, the cairn tradition in this region can be  associated largely with the Blow Out Mountain phase, dated from roughly A.D.  800/900 to 1300, although there are some indications it may have begun earlier. </p>
	<p>Blow Out Mountain peoples were hunter-gatherers,  subsisting on a diet including deer, rabbit and other small game, along with  freshwater mussels, and they apparently cooked their food in slab-lined  cooking features. Contact or trade with groups farther afield is signaled by the  presence of burial ornaments fashioned from exotic marine shell&mdash;conch columella  and <em>Olivella</em>&mdash;as well as a few bits of nonlocal stone found in graves. </p>
	<p>That people of this time carefully buried their dead in  cairn-covered graves  seems to reflect strong cultural traditions. From a larger  perspective, the establishment of cemeteries suggests they were claiming  specific territories in which to hunt and gather or, at minimum, designating  sacred points on the landscape for mortuary purposes, places where people returned time and  again to bury family and group members. </p>
	<p>More can be said about the Blow Out Mountain people by  considering what was not part of their lifeway, specifically the use of pottery  vessels, the hunting of bison, and the raising of crops such as maize (corn). There are no reported Blow Out Mountain sites  or cairn burials containing pottery sherds or bison bone.&nbsp;Also lacking are  Perdiz points and the distinctive end scrapers and beveled knives so common in  the region during the subsequent Toyah interval, after A.D. 1300. </p>
	<h3>Regional Migrations and Warfare </h3>
	<p>It is evident that the early part of the Late Prehistoric  period was marked by violence, as the region's cairn cemeteries bear testament.  Evidence of arrow wounds, mutilation of bodies, and the taking of war trophies  is not uncommon in the burials. Who the perpetrators where, and where they came  from, is an enduring mystery.&nbsp; What we do  know is that they used the distinctive Moran and Chadbourne arrow tips,  previously unknown to the area, to do their killing. The new points may signal  the coming of a non-local group vying for territory and resources, or perhaps merely  innovation by warlike locals.</p>
	<p>There are some indications that the aggressors may have come  from, or had ties to, the east. Stylistically, the Moran type arrow point, with  its parallel-sided to contracting stem, resembles points typically associated  with groups in north-central and east Texas, namely Alba and Bonham types.  The occurrence of similar points in west-central Texas may be related to the  early Caddo intrusion into the Brazos valley and beyond, groups which archeologist  Harry Shafer has termed the &quot;prairie Caddo.&quot; It may be significant  that the trait that seems to cross-cut, or distinguish, Blow Out Mountain arrow  point types and some of the others is serration of blade edges and  exceptionally fine workmanship on many of the points. </p>
	<p>Other intriguing hints of connections to the east come from  the <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/ancestors/early.html" target="_blank">Crenshaw site</a>, an early Caddo center on the west side of the Red River in  Arkansas. There, archeologist Frank Schambach investigated a phenomenon  diametrically opposite to the west-central Texas cairn graves&mdash;the burials of  numerous skulls and mandibles with no associated skeletal remains. And unlike  the cairn graves, the apparent trophy remains at the Crenshaw site had been  buried in numerous pits within one plaza area. The time period of this unusual  ritual activity appears to be more or less contemporaneous with the cairn  burials of the Abilene area. </p>
	<p>Is it possible to relate these Red River skulls to the headless and  mutilated skeletons in west-central Texas? Extensive analysis of the human  remains from Crenshaw, including chemical testing, indicates that the skulls  and mandibles found there are ethnically and culturally different from the resident  population at that site and surrounding communities.&nbsp;In that analysis, no  source area(s) for the trophy skulls was identified. Given that there are few,  if any, other known areas with burials lacking skulls/mandibles, west-central Texas  is a good candidate for the area of conflict. </p>
	<p>Whatever the nature of the prehistoric conflict that  accounted for these and other deaths, it was clearly not confined to a  particular region. During much of the first millennium A.D., violence was  widespread across much of Texas and the southern Plains, as groups moved into  other territories. &nbsp;Just beyond the  Abilene area, warfare is evident in the burials of individuals riddled with  arrow wounds. Some of these were placed in rock-lined or cairn-covered graves,  apparently similar to those of west-central Texas.</p>
	<p>A large cemetery at the Harrell Site in Young County in  north-central Texas contained mass burials of men, women and children whose  remains bore signs of trauma and trophy taking, including removal of skulls and  mandibles. A number of the burials were placed in slab-lined pits. However,  Scallorn arrow points, rather than Blow Out Mountain types Moran or Chadbourne,  were found in  some of the graves. </p>
	<p>In a northern Panhandle site on the Red River in Donley  County, two individuals were found buried in a cairn-covered grave. As reported  by excavator Adolphe H.  Witte in 1955, one individual was laid in sharply flexed  position, head downward atop the other, who had been placed in seated position.  Seven Scallorn-like arrow points&mdash;two in the first individual and five in the  torso of the other&mdash;were the apparent cause of death. </p>
	<p>Several cairn burials also have been reported to the  northwest in the Caprock Canyonlands and Texas Panhandle. At the Sam Wahl site  in Garza County, excavated by Douglas Boyd and others, the bundled remains of a middle-aged male were found in an  oval, cairn-covered pit. With the burial were a ground and striated piece of  hematite and a large (ca. 6 cm-long) Scallorn arrow point with serrated blade  edges, which lay on top of the disarticulated bones. </p>
	<p>In central Texas, and particularly along the Brazos Valley,  dozens of burials bear signs of violence, although few, or none, of the graves  were covered in stone cairns. At the Loeve-Fox site on the San Gabriel River,  archeologist Elton Prewitt uncovered a cemetery harboring the remains of 25  individuals. Scallorn arrow points were found in six of the burials, in  positions suggesting they were the cause of death. Conch shell pendants had  been placed in some of the graves as funeral offerings. </p>
	<p>Analyses of skeletal remains from the Loeve-Fox cemetery are  intriguing: the skulls were described as dolichocranic (very longheaded), as  were so many of the skulls from west-central Texas cairns. These similarities,  along with the findings from the Crenshaw site, underscore the need for a  large-scale assessment and comparison of cemetery populations. </p>
	<p>Along the northern edge of Edwards Plateau south of the Abilene area, cairn  sites also have been observed, but their function and chronology are largely  unknown. Oblong and oval cairns have been reported along the canyon rims of the  western plateau but most appear to have been disturbed, and none have been  systematically excavated.&nbsp;A series of 19 rock cairns in two clusters along a creek bluff in Kendall County were documented by Harry Shafer and Thomas Hester, and three were subsequently tested. Both large and small stones  filled and capped oval pits thought to have once held burials. Although no human remains were found,  the absence was attributed to poor preservation. Similar cairns in a linear arrangement were recorded on a high slope in Bandera County. </p>
	<p>Although we may never know the particulars of the Late Prehistoric conflict evidenced in the west-central Texas cairn graves, we can surmise that it wreaked consierable havoc on  hunter-gatherer populations. As Lawrence Keeley points out in his book, <em>War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage</em>,  prehistoric warfare may have been small-scale by modern standards &#8212;more akin to raiding by small groups pushing territorial boundaries&#8212;but it was every bit as deadly as later warfare among  &quot;civilized societies.&quot; When hunter-gatherer conflict escalated, it  could be devastating to the small societies involved. <br>
	</p>
	<h3>Toyah and Beyond </h3>
	<p>Beginning around A.D. 1300, the Late Prehistoric II Toyah  interval &nbsp;was a time of continued extensive  interaction among groups from far-flung areas, and much of it appears to have  been centered over west-central Texas.&nbsp;This cultural milieu is reflected  most dramatically in the diverse ceramic types relating to groups in Central  Texas, the Henrietta focus to the north, Frankston focus to the east, and Rio  Grande pueblo peoples to the northwest. A distinctive tool kit also was carried  by the Toyah folk, including Perdiz arrow points, small chipped-stone scrapers,  and beveled knives. These specialized tools reflect the increased importance of  bison and the burgeoning hide trade in the region. </p>
	<p>There is no agreement among archeologists about the  derivation of this late, and eventually widespread, cultural expression.  Several, however, have suggested that it may have developed among local groups  in west-central Texas, based on similarities between Moran points and Perdiz  points. Archeologist Doug Boyd has also pointed to similarities with Deadman's  points of the neighboring Palo Duro complex. Based on their shape, it has been suggested that either Deadman&rsquo;s and/or Moran points may  be ancestral to the Perdiz arrow point, emblematic of the subsequent Toyah  interval. </p>
	<p>For whatever reason, the cairn burial tradition appears to  have come to an end in west-central Texas before the full emergence of the  Toyah complex. In the Trans-Pecos area to the west, however, there is evidence  of a later cairn burial tradition. Two remarkable cairn graves apparently  related to the Cielo Complex, ca. A.D. 1400-1750, contained the remains of two  individuals, both placed in shallow, rock-covered pits on high promontories.  Unlike the Abilene area graves, however, these burials each contained a sizable  and elaborate trove of grave offerings. </p>
	<p>At the<a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/trans-p/images/ap11.html" target="_blank"> Las Haciendas</a> site in northeastern Chihuahua, a young  man was buried under a covering of limestone chunks and two large rhyolite  boulders placed in a gabled position. An offering of 194 arrow points, most of  them Perdiz, a drilled malachite pendant, and a kaolinite bead, had been placed  in a cluster under the head. At the Rough Run site near La Jitas, Texas, a more  elaborate stone slab cairn was built to cover the partially dismembered remains  of an adult male. The 300 rhyolite stones used in the cairn had been carried  from a nearby outcrop and transported to the burial site. Some 60 Perdiz arrow  points and a Harrell point were placed within the grave. </p>
	<p>
	  Cairn features also are prevalent in the Lower Pecos region,  although most have been disturbed. In a survey of Seminole Canyon State Park,  archeologist Solveig Turpin recorded a number of circular and oblong cairns  along canyon rims and in high settings with panoramic views. Many were at sites  that also contained stone circles.&nbsp;Excavation of one cairn at site 41VV364  revealed a shallow pit covered by layers of large rock slabs and smaller  stones.&nbsp;Although there were no bones in the pit, high phosphate levels in  the soil suggested human remains had once been present.&nbsp;A fragmentary  Perdiz point was located in the bottom of the pit, and another was recovered  from screening of the burial fill, along with two dart points. </p>
	<h3>Future Research </h3>
	<p>Much more remains to be learned about cairn burials, their  derivation, and possible connections with other traditions. Critically lacking  are stratified sites in west-central Texas to help us understand the Late Archaic  to Late Prehistoric transition as well as the cultural upheavals of the latter  times. There is considerable stylistic variation in the Moran point type and  insufficient chronological information. In the same vein, a substantial  modification of the Blow Out Mountain concept may be warranted. As presently  understood, it may encompass too much chronological and cultural variation to be considered a single cultural period. </p>
	<p>The possibility of gathering additional archeological data  from systematic excavation of a cairn site, however, is not great. It appears  that most of the cairn burials of west-central Texas already have been  disturbed, if not destroyed, by artifact collectors. This careless activity has  resulted in a tremendous loss of information. While some collectors take the  time to document what they find, most dig up graves only looking for potential  grave offerings, with little regard to any human remains they may encounter. </p>
	<p>Today, archeologists rarely excavate burials except in  circumstances required by federal and state cultural resource laws or as  necessitated by emergency salvage. When they encounter graves during cultural  resource management projects, such as survey for reservoir construction and  transmission lines, they routinely consult with the Texas Historical  Commission. As a rule, most professional archeologists in Texas hold the view  that human graves should be protected by law and left untouched except when  unavoidable or with particularly good cause, such as a significant research  question that can only be answered by studying graves. Determining who the  mysterious cairn people were&mdash;and what became of them&mdash; may be just such an  issue.</p>
