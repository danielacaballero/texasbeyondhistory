      <td width="480" valign="top"><p>Known among archeologists as Alexander&rsquo;s Covered Mound,  Site 41JS73 is a large cairn cemetery or group of cemeteries along a high rocky  escarpment west of the Clear   Fork River.&nbsp;Cyrus Ray excavated four cairns  at the site in the 1930s, and archeologist Joe Ben Wheat excavated another  series of cairns  in approximately the same area several years later.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>
          In total, as many as 20 individuals were buried at site 41JS73,  some in multiple graves within the same cairn. There was considerable variation  in how the individuals were interred  and, based on presence of arrow points and missing skeletal elements,  it is evident  that some met a violent death.&nbsp;  Several skulls were  buried without other body parts, some skeletons lacked skulls, and mandibles were missing on some.   Based on written descriptions, the arrow points may have been of the Moran type. </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>1930s Work by Cyrus Ray</strong>          </h3>
        <p>Ray conducted excavations on successive visits over a  period of several years. Brief notations on his findings thought to be from  this site are within articles in Texas Archeological and Paleontological  Society bulletins in 1933, 1939, 1940. Ray numbered the four cairns as&nbsp; AM#1, AM#3, AM#4, and AM#5 (AM#2 was located  elsewhere).&nbsp; There is only scant  information on the locations of these cairns  relative to one other.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>AM#1:</strong>&nbsp; The remains of  five individuals were found within this cairn mound.&nbsp; Previously disturbed by relic hunters, some  graves contained only fragmentary remains. The first grave in the central  portion of the mound had been badly damaged. The second, in the northern  sector, contained fragmentary remains within a slab-lined, rectangular cist  with a horizontal slab covering and vertical slabs erected above.&nbsp; Skull fragments were found the near the top  of the cist, and a few bones at the bottom. </p>
        <p>
          In the western portion of the mound, a complex grave  containing remains of two individuals was found. A rectangular, slab-lined cist  with a horizontal slab covering had been placed at a depth of about four feet  below the stone mound visible on the surface. The cist contained a flexed skeleton in seated position  with both hands on sides of the skull. One of the mandibles was  missing from the skull.&nbsp; On top of the slab covering  this cist, additional vertical slabs had been erected. Roughly&nbsp; 18 inches above these and below other  vertical slabs, the remains of another individual had been interred in flexed  position, on its side.&nbsp; Only the skull,  mandible, and other skeletal elements were present.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>AM#3:</strong>&nbsp; This feature was multi-layered, with  cobbles stretching roughly 6 feet across atop two  parallel, upright slabs  set on edge with additional flat stones.&nbsp; Beneath this covering, at a relatively  shallow depth (about 20 inches), was a flexed skeleton on its back. According to  Ray, the left femur showed much evidence of bone disease in the form of <em>exotoses</em> (bony outgrowths) and the head of the bone was described as &ldquo;deformed, much  mushroomed, and eroded.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>
          <strong>AM#4:</strong>&nbsp; A total of 65  stone slabs in complex arrangement covered this single burial. The individual  lay in flexed position with head to the south in a pit roughly three and a half  feet deep. At least two layers of horizontal slabs covered the pit, and these  were covered with vertical slabs, with additional slabs placed at varying angles. The  entire stone cairn extended about seven feet in diameter. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>AM#5:</strong> This cairn, located roughly 18 inches from AM#4,  contained four burials at different levels within a large, stone-covered pit  nearly five feet deep. In the northeast portion, a large skull lay on top  of what Ray described as a &ldquo;much smaller skull;&rdquo;&nbsp; next to these were two arrow points characterized as long, thin, and  serrated.&nbsp; The long bones of the skeletons were mixed below  the skulls.&nbsp; A third skull, with no other  bone, lay in the southeast end of the pit. Another skeleton lay in the west end  along with three serrated arrow points. According to Ray, the points were like those  shown in the 1939 BTAPS Bulletin (Plate 51), from a site now recorded as  41JS1.&nbsp; The illustrated points are    Moran type, associated with the Blow Out Mountain phase. </p>
        <h3>
          <strong>Excavations by&nbsp; Joe  Ben Wheat </strong></h3>
        <p>
          Wheat conducted excavations at the site in 1940 as part  of a WPA archeological project in the Abilene  area.&nbsp; In his quarterly report for the  project, he described his findings in considerable detail.&nbsp; Two different burial groups were  situated roughly 300 yards apart. The first cairn group (labeled Site 1), encompassed four cairns containing nine  burials.&nbsp;An additional burial was found nearby (Site 2). </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cairn 1</strong> held three burials,  including the bundle burial of an adult male placed as if in the arms of a  female, who had been interred in a seated position. The man was approximately  40 years old at time of death.&nbsp; His  remains apparently had been allowed to deflesh, then the major bones gathered  and deposited amid the burial of the female.&nbsp;  The skull, minus the mandible, was placed upside down on the pile of  bones. &nbsp;In Wheat&rsquo;s view, these burials  were made at the same time. Several  inches below this dual grave lay the bundle burial of another individual, a female  adult.</p>
        <p> 
          <strong>Cairn 2</strong> contained a cremation  burial within a small niche of the rock mound, the burial of an infant, and the  fully flexed burial of an adult male. The remains of the man had been badly  crushed by the overlying rock slab, and only fragments of his skull could be  accounted for.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cairn 3</strong> covered a slab-lined pit,  which had been subdivided, and contained the remains of two individuals: a child  and a male adult.&nbsp; The child had been  placed in flexed position on its left side atop a layer of flat stones in the  upper part of the pit. Three <em>Olivella </em>shell beads accompanied this child. &nbsp;The remains of the man had been placed in  seated position within a cist lined by five slabs set at a sharp angle. &nbsp;In Wheat&rsquo;s estimation the burials within this  cairn were made at different times.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cairn 4</strong> &nbsp;contained the flexed remains of a child buried  atop flat stones within a pit. The burial was covered over with a great mass of what Wheat described as &ldquo;shingled&rdquo; rocks.&nbsp; The skeleton had been  badly crushed by the weight of the stones; the entire cranial vault and most of  the vertebral column were missing.</p>
        <p>
          A second plot (Site 2) &nbsp;contained one &ldquo;massive burial&rdquo; at a shallow  depth. This included the remains of an adult man in flexed position, and that  of another adult, probably originally in flexed position. </p>
        <p>Artifacts and field notes from the excavations are curated at Texas Tech University. Plans are underway to photograph some of the artifacts, particularly the arrow points, and will be added to this section when available. </p>
