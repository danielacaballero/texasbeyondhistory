        <p>When local landowners in Shackleford County  discovered a low pile of rocks extending over an area roughly 40 feet in  diameter, they were concerned it might contain a burial. &nbsp;The University of Texas Department of Anthropology  was notified and investigations were carried out in 1936.</p>
        <p>A.M. Woolsey of U.T. and a &nbsp;crew hired by R. E. Forrester conducted  excavations in this group of four rock cairns, recovering the primary burials  of four adults. A datum stake was placed in the approximate center of the cairns, and distances  measure in outward from the stake. </p>
        <p>The interred individuals had  been arranged in varying positions in graves averaging 50 inches in length, 34  inches in width, and 24 inches in depth. All had been laid in flexed position,  with legs drawn up tightly. Three individuals lay on left side and one on right. None  had the same orientation, although heads were generally to the west.</p>
        <p>Several unusual aspects  were noted among the cairns.  One (AZ-3) featured a rather complex stone enclosure with a low-lying slanted &ldquo;roof&rdquo;  of flat rocks over the skeleton. A stone pendant recovered from burial AZ-4 is  particularly notable, as grave inclusions in cairn burials are rare.&nbsp; Analysis of the human remains at TARL by  Barbara Jackson indicated two were adult females, one an adult male, and one an  adult of indeterminate sex. Notably, the lower jaw was missing from one of the  individuals. Documented in other burials of the region, this pattern may be attributed  to the taking of &ldquo;war trophies.&rdquo; </p>
        <p>General descriptions of the four burials are given  below.&nbsp; Additional details are included  in Woolsey&rsquo;s report from TARL Records, which can be downloaded here as a <strong><a href="Woolsey pdf.pdf" target="_blank">pdf file.</a> </strong></p>
        <h3>Burial AZ-1 </h3>
        <p>Covered by the most extensive layer of rock among the four cairns, this grave<strong></strong>  contained the partial remains of  an adult male. He appeared to have been laid on his right side, with legs flexed such that the  heels were under the buttocks. The pelvic bones were &ldquo;flat on the grave.&rdquo; Woolsey  noted that the skull was in a fair state of preservation, although it was  &ldquo;loose from the body and placed with its top down.&rdquo; The lower jaw was missing,  along with left hand and upper right arm. A portion of the skull was found some  18 inches away. </p>
        <h3>Burial AZ-2</h3>
        <p>Situated the farthest from the center stake (46.5 feet) and  deepest below surface (33 inches), Burial AZ-2 was enclosed by a &ldquo;fence-like&rdquo;  arrangement of five rocks placed on end. Within this, rocks had been laid flat  as a covering over the body of an adult female. She had been placed on her left  side in east-west position, with head to west, somewhat tilted upward and  facing north. Although the skull was crushed in from the side, Woolsey noted it  was otherwise in good condition, and the teeth in excellent condition. Feet  were badly decayed, as was the left hand, which appeared to have been placed  under the chin; the right hand was missing. No artifacts were found within the  burial but four badly decayed mussel shells were found outside the rock  enclosure.</p>
        <h3>Burial AZ-3</h3>
        <p>Removal of scattered surface rocks in this area revealed a  rather elaborate stone enclosure roughly 6 inches below. Measuring circa 2.5 by  1.5 feet, it was described by Woolsey as &ldquo;a sort of quadrangular fence of  rocks&hellip; three of them being placed at the east end, and a layer of two all the  rest of the way around.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within this,  four flat rocks had been laid in slanted position, forming a low &ldquo;gable or  triangle&rdquo; over the skeleton.&nbsp; A rock 16  inches long and 12 inches wide had been placed over the chest. The skull was  encountered about one foot below the surface and about an inch below the overhanging rock  &ldquo;roof.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>The remains in Burial AZ-3 were those of an adult female, with   head to the east. The body had been placed on its left side, with the head to the west, and the top of the head up &quot;as if it had been bent up to fit in the grave, which was too short.&quot; The legs were flexed and knees to the north.&nbsp; Woolsey noted that the face was not facing  in the direction of the bearing of the body but was looking almost north. The  skull was in fair condition, although cracked at every suture. Teeth were in place in both jaws,  although the lower jaw was resting on the bottom of the grave.</p>
        <p>
          The interpretation of the sloping stones as a gabled roof over  this burial is peculiar, based on observations at other cairns in the region. A number of burials  were found covered with flat stone slabs, laid horizontally over the grave.  Atop this, upright flat stones extended above the present surface. It is  possible that upright stones at AZ-3 slumped inward over time, creating the  unusual alignment. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <h3>Burial AZ-4</h3>
        <p>Covered by a low pile of rocks some 8-10 feet in diameter,  this cairn was roughly 25 feet from the center stake. As at the other cairns, excavation  revealed a low fence made of vertical rocks encircling the grave, and a large  flat rock and a few smaller ones over it. The body had been placed on left side  with bearing almost exactly north to south; head was at south end. A number of  skeletal elements were missing, including shoulder blades, collar bones, ribs,  vertebrae, and portions of arm bones.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In the chest area of this individual (possibly a woman) was  a groundstone ornament with holes at each end for suspension.&nbsp; Measuring 2.75 by 5.25 inches, the object was  made of material described as either dark shale or slate.</p></td>
