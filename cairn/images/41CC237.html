      <td width="480" valign="top"><p>Site 41CC237 is an isolated burial cairn containing the  remains of two individuals, an adult and child. Located on a high bluff rim  along the upper Colorado River, near its  confluence with the Concho, the site was notable for its spectacular view of the  river valley. Recorded by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., during the survey phase  of recreation areas for the Stacy Reservoir project, the site was tested by Mariah  Associates archeologists during the subsequent 1989 cairn assessment program.  (Stacy Reservoir later was renamed O.H. Ivie Reservoir.)</p>
        <p>Although distinguishing the cairn stones from  natural limestone was difficult, a  noticeable attribute of the cairn was a slight mound which rose about 30 cm above the  bedrock. Stones  in the mound feature ranged from 5 to 45 cm in diameter. </p>
        <p>Excavations   revealed the cremated remains  of a child  roughly 10-15 cm above the articulated remains of an  adult male. Absence of scorching on the  adult's bones strongly suggested the child had been cremated elsewhere. </p>
        <p>The man appears to have been placed in  flexed position within a shallow pit, then covered with  backfill and rocks. Several small cobbles resting on bedrock formed a rough  circle around the burial. </p>
        <p>There were several indications that the adult burial was  not primary. Certain elements were not in correct alignment (e.g., the long  bones and extremities were southwest of the cranium and the vertebral column  was articulated below and to the east of the cranium), and numerous elements (e.g.,  mandible, both scapulae, right femur, right patellae, etc.) were missing.&nbsp; For these reasons, it was determined that the  skeleton was not in its original position, but rather had been reburied in the  cairn from another location.&nbsp; Said  differently, the burial was a secondary interment rather than a tightly flexed  primary interment.</p>
        <p>Within the burial cairn, archeologists found a rich array of cultural materials including 9 chipped-stone tools  made of Edwards chert, a handful of debitage, several pieces of limonite and  hematite (mineral pigment), 18  <em>Olivella</em> shell beads  (recovered during  screening of the fill), freshwater clam shells, land  snails, and a small quantity of animal bones (deer, rabbit, and fish). </p>
        <p>Among  the stone tools were two thin bifaces, one with serrated edges, a side scraper,  an end scraper, and  flake tools. The limonite slab was found in four refittable pieces;  striations and smoothing patterns suggested it had been used, broken in two,  and further used at the cairn. The deep scratches likely represented scrapings  of mineral powder from the limonite, possibly for a burial ritual. Four species of freshwater clams also were  scattered throughout the burial fill; only three shell fragments showed  indications of burning or heat alteration. Twelve of the <em>Olivella</em> shell beads had ground spires and  four contained a faintly incised line paralleling the upper whorls.&nbsp;The presence of these marine gastropod shells in the burial indicates contact with peoples far afield or trade networks.</p>
        <p>Physical anthropological studies on the human remains  indicated that the burned bones were from a four-to-five-year-old child (based on  a single incisor tooth and certain bone fragments), and the adult was a male,  aged 20-25 years. A v-shaped incision on the interior surface of a rib fragment  suggested possible dismemberment. Based on a study of C12/C13 fractionation  from bone collagen from the adult male, his primary diet was deer, nuts and  berries. </p>
        <p>Radiocarbon dating on a collagen fractionation sample from the adult left femur, indicates the age of the burial was approximately  1500 years (1525+/-145 B.P.). This  date falls within the latter part of the Late Archaic or the beginning of the Late Prehistoric I period. Whether the interments of the adult male and the cremated remains of the infant occurred at the same time is not known. The burial events could have occurred together or many years apart. </p></td>
