      <td width="480" valign="top"><p>Situated on a high, grassy ridge overlooking the Clear Fork of the Brazos River, this  cemetery site contained four complex cairn burial features.  The remains of 20 individuals were identified, some showing signs of violent death, and some accompanied by grave offerings. </p>
        <p>The four cairns were located within close proximity to one another within an area littered with camp debris. Cairn Number 1 was situated on top of  the hill, Number 2 some 100 feet to the west, Number 3 ca. 200 yards south of  Number 1, and Number 4 roughly 100 feet northeast of Number 3. &nbsp;Of the four, all but one  contained multiple burials.  </p>
        <p>The site was excavated periodically by Cyrus Ray and others  throughout 1929-1937. In articles published in the <em>Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society</em>&nbsp; (BTAPS), Ray variously termed the features  &ldquo;Covered Mound,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rock Mound Burial&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stone Slab Cist Mound  Burials.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term <em>cairn</em> is used here. </p>
        <p><strong>Cairn Number 1</strong> contained five individuals buried in four graves.&nbsp; The first (1A) was a cluster of small bone and  teeth fragments from a cremation. Ray observed that the burned bone fragments were &ldquo;in such oval symmetrical form as to suggest it  originally rested in a bag&rdquo; or other perishable container. The age and sex of the individual was not   determined, although Ray described the interred as an  infant in one BTASP article.    The remains had been placed in a pit and  covered with a horizontal stone slab about 3 feet below the surface. A few mussel  shells were then placed atop the slab.&nbsp;  Several large vertical slabs were set close together on top of the stone  covering, and these extended above ground surface. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>A second burial (1B) in the western portion of the mound contained  a similar arrangement of stone slabs. Underneath a square flat covering  stone lay two flexed adult skeletons, one directly on top of the other, and aligned in  opposite directions.&nbsp; Both apparently had  been interred together, with the rock slab covering only their torsos. </p>
        <p>The upper individual was an adult (sex  unreported) who had been placed on right side, with head to the south and facing east.  The lower individual, a male roughly 35-54 years old, had been placed on his  left side, with head to the north, facing east.&nbsp;In addition to the human remains, mussel shell fragments  were found &ldquo;here and there,&rdquo;<strong> </strong>according  to Ray.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Burial 1C&nbsp; was located  in the southeastern portion of the mound and contained an arrangement of rock  similar to those in 1A and 1B, with a horizontal slab covering only the body  portions. The grave held the flexed remains of two individuals, an infant and a probable adult female, along with varied grave offerings. The infant lay on its left side with head to  the north and facing east.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The   adult was placed with head to the north,  and facing south. Five  unmodified mussel shells lay near the long bones, which were against the chest.  Near the left shoulder was a cache of items,  likely held originally  in a  perishable container, such as a leather pouch or net bag. Among these were deer  antler tools (flakers, awls); a quartzite abrading stone; a triangular chert biface; and chert scraper.&nbsp; Both the  stone tools were patinated.</p>
        <p><strong>Cairn Number 2 </strong>held   two individuals, an infant and probable adult female, placed in  flexed positions with heads to the west. &nbsp;A slab had been laid   horizontally over the torsos, about 3 feet deep in  the grave; additional slabs were then placed vertically atop the slab cover, in an arrangement similar to Cairn  Number 1.  The adult reportedly lay  on left side with head facing north. Incised bone beads, probably made of turkey  humeri, were found under the jaw bone and may have been strung on a necklace. Bones of the infant were in poor condition.</p>
        <p><strong>Cairn Number 3</strong> contained eight flexed burials (3A, B, and C; 3F, G, H, I, and J) and&nbsp; two bundle burials (3D and E). The first  three flexed burials were found in stone slab cists buried four feet deep. Age and sex of the flexed burials were not reported but were likely adults.&nbsp; A possible bison bone (cuboid-navicular) was recovered  from one grave.
		
        Cairn 3D contained parts of a skull and a bundle of bone  fragments lying under a top layer of stone. Cairn 3E, found nearby, at a depth of  about 15 inches, contained a skull and bundle of bones, as well as an arrow point  in the center of the ribs. As shown in the photo at top right, the point was a long, slender type Moran,  with a parallel-sided stem.</p>
        <p>Below the two bundle burials were five additional flexed  burials, each apparently within a separate pit covered with a separate  horizontal slab. Atop each of the five slabs, stones had been placed in  vertical alignment for about three feet. A single grave inclusion, a bone awl,  probably from a deer or antelope metapodial, was found with one individual.</p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, the mandibles, or jaw bones, were missing from  five of the 10 skeletons in Cairn 3.&nbsp; This may reflect a ritualized pattern&mdash;such as the taking of symbolic war trophies.</p>
        <p>Based on cranial data  on four skulls from Cairn 3 studied by physical anthropologist M. S.  Goldstein, two were males, about 30 years  old; one was a roughly 25-year-old female with a partially healed gash over  one eye; and the fourth was a child roughly 3 years of age of indeterminate  sex. </p>
        <p>An eleventh burial (3K), excavated in 1937, was described as  an additional cist containing remains of another skeleton, in a poor state of  preservation. Ray reported the bones had been gnawed on and scattered by  rodents, and the remaining bones were too fragmentary to reconstruct. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Cairn  Number 4</strong> was a relatively shallow slab cist burial of a  single individual, placed in a flexed position. Bones were poorly preserved and  no age or sex information was reported.&nbsp;  Against and outside of the right forearm wrist area were a fragmentary  marine conch shell pendant with a central perforation and decorations on edge,  and a fragmentary polished stone artifact, described as a boatstone or  atlatl weight. </p> </td>
