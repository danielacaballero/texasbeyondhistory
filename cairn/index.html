    <td width="480" valign="top"><p>The countless stone mounds dotting the low hills and flat-topped mesas of  west-central Texas have perplexed landowners and archeologists alike for more  than a century.&nbsp; Known as &ldquo;cairns,&rdquo; these  mysterious arrangements of rock can be found by the hundreds&mdash;and perhaps thousands&mdash;along the  rocky ridgelines and bluffs overlooking the broad valleys of the Brazos and  Colorado rivers and the canyons of their tributaries.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Area ranchers typically have  referred to these large cairn clusters as &ldquo;Indian burial grounds&rdquo;&#8212;and with good reason. Many of the cairns have been found to contain  human remains&#8212;men, women, and children who long ago were carefully interred in specially prepared graves. </p>
      <p>The term <em>cairn</em> harks back to Old World usage describing a mound of stones erected as a  memorial or marker.&nbsp; Although similar  stone configurations have been observed in other regions of the state, those in  the general vicinity of Abilene  are distinctive in their quantity, scale and complexity.&nbsp; Varying widely in size, west Texas cairns typically have a  discernible circular shape. They usually are located on prominent elevations that afford  both panoramic vantage points and ready access to stone outcrops; indeed,  several archeologists have noted the spectacular views afforded by the location of  many of the cairns.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Puzzling though they may seem to us today, these   hilltop cemeteries mark special places on the landscape&#8212;sacred territory where  kin and comrades  once gathered for  rituals and memorials. They speak to a little-known prehistoric era of human turmoil, transition, and rivalry, a Native American world that  existed in the centuries before  the entry of Europeans into the region and the arrival of the Comanche and Apache.</p>
      <h3><strong>The Land and Resources </strong></h3>
      <p>In west-central Texas,  much of the cairn burial distributional area lies within the southern portion  of the Rolling Plains and includes part of the Edwards Plateau. The region is bounded by the Edwards Plateau  canyonlands to the south and the Western Cross Timbers to the east.&nbsp; Steep cliffs and canyonlands of the Caprock  Escarpment mark the transition to the High Plains to the west. Cutting  through the cairn region and separating the Brazos and Colorado   River drainages from each other is a major landform known as the Callahan Divide, a low range of  mesas roughly 25 miles long. As aptly described by archeologist Robert Mallouf,  the Divide appears to &ldquo;rise from the surrounding redbed plains like a massive flat-topped  fortress ranging from east to west as far as the eye can see.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>
         In the northern  portion of the cairn region, the valley of the Clear Fork of the Brazos  expands over a mile wide in some areas, while tributary streams and gullies  create jutting promontories. In the southern sector, the Colorado is fed by the clear waters of the  Concho and many smaller tributaries. </p>
      <p>
        The region is rich in natural resources that would have attracted people to  the area.&nbsp; The wide river terraces and  bluffs provided ideal camp sites with ready access to water, fuel wood, high-quality  chert for tools and weapons, and a variety of plants and animals. Outcrops of eroded limestone and sandstone afforded an inexhaustible source  of rock for building  cooking features and  cairns.</p>
      <h3>Tracing Patterns </h3>
      <p>
        Cairn burials in this region appear to be mainly a Late Prehistoric phenomena dating  from roughly A.D. 800 to about A.D. 1300, although there is some evidence suggesting the tradition began earlier. Beyond that tenuous time frame, there  is little known about the culture that created them, or the circumstances of  the deaths of those buried there. &nbsp;In a  few burials there is clear evidence of conflict&mdash;arrow points still embedded in  bone.&nbsp; Some skeletons lack mandibles,  skulls and other elements, suggestive of a pattern of trophy taking seen  throughout the greater Plains region during the Late Archaic and early Late  Prehistoric times. But it is not at all certain that most of the burials are those of the victims of intergroup violence. </p>
      <p> 
        Our understanding of the cairn phenomenon is hindered by several  problems.&nbsp; Most of the sites have been disturbed, if not destroyed, by relic collectors.&nbsp; Only a handful have been systematically  excavated by archeologists and, of those, a relative few have yielded diagnostic artifacts that might inform us of the culture from which they derived.</p>
      <p>
        Much of the investigation into cairn burials was done in the 1930s-1940s by  archeological pioneers Cyrus Ray and E. B. Sayles. As dedicated as these early  researchers were, their findings are difficult to associate with specific locations and provide little useful information to help address questions of cultural  connections.&nbsp;Since that time, cairn excavations have been limited, arising largely from discoveries made during reservoir projects in the area. </p>
      <p>
        In the 1980s, archeologist Darrell Creel began a focused effort to search  for and document cairn sites  along the Middle Concho  River. He delved into the archives of the Texas  Archeological Research Laboratory, attempting to correlate the often cryptic field notes and sketch maps left by earlier researchers with the extensive artifact collections they had amassed.&nbsp; His quest evolved into a decades-long effort to  reassess dozens of previously recorded cairn sites and plot them on modern maps and to document new ones.  &nbsp;</p>
      <p>Based on the presence of early-type arrow points and other evidence in some of the graves, Creel  believes cairn burials are related to a regional cultural expression he termed the Blowout Mountain phase, a   volatile time period coinciding with increased movements of peoples across the  Plains. As this exhibit demonstrates, much research still remains to be done to gain a more  realistic view of the scale and parameters of cairn burials and the culture  they represent. </p>
      <h3>In This Exhibit</h3>
      <p>The following sections highlight much of what is known about  cairns of west-central Texas including information from unpublished reports  and manuscripts, journal articles of the 1930s and 40s, and more recent archeological  reports. Much of the imagery, including artifacts and photographs, has not been previously available and is drawn together in hopes of guiding future research. </p>
      <p>The<a href="investigations.html"> Investigations </a> section focuses on  efforts to record and excavate the sites and   discern patterns in this cultural expression. <a href="explore.html">Explore the Sites</a> enables viewers to learn more about many of the excavated cairn  sites via an interactive map. <strong><a href="deconstructed.html">Cairns Deconstructed</a></strong> synthesizes the extensive variation in structure and mortuary traditions represented in these features. <strong><a href="cultures.html">Cultures, Conflicts, and Connections</a> </strong>considers  patterns in a broader context and the possible architects of this cultural  phenomenon. <a href="credits.html">Credits and Sources</a> acknowledges researchers and contributors and provides references and links for learning more  about topics covered in the exhibit.</p></td>
