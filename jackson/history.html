                  <p class="text">Around 1840, wealthy Virginia planter Abner 
                    Jackson brought his wife, Margaret, and their 5 children and 
                    slaves to Brazoria County, Texas, to begin work on their first 
                    plantation, Retrieve. Soon after, they began buying the land 
                    for their second plantation and palatial home, to be nestled 
                    in the bend of a picturesque oxbow lake between the Brazos 
                    River and Oyster Creek. First called the Lake Place, it later 
                    came to be known as the Lake Jackson Plantation. </p>
                  <p class="text">By all accounts, the Lake Jackson Plantation 
                    was an elegant complex with a columned, colonial style main 
                    house, brick outbuildings, ornamental gardens, and a state-of-the-art 
                    sugar mill. Jackson's eye for detail and quality was described 
                    in a 1926 chronicle by Abner Jackson Strobel, the grandson 
                    of Margaret Strobel Jackson and step-grandson of Abner Jackson:</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p class="text"><em>Major Jackson &#133;opened up the Lake 
                      Jackson Plantation during the period 1842 to 1845. His first 
                      home was made of logs from the nearby forest, mostly elm 
                      and ash. He soon, however, converted every building, cabins, 
                      sugar house and residence into brick made on the plantation, 
                      and stuccoed with cement fully an inch thick, which made 
                      all the buildings look like they were made from solid rock. 
                      </em></p>
                    <p class="text"><em>The residence was a twelve room two-story 
                      house in the shape of an &quot;I,&quot; with six galleries, 
                      and immense brick pillars the entire length of the galleries. 
                      [T]he residence cost, exclusive of slave labor, over twenty-five 
                      thousand dollars completed.</em></p>
                    <p class="text"><em>&#133;The sugar house was built of brick, 
                      and the best of machinery for the making of sugar was obtained. 
                      There was an artificial island made in the lake, said to 
                      have cost $10,000 . Fine orchards and gardens were on the 
                      plantations&#133;. Brick walks were laid in the orchard 
                      and garden. The slaves had use of both orchards and gardens. 
                      </em></p>
					</blockquote>
                  <p class="text">By 1850, the Lake Jackson plantation had grown 
                    to 3,744 acres. The land was ideal for sugar growing&#151;fertile, 
                    well-watered, and easily cleared. In 1852, Jackson produced 
                    295 hogsheads of sugar with horse-drawn machinery at the Lake 
                    Plantation. Jackons and his partner, James Hamilton, produced 
                    an additional 450 hogsheads at Retrieve. (A hogshead is a 
                    barrel containing roughly 1000 pounds of crystallized sugar.)</p>
                  <p class="text"> In 1857, Margaret Jackson died. Jackson asked 
                    his children and stepson not to claim their share of their 
                    mother's estate because he wanted to continue expansion. The 
                    same year, Jackson purchased the Darrington Plantation for 
                    $116,200. A year later, the sugar mill at the Lake Jackson 
                    plantation was upgraded with the addition of a steam engine 
                    in 1858. </p>
                  <p class="text">Prosperity and abundance ruled for a brief period. 
                    In 1860, census takers listed Jackson as owning 285 slaves, 
                    making him the second largest slaveowner in the state. His 
                    other holdings were valued at $172,775. </p>
                  <p class="text">But death and the Civil War brought an end to 
                    the Jackson family's fortune. Abner Jackson died in 1861 deeply 
                    in debt. Probate records indicate that during the Civil War, 
                    John C. Jackson (the eldest son) tried to hold the estate 
                    together and pay off debts when funds were available. When 
                    the war ended, George W. Jackson (Abner's third son, four 
                    years John's junior) returned home. John C. was in control 
                    of the estate and would not turn over any part of it to George. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"> In September, 1867, a court order enabled George 
                    W. Jackson to gain control of the Lake Jackson plantation, 
                    but conflict remained between the two brothers. In December, 
                    1867, George W. killed his brother John C. during a confrontation 
                    at the Lake Jackson plantation. George W. was never prosecuted 
                    for the murder and he died of tuberculosis on November 7, 
                    1871, in Galveston.</p>
                  <p class="text">Wm. J. W. Masterson became executor of the estate 
                    of Abner and Margaret Jackson. An attempt to hold the estate 
                    together was made, but documents indicate that debtors were 
                    demanding payment. Subsequently, the estate was sold piece 
                    by piece.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1873, William W. Phelps of New York bought 
                    the Jackson Plantation from the estate of George W. Jackson 
                    and his sister, Asenath Jackson Groce, for $20,800. Phelps 
                    sold the property to A.J. Ward and E. D. Dewey for $36,000 
                    that same year.</p>
                  <p class="text">After the Civil War, Texas adopted a system 
                    of leasing state convicts to private companies and individuals. 
                    Although the system was an effective means of replacing slave 
                    labor, it often resulted in deplorable treatment for the prisoners, 
                    including some at Lake Jackson. In 1871, the state leased 
                    the Huntsville State Prison and all of its prisoners to Ward, 
                    Dewey &amp; Co. of Galveston for a 15-year-period. They in 
                    turn leased convicts to the Lake Jackson Plantation. </p>
                  <p class="text">An 1874 inspection of the Lake Jackson Plantation 
                    and its prisoners found many of them to be ill and without 
                    medical attention. The inspector found that three convicts 
                    had been severely beaten on their backs; that prisoners were 
                    not being fed well; that a guard had pledged his own credit 
                    to procure meat for the convicts; that convicts had not changed 
                    their clothing for 10 weeks and that some could not cover 
                    their extremities; and that some prisoners slept on bare mattresses 
                    without cover. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1875, Edward H. Cunningham and Littleberry 
                    A. Ellis formed a partnership. They contracted with the state 
                    of Texas to lease the entire convict population. Those convicts 
                    they did not use were subleased to other plantations. Their 
                    partnership and use of convict labor was the beginning of 
                    the Imperial Sugar Company of Sugar Land, Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">When state prison inspector J.T. Gaines made 
                    his rounds in December, 1876, he reported that three convicts 
                    had died at the Lake Jackson Plantation: one while being punished 
                    in the stocks, one in an escape attempt, and one from natural 
                    causes. Prison records for 1882 list the Darrington Plantation 
                    with 28 convicts and the Lake Jackson Plantation with 36. 
                    The last listing for convicts at Lake Jackson was on November, 
                    1884, with a total of 33.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1900, the Lake Jackson Sugar Company took 
                    over the four acres containing the &quot;sugar house, including
