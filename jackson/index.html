                  <p class="text">On the lush banks of a tranquil lake on the 
                    upper Texas Gulf coast, the crumbled ruins of brick buildings 
                    are all that remain of a once thriving plantation. The business 
                    of the plantation was making sugar: thousands of pounds of 
                    sugar cane grown in the fields were processed in the plantation's 
                    mill. First African-American slaves, then convicts from nearby 
                    prison farms provided the backbreaking labor to make the industry 
                    profitable in the fertile coastal land known as the &quot;sugar 
                    bowl of Texas.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">Built by Abner Jackson and his wife, Margaret, 
                    in 1844, the Lake Jackson Plantation became one of the most 
                    profitable sugar refineries in the state. Over time, Jackson 
                    expanded his namesake property to almost 3750 acres and acquired 
                    two additional plantations, Darrington and Retrieve. But massive 
                    debt and murderous family rancor ravaged the Jackson business, 
                    and Lake Jackson plantation eventually had to be sold. Subsequent 
                    owners struggled with the upheaval in business brought about 
                    by the Civil War, a changing economy and a new labor force. 
                    In 1900, the infamous hurricane that killed over 6,000 people 
                    in Galveston also delivered the final death blow to the plantation, 
                    nearly leveling many of the stately buildings and sugar mill 
                    complex. Although the land continued to be cultivated for 
                    crops and later was used as range land for cattle, the buildings 
                    were never reconstructed. </p>
                  <p class="text">Nearly a century later, archeologists began 
                    probing the weed-infested ruins, hoping to learn more about 
                    the plantation and the technology of sugar making. Joan Few, 
                    professor at the University of Houston at Clear Lake, has 
                    directed excavations at the site near Freeport, Texas, since 
                    1992. Now a State Archeological Landmark, the property includes 
                    the remains of 12 structures on roughly four acres of land&#151;a 
                    mere shadow of the original plantation. </p>
                  <p class="text">Through the efforts of hundreds of volunteers 
                    and students, including members of the Texas Archeological 
                    Society (TAS) and the Brazosport and Houston archeological 
                    societies, much of the elaborate brick-walled plantation and 
                    mill complex has been uncovered, allowing researchers to track 
                    changes in construction through time. Significantly, archeologists 
                    learned to recognize the finer craftsmanship of the slave-labor 
                    era, as distinguished from the poorer quality work produced 
                    by convicts. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today there are no nineteenth-century sugar 
                    mills standing in Texas, but archeological research at Lake 
                    Jackson has provided a wealth of information on the first 
                    industry in Texas, that of refining sugar. </p>
                  <p class="text">Missing from the archeological record, however, are 
                    the stories of the black slaves who provided the sweat and 
                    labor to create the Jackson empire. Because the slave quarters 
                    were located on the other side of the lake, they were not 
                    explored during archeological excavations. For this reason, this exhibit does not delve into the histories of the &quot;Black Jacksons.&quot;  These families&#8212;the descendants of John Jackson, oldest son of Abner and Margaret Jackso&#8212;gather  at the plantation each June and maintain their family histories. In her recently published book, <em>Sugar, Planters, Slaves, and Convicts,</em> Few devotes several chapters to the history of the Black Jacksons based on both historical records and interviews with family members. </p>
