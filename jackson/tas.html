                  <p class="text">Conducting two TAS field schools at the Lake 
                    Jackson State Archeological Landmark (LJSAL) required strategic 
                    planning worthy of a military campaign, coordination between 
                    a bevy of &quot;stakeholders,&quot; and, of course, lots of 
                    labor and luck. These efforts paid off in significant archeological 
                    accomplishments, field education for beginners, and many good 
                    times. Good fortune smiled on the project as well: the humidity 
                    was low, the nights were surprisingly cool, and the mosquitoes 
                    and alligators decided to clear out when the TAS moved in! 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The 1994 and 1995 TAS field schools were conducted 
                    at the Lake Jackson plantation and sugar mill complex as well 
                    as at the nearby Follet Lake site. These field schools provided 
                    the TAS membership with two types of archeological opportunities: 
                    the chance to excavate the structural remains (i.e. brick 
                    walls) of a Texas antebellum sugar/cotton plantation or to 
                    work on a massive late prehistoric <em>Rangia</em> shell midden. 
                    Along with archeological operations and training provided 
                    to novices, there was the usual fun and antics among the crews.</p>
                  <p class="text">The two &quot;Clute sisters&quot; (i.e. Andie 
                    Comini and Brenda Whorten) made their zany debut at these 
                    field schools. Wearing outlandish wigs and costumes, they 
                    dropped into every work area at the field school bringing 
                    smiles from weary, heat-exhausted workers. And who could forget 
                    Andie Comini's motor home? It resembled a large Gateway computer 
                    box on wheels with accompanying long horns and braying trumpet? 
                  </p>
                  <h3>The Long Road to the Starting Line</h3>
                  <p class="text">Long before field school could set up and excavations 
                    begin, however, there were months of preparations. Members 
                    of the Brazosport Archeological Society (BAS) and Houston 
                    Archeological Society (HAS) battled the elements and tropical 
                    critters to prepare the site. In an environment rich in heat, 
                    humidity, snakes, mosquitoes, and virulent poison ivy, these 
                    hardy crews cleared away vegetation and huge expanses of brick 
                    and rubble prior to the actual field school.</p>
                  <p class="text">There were tactical hurdles as well: strings 
                    of meetings, planning sessions, debates, reevaluating, compromising 
                    and ultimately agreement among the major stakeholders of the 
                    proposed field schools. Each had a role and significant interest 
                    in the operations; each made a major contribution to the efforts. 
                    In addition to the TAS field school committee and BAS and 
                    HAS members, there were the Lake Jackson Historical Museum 
                    (owner of the LJSAL); the City of Lake Jackson (owner of the 
                    park where camping and programs were held); the Texas Historical 
                    Commission (administrator of LJSAL's archeology); Brazosport 
                    College (site of the 1994 archeological lab); and Brazosport 
                    Museum of Natural Science (site of the 1995 archeological 
                    lab and temporary repository for all the artifacts found at 
                    the LJSAL and Follet Lake site.</p>
                  <p class="text">Last but not least among interested parties 
                    was the Dow Chemical Company (owner of the Follet Lake site, 
                    provider of funds for both years' major speakers, and, perhaps 
                    most importantly, the underwriter of each year's Porta-Potty 
                    expenditure!)</p>
                  <p class="text">These stakeholders were singly and as a group 
                    presented with the most optimistic vision of what the two 
                    TAS field schools would look like. Buy-in by all stakeholders 
                    was essential if these field schools were to be successful. 
                    And, as was demonstrated by each stakeholder, their ardent 
                    support for the field schools went far beyond what was expected 
                    of them.</p>
                  <h3>Learning Opportunities Unlimited</h3>
                  <p class="text">Both field schools provided the participants 
                    with opportunities to learn more about the two sites being 
                    investigated through presentations and demonstrations. In 
                    addition, prominent Texas ar-cheologists gave talks about 
                    work they performed on other sites in the region. To add to 
                    these learning experiences, a special presentation was given 
                    each year. In 1994, Edwin C. Bearss, Chief Historian of the 
                    National Park Service, Washington, D.C., discussed his work 
                    in discover-ing and raising the sunken Union Ironclad, the 
                    USS Cairo. </p>
                  <p class="text">At the following year's field school, ceramics 
                    expert George L. Miller led a workshop in historic ceramics. 
                    Known for his nineteenth-century ceramic cost indexing (an 
                    economic approach to interpreting ceramics from archeological 
                    sites), Miller attracted a number of people who registered 
                    for field school solely to be present at this workshop. Some 
                    drove from as far away as New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, 
                    Oklahoma and Kansas to attend. Typically, his workshops are 
                    given on the East Coast, are much smaller, and thus more difficult 
                    to attend. The all-afternoon presentation was done &quot;in 
                    the round&quot; and is still touted by Miller as his largest 
                    ever workshop. </p>
                  <h3>Kids and Divers Explore New Realms</h3>
                  <p class="text">Participants in the children's program maintained 
                    a strong presence during both field schools. Younger children 
                    worked on Building A, the storehouse. They exposed the double 
                    brick floors of this building and opened several smaller units 
                    adjacent to the building. These children also toured many 
                    county historical sites and museums and, on two occasions, 
                    somehow ended up at Surfside beach and the jetties. Older 
                    children with years of field experience were integrated into 
                    many of the adult crews. There were reservations at first 
                    about doing this, but it turned out to be a successful change 
                    in operations.</p>
                  <p class="text">The work of the underwater archeology crews 
                    (which came to be known as the TAS Navy) attracted attention 
                    as well. Braving muck and a tangle of aquatic plants, Brenda 
                    Whorton and assistants surveyed the bottom of the oxbow lake 
                    to determine if it could have been smaller during the nineteenth 
                    century and used a magnetometer to look for anomalies. Their 
                    efforts paid off: they discovered the original road (now underwater) 
                    leading from the sugar mill to the other side of the lake 
                    where the slave quarters and other buildings were located.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although the divers had been assured that there 
                    were no alligators present, the critters apparently returned 
                    soon after the TAS field school cleared out. The very day 
                    after field school ended, Joan Few learned that a 5-foot alligator 
                    was spotted in the lake!</p>
