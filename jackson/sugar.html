                    that turned the juice of sugar cane into granulated sugar. 
                    Sugar cane is not native to the Americas. Its origin lies 
                    in Southeast Asia. Christopher Columbus brought sugar cane 
                    to the island of Santo Domingo on his second voyage, and from 
                    there it spread to North, Central, and South America. </p>
                  <p class="text">When Moses Austin visited the Spanish Governor 
                    in San Antonio, Texas, in 1820, he expressed his hope of bringing 
                    300 families to Texas to raise cotton and sugar. The Governor 
                    knew that sugar cane would grow in Texas&#151;a small sugar 
                    mill already had been established at Mission San Jose y San 
                    Miguel de Aguayo in San Antonio sometime before 1755. Although 
                    Moses Austin received his impresario grant, he died soon after 
                    his return to Missouri, leaving his son, Stephen, to assume 
                    his father's mission. Stephen F. Austin traveled to Texas 
                    to choose the best land to raise sugar cane: the land near 
                    the Brazos and Colorado Rivers. The alluvial soils of this 
                    Gulf Coast Plain were a source of great wealth for the sugar 
                    planters. The Brazos and San Bernard rivers, Oyster Creek, 
                    and numerous meandering bayous, provided transportation. </p>
                  <p class="text">By 1828, the first sugar mill in Austin's Colony 
                    had been established and by 1850, there were 45 large plantations 
                    producing millions of pounds of sugar a year. African-American 
                    slaves provided most of the labor. The Civil War devastated 
                    the sugar economy in Texas. After the war, Texas planters 
                    began to revive the sugar industry using convict labor. The 
                    Imperial Sugar Company began with the 1875 partnership of 
                    Edward H. Cunningham and Colonel Littleberry A. Ellis. To 
                    operate their sugar lands, they leased the entire Texas prison 
                    population and sublet those laborers they did not need. In 
                    the 1890s, Colonel Cunningham built a mill and installed the 
                    machinery needed to refine sugar. In 1905, it became Cunningham 
                    Sugar Company and in 1917, the Imperial Sugar Company.</p>
                  <p class="text">Sugar production in Texas peaked in the 1880s 
                    and declined afterwards as the trend toward consolidation 
                    of sugar mills developed. The industry took a bigger blow 
                    in 1910 when a new law prohibited the leasing of any convicts; 
                    thus the sugar mills lost the majority of their work force. 
                    Sugar cane is no longer grown commercially along the upper 
                    Texas Gulf coast. Nonetheless, the Imperial Sugar Company 
                    in Sugar Land, Texas still refines sugar imported from Hawaii, 
                    Louisiana, and Puerto Rico.</p>
                  <h3><a name="1"></a>From Stalk to Sugar: The Sugar-Making Process 
                  </h3>
                  <p class="text">Sugar was made in nineteenth-century Texas mills 
                    by a very involved and complex process. The first stage&#151;extraction&#151;entailed 
                    squeezing the juice from ripe sugar cane with steam-powered 
                    crushers. The juice was pulled by gravity from upstairs crushers 
                    to the first floor vats. The earliest mills in Texas used 
                    horsepower to drive wooden rollers to extract the cane juice. 
                    In 1843, the first steam-powered mill was established on Captain 
                    William Duncan's Caney Creek plantation.</p>
                  <p class="text">The second phase of sugar production was the 
                    reduction process which requires a fire, a train of progressively 
                    larger kettles, and the flue chimney. Heat was produced by 
                    a fire under the smallest of the kettles (usually about 6 
                    feet in diameter). The heat was then pulled by the height 
                    of the chimney through the flue under the kettles to where 
                    it exited up the tall chimney. The molten sugar scum was repeatedly 
                    skimmed from the top of each vat as the liquid was passed 
                    on down to the smallest kettle.</p>
                  <p class="text">The final phase of the sugar process was granulation, 
                    cooling, and purging, which took place in the purgery&#151;a 
                    large space attached to the reduction room to hold cooling 
                    trays and vats. When the syrup in the smallest and hottest 
                    kettle began to crystallize, it was removed into cooling trays. 
                    Cooling trays were usually wooden troughs about 10 feet long, 
                    5 feet wide, and 10-12 inches deep. After about 30 days, the 
                    uncrystallized syrup,or molasses, was drained into a molasses 
                    barrel leaving behind crystallized sugar.</p>
                  <h3><a name="2"></a>Investigating Historic Mills</h3>
                  <p class="text">With knowledge of the sugar-making process, 
                    archeological investigators formulated specific research questions 
                    prior to beginning excavations at Lake Jackson. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text">What was the layout of the original Lake 
                      Jackson mill? Was it similar to or different from other 
                      sugar mills in Texas?</li>
                    <li class="text">How was the mill changed when steam power 
                      was added? The historic record documents the addition of 
                      steam power to operate the cane crushers. Where were the 
                      boiler, boiler chimney and engines located? </li>
                    <li class="text">How was the mill altered after the Civil 
                      War when steam replaced fire as the source of heat in the 
                      reduction process?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text">Prior to excavating the Lake Jackson mill, three 
                    historic Texas sugar mills&#151;Bynum, Osceoloa, and Varner-Hogg&#151;were 
                    mapped to distinguish similarities and differences. Although 
                    all are in ruin, the remains are substantial enough to identify 
                    the main components. </p>
                  <p class="text">Osceola Mill is the best-preserved mill and 
                    made identification of the shared attributes of the other 
                    mills possible. It was determined that all three are long 
                    and narrow and have cisterns close to them. They all have 
                    the flue chimney outside the structure and they are all divided 
                    into two parts, the crushing area and the purgery. At Osceola 
                    and Bynum, the boiler chimneys could be identified; both are 
                    outside the sugar mill. </p>
                  <h3><a name="3"></a>Tracing the Sugar Making Process at Lake 
                    Jackson </h3>
                  <p class="text">To recap, the three processes in making sugar 
                    are, extraction, reduction, and crystallization. The <b>extraction 
                    process</b> extracts the juice from the sugar cane. This process 
                    is done with large iron crushers that were powered by a horse-powered 
                    treadmill attached to the crushers or by a steam boiler which 
                    provided steam power to turn the cane crushers. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The historical records state that Jackson began 
                    the mill using horsepower to run the cane crushers that extracted 
                    the juice from the cane. The tallest part of the mill ruins 
                    was the foundation for the massive cane crushers placed on 
                    the second flour. As investigations got underway on the brick 
                    floor next to the cane crusher foundation, excavators uncovered 
                    horse harnesses and large metal bands. </p>
                  <p class="text">Although records indicate that Jackson installed 
                    a boiler to steam power the cane crushers, neither the boiler 
                    nor the boiler chimney were found during extensive excavations. 
                    All evidence indicates that the horse-powered treadmill was 
                    still in place when the mill was destroyed by the 1900 hurricane.</p>
                  <p class="text">The second phase of sugar making is the <b>reduction 
                    process</b> that boils the cane juice until the juice crystallizes 
                    into granulated sugar. In the original Jackson mill, sugar 
                    cane juice was reduced to a granular form in a &quot;train 
                    of kettles,&quot; a series of large to small kettles heated 
                    by a fire under the smallest kettle. The heat from the fire 
                    was pulled through the flue, under the series of kettles, 
                    by the draft of a flue chimney. Excavators identified the 
                    opening of the flue chimney and the flue chimney foundation 
                    at the Lake Jackson mill, along with the circular brick remains 
                    of the kettle settings. </p>
                  <p class="text">When the sugar began to crystallize in the smallest, 
                    hottest kettle, the thick syrup was removed to cooling trays 
                    where the <b>crystallization process</b> continued. When the 
                    sugar cooled, it was placed in hogsheads, storage barrels, 
                    where the remaining molasses, uncrystallized syrup, was allowed 
                    to drain out of the hogsheads. The room where this separation 
                    occurred was called the purgery. Each hogshead contained about 
                    a thousand pounds of sugar. About three barrels of molasses 
                    were drained from each hogshead. The molasses was shipped 
                    to the Caribbean to be made into rum. </p>
                  <h3><a name="4"></a>Post Civil-War Sugar Production </h3>
                  <p class="text">An inventory of property at Lake Jackson Plantation 
                    in 1878 documents the change from fire to heat the sugar kettles 
                    to the use of steam as a heat source. By this time, the Jackson 
                    family no longer owned the plantation. The new owners completely 
                    converted the mill to adapt to steam power to heat the kettles. 
                    The kettles were stripped of their foundations, steam coils 
                    were wrapped abound the kettles to provide a more regulated 
                    heat and the kettle foundations were rebuilt. </p>
                  <p class="text">In addition to the changes in sugar making technology, 
                    a major change was made in the labor force at the mill: convicts 
                    replaced the slaves. After the Civil War, the state of Texas 
                    rented out their convicts as a labor supply. </p>
                  <p class="text">Differences in workmanship between the Jackson 
                    period construction and convict labor period became increasingly 
                    apparent during excavations. During the Jackson period, bricks 
                    made by the slaves were uniform in size, clay was high quality, 
                    and firing was regular. Only whole bricks were used, and walls 
                    were constructed with exceptional craftsmanship. In contrast, 
                    convicts were poor masons and used low-quality materials. 
                    They used bricks of different sizes, including fragmentary 
                    pieces, in their construction and applied mortar irregularly. 
                    Walls and foundations tended to slope and buckle over time. 
                    Other evidence helped archeologists distinguish construction 
                    of the two periods. For example, alterations made by convict 
                    labor after 1873 include:</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Blocked Passageways:</b> A blocked doorway 
                    was found in the wall separating the kettle area from the 
                    purgery. The east side of the wall shows an enclosed portal 
                    with plastered walls, while the west side has very sloppy, 
                    and uneven rows of bricks with &quot;bleeding&quot; mortar. 
                    The door between the crusher foundations and the kettle area 
                    was also closed with a brick wall.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Raised Walls:</b> The east/west wall, the 
                    south wall of the Jackson kettle enclosure, is an excellent 
                    example of a raised wall. Attached to the Jackson wall, iron 
                    masonry braces were placed about every four or five feet and 
                    a new section of wall was added. This alteration may be a 
                    result of the change from fire heat (train of kettles) to 
                    steam heat (steam train). The upper portion of the train of 
                    kettles would have been removed to expose the sides of the 
                    kettles. After steam coils were wrapped around the kettles, 
                    then the kettle area would have been sealed to enclose the 
                    kettles and contain the heat. This would explain convict walls 
                    on top of plantation walls in the kettle area.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Raised Floors:</b> The lower Jackson floor 
                    is like the Jackson foundation and walls in construction; 
                    substantial, level, and with excellent masonry. The lime pit 
                    and original Jackson floor found in 1994 became the cornerstone 
                    for all other Jackson floor identifications. The upper or 
                    raised convict floors are uneven. When the floor is of brick, 
                    it is one brick thick and of poor masonry construction. Convict 
                    period floors are also of dirt and had between 1 - 1.25 feet 
                    of fill between the Jackson floor and the convict floor.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Blocked Chimney:</b> The flue chimney opening 
                    was closed by bricks and was separated from the kettle area 
                    by a brick wall during the Convict Period alterations.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Firebox removed:</b> The brick foundation 
                    and grates of the firebox were removed and the opening to 
                    the firebox on the north wall was closed with a brick wall. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1995, more of the original Jackson plantation floor was 
                    uncovered along with a kettle setting and a heat flue in the 
                    middle of the sugar mill. Since 1995, the other original kettle 
                    settings have been located and the boiler and engine platforms 
                    of the Convict period have been identified. </p>
                  <h3><a name="5"></a>Putting the Pieces Together </h3>
                  <p class="text">Excavations revealed the components of the original 
                    Jackson mill: the horse treadmill that supplied the original 
                    power; the foundation for the cane crushers; the original 
                    train of kettles with fire box, kettle settings and flue chimney; 
                    and the purgery and storage area. By comparing the Lake Jackson 
                    mill to Osceola, Varner-Hogg and Bynum, it was learned that 
                    these four mills in Brazoria County were very similar in design 
                    and layout&#151;reflecting a shared process. Historic records 
                    state that the mills at Retrieve and Darrington&#151;Jackson's 
                    other plantations&#151;had double rows of kettles, called 
                    a double train. These two plantations are now state prisons.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although historic records document the addition 
                    of steam power to operate the cane crushers, the boiler and 
                    boiler chimney were not located during excavations. The foundation 
                    for the cane crushers probably remained the same. The change 
                    was from wooden to metal rollers to crush the cane. The heavier 
                    weight of the metal rollers may have required a more substantial 
                    foundation and the original foundation may have been augmented. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">After the Civil War, the mill was significantly 
                    altered in the transition to the &quot;steam train&quot; method. 
                    The cane crushing area is the only portion of the mill that 
                    not altered by the change. Addtionally, in the area between 
                    the large foundations of the crushers and the kettle area, 
                    the floor was raised with rubble about 1.5 feet above the 
                    Jackson floor. A single brick thick floor was laid on the 
                    rubble that contained a hole and drain. The train of kettles 
                    was torn apart, the firebox was removed, and the top portion 
                    of the kettle supports was removed to expose the kettles. 
                    The kettles were wrapped with steam coils of metal that were 
                    connected to the newly installed boilers. The kettle supports 
                    were then rebuilt resulting in convict construction on top 
                    of Jackson construction. Metal rods supported the new construction. 
                    The area around the open kettles would have been sealed to 
                    keep heat from escaping from below the kettles.</p>
                  <p class="text">Since fire was no longer a source of heat, the 
                    flue chimney was bricked closed and a wall built separating 
                    the chimney from the mill; the area became a trash dump. A 
                    new foundation for the new boilers was constructed north of 
                    the mill, close to the location of the kettles. </p>
                  <p class="text">What was the purpose in changing to steam heat? 
                    According to George Olcott, who studied the sugar making process 
                    during the mid-nineteenth century, &quot;Steam does not discolor 
                    the sugar nearly so much as fire, therefore steam trains have 
                    been extensively adopted, and great expense has frequently 
                    been incurred in altering the arrangement of the boiling-house 
                    to suit the new <em>regime</em>. A steam train will cost twice 
                    as much to run and keep in order as a common train will, to 
                    say nothing of the first expense&#133;&quot; Many mill operators 
                    claimed the heating of the kettles was easier to control but 
                    workers had to be highly trained to make the process work.</p>
                  <p class="text">Because so many Texas sugar mills have been 
                    completely destroyed or are in ruins, and because the historical 
                    record is incomplete, we do not know how many sugar mills 
                    changed to the steam train method. The Lake Jackson mill may 
                    be the only mill in Texas with preserved evidenced of this 
                    technology.</p>
