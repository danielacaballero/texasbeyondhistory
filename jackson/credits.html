          <p class="text">The Lake Jackson Plantation exhibit was written by <strong>Joan 
            Few</strong> and TBH Co-Editor <strong>Susan Dial</strong> and adapted in part from the 1999 
            <em>Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society</em> reports of the 
            TAS Lake Jackson Field Schools. <strong>Johnney Pollan</strong>, local arrangements 
            coordinator for both field schools, provided text for the TAS field 
            school section. </p>
            <p class="text"> Few has been an adjunct professor of anthropology/archeology 
              at the University of Houston at Clear Lake since 1991. With an undergraduate 
              degree in history and Master's in anthropology and archeology, Few 
              believes she has found the perfect blend. &quot;Words were never 
              enough for me,&quot; she explains. &quot;I have always felt that 
              history had to be embellished and substantiated by material evidence.&quot; 
              A Registered Professional Archeologist, Few has specialized chiefly 
              in sugar and cotton plantation archaeology and is the author of <em>Sugar, Planters, Slaves, and Convicts</em>, detailing her work at the plantation. She is a past president 
              of the TAS. <br>

            <p class="text">San Antonio native Johnney Pollan holds a BS Degree 
              in Engineering Science and has worked for the Dow Chemical Company 
              for more than 31 years. His interest in archeology began as a youth 
              when his cousin, famed San Antonio potter Harding Black, would tell 
              stories of the Witte Museum&#146;s digs in the lower Pecos River 
              in the late 1930&#146;s. A member of TAS since 1981, Pollan is a 
              charter member of the Southern Texas Archeological Association and 
              co-founder of the Brazosport Archaeological Society. At present 
              he is State Archeological Steward for Brazoria County. </p>

              Norman Flaigg, Sue Turner, and Dr. E. Mott Davis.</p>
