Based on archeological evidence, these fish were a favored catch in prehistoric times, just as today.  The two rayfish species are related, although the black drum is much larger than his redfish counterpart.  While a mature redfish weighs 6 to 8 pounds, a mature black drum weighs upwards of 5 to 30 pounds.   Photo by Steve Black.</span></div><p><a href="fish.html">X Back</a></p></body></html>
