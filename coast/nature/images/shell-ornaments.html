	  <h3>Marine Shell Ornaments, Icons and Offerings      </h3>
	  <p>Along the Texas coast marine and freshwater shell were used  prehistorically as body adornment, as status icons, and for burial with the  dead.&nbsp; These ritual usages were not  necessarily restricted to coastal life-ways, however.&nbsp; Archaeologists have found artifacts of prized  mollusks from the Gulf of Mexico far inland in a variety of contexts&#8212;from  large Archaic period cemeteries located many miles from the shore, to dry caves  in Mexico.&nbsp; As a desirable trade items,  shells were traded along routes that stretched as far north as Canada, or south  to Mesoamerica.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The habit of wearing seashells, but also burying them  with the dead (and therefore restricting the supply of them) has a long history  in Texas and elsewhere, spanning thousands of years and many different  cultures.&nbsp; This pervasive pattern  suggests that marine shells, as well as those of freshwater mussels, were not  only coveted for their beauty, but also imbued with economic and spiritual  significance. Shells symbolize water, creation, fertility, death and rebirth, and  their use in ritual contexts was a fairly universal occurrence, especially as part  of mortuary customs.&nbsp; Early inhabitants  of the New World may have believed that placement of shell with the dead would  allow the deceased access into the spirit world. </p>
      <p>Three species of shells found along the Texas coast were commonly  fashioned into jewelry or ritual accessories, and traded widely in prehistoric  times: Lightning Whelk (<em>Busycon Perversum</em>),  Lettered Olive (<em>Oliva sayana</em>) and  Minute Dwarf Olive (<em>Olivella minuta</em>).&nbsp; Larger gastropod species like Florida Horse  Conch (<em>Pleuroploca gigantia</em>) and the  True Tulip Shell (<em>Fasciolaria tulipa</em>),  as well as other cone and bivalve species, were also utilized, but not as  extensively. The most diverse range of shell species used to make artifacts  occurs n the Rio Grande delta area at the southern tip of Texas and  northeastern Tamaulipas. Although much less common than marine shell,&nbsp; delicate freshwater mussel shells, from river  and estuarine environments, were fashioned locally all along the Texas coast  into decorative items frequently found with burials.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        From these shell types came an array of ornamental and  ritual pieces, some remarkably beautiful:&nbsp;  pendants, gorgets, earrings, hair ornaments, beads for necklaces and  bracelets, &ldquo;tinklers&rdquo;, musical parts, clothing accessories, and engraved shell  cups associated with grave offerings.</p>
      <p><strong>Whelk Pendants and  Gorgets:</strong>&nbsp; The lightening whelk ranges  in size from 6-12 inches in length, and is sinistrally spiraled (to the left).  An assortment of pendant and gorget forms, made from the shell&rsquo;s detached and  edge-ground whorls, were often pierced for suspension, or sewn onto  clothing.&nbsp; Those found in graves were usually  positioned near the neck or chest of the interred individual, presumably hung  by some sort of natural fiber.&nbsp; Pendants  manufactured from whorl segments that include portions of the anterior canal  and penultimate suture can be quite large and elongated, incorporating traces of  the natural sinistral spiral.&nbsp; Smaller pendant types vary in shape  and size but are sub-rectangular or sub-triangular with occasional incised  surface decoration or punctuations, and multiple, biconical perforations  drilled along the long axis or apex of the piece.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	  <p>The term &ldquo;gorget&rdquo; is often used to describe large shell  artifacts worn as chest pieces.&nbsp; Gorgets  have been found in prehistoric contexts throughout the U.S. Southeast and  Midwest and differ somewhat from pendants in shape and decorative  elements.&nbsp; They are circular or slightly  ovoid, frequently engraved on their concave surfaces, and usually have paired  suspension holes along one edge.&nbsp; Such  artifacts have been found as grave offerings at Caddo sites in northeast Texas  and adjacent sites. They are made from the whorls of <em>Busycon</em> or other robust gastropods from the Gulf of Mexico. Some of  the raw materials used to make gorgets may well have been obtained along the  Texas coast, </p>
      <p><strong>Whelk and &ldquo;Conch&rdquo;  Shell Beads:</strong>&nbsp; Shell beads were cut  from the central columella portion of <em>Busycon  perversum</em> (or sometimes from the whorl). In the archeological literature  beads are commonly termed &ldquo;conch&rdquo; beads, a term that encompasses other  gastropods as well including the true conch of the genus <em>Strombus</em><em>, although the true conch  is rarely found along the Texas coast</em><em>.</em></p>
      <p>Disc beads are defined as having a wider diameter than  length; the opposite defines cylindrical beads whose lengths are longer than  the diameters. It is not unusual to find multiple sets of shell beads strung  together as necklaces and bracelets, or sewn onto clothing.&nbsp; Heavy cylindrical types exhibiting the spiral  grooves are most frequently associated with Late Archaic deposits, while the  smaller, finely ground cylinders and square shaped disc beads are typically  found in Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric contexts. </p>
      <p>A distinct chronological difference in columella bead form,  degree of grinding, and changes in bore technology can be seen among the grave  goods the <a href="../../../mitchell/index.html" target="_blank">Mitchell Ridge</a> site on  Galveston Island.&nbsp; The columella beads  found in early graves (initial Late Prehistoric, ca. AD. 700-1200) are  thick-walled, with deep, spiraling grooves indicating a lack of grinding along  the long axis.&nbsp; The bore-holes are  drilled biconically with a narrowing of the bore channel towards the middle.  Over time columella beads become more varied and narrower with thin walls,  ground surfaces, and straight bores.&nbsp; By  the Protohistoric period (16th and 17th centuries), columella beads  were more narrow, short and discoidal-like with a fair degree of grinding on  their surfaces.&nbsp; Many have bore-holes  drilled from one direction, creating a funnel-like bore channel towards a  smaller non-beveled hole on the opposite end. Lathe-turned cylindrical beads made  by Euro-American traders were found in several of the 18th century  graves at Mitchell Ridge; these have straight bores, no spiral grooves, and  were strung with glass beads. </p>
      <p><strong>Columella Bead  Technology:</strong>&nbsp; After detaching the  whorl from the columella (via breaking, percussion, cutting, or groove and snap  techniques), cylindrical beads were cut or sawn using an abrading tool into the  desired lengths.&nbsp; To make shell beads  (and other ornaments and tools) workers used stone tools including flint  flakes, thin side scrapers, chisel-like gravers, and sandstone abraders. Columella  beads, abraded to a point where the segments were easily snapped off, were then  shaped, drilled, ground, and polished.&nbsp;  The drilling process commonly involved the use of hafted chert drills to  bore either end of the cylindrical bead.&nbsp;  In the Rio Grande delta region, a variety of hammerstones, sandstone  cutters, used flakes and bifaces, and stone and bone drills have been found at  shell ornament manufacturing&nbsp; locales. </p>
      <p><strong>Olive Shell Beads and  &ldquo;Tinklers&rdquo;:</strong>&nbsp; Whole olive shells (<em>Oliva sayana </em>and<em> Olivella minuta</em>) provided a handy source for easy-to-assemble  beads.&nbsp; Found along the length of the  Texas shore, they were pierced and strung together, or sewn into clothing once  their spires were lopped off.&nbsp; Most oliva  and olivella beads exhibit little workmanship except for removal of the spire  above the shoulder.&nbsp; The smaller <em>Olivella minuta</em> are fairly thin, so  removal of the spire by light grinding or rubbing on a stone was all that was necessary  before being strung together&mdash;and more expedient than cutting.&nbsp; The larger <em>Oliva sayana</em> have thicker shells and required cutting and abrading.  Strands of spire-lopped oliva and olivella have  been found associated with burials at Mitchell Ridge, Galveston Island. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>Oliva Sayana</em> were  also used to make &ldquo;tinklers,&rdquo; small ornaments with suspension holes. Commonly,  the spire has been cut off just below the shoulder with holes drilled or cut in  the body, usually near the anterior canal.&nbsp;  A horizontal cut perpendicular to the long axis of the shell is sometimes  seen.&nbsp; In burial features in the Rio  Grande Delta, tinklers have been found nestled with perforated canine teeth,  presumably to achieve a clapper effect when suspended.&nbsp; Burying the dead with tinklers is widespread,  especially in Central America where tinklers are associated with burials,  caches, and midden deposits.&nbsp; Some have  been found carved in the shape of a human face or &ldquo;death&rsquo;s head&rdquo;.&nbsp; In Texas, the occurrence of&rdquo; tinklers&rdquo; from  archaeological deposits is not as common, but their presence signifies a  technological link or shared ideology with regard to very specific treatment of  the shell.&nbsp; The importance and  ritualistic use of olive shell &rdquo;tinklers&rdquo; in Texas is probably related to  Circum-Caribbean and Mesoamerican practices where similar artifacts are known.</p>

      <p><strong>Other Shell Beads,  Ornaments, and Offerings:&nbsp; </strong>Various  other shells such as sunray venus (<em>Macrocallista  nimbosa</em>), quahog (<em>Mercenaria sp</em>),  giant Atlantic cockle (<em>Dinocardium  robustum</em>), and ark (Anadara sp) sometimes were broken and fashioned into  beads and bead blanks.&nbsp; Smaller valves with  naturally occurring perforations were most likely picked up and used with no  other modification.</p>
      <p>Spire-lopped Atlantic Marginella (<em>Marginella Prunum</em>) strung as necklace are sometimes mistaken in the  archaeological literature for olivella.&nbsp;  They are about the same size but the marginella is broader across the  shoulder with a short spire and longer aperture.&nbsp; Its range in the Western Gulf is from Port  Aransas to the Yucatan and is commonly found in archaeological contexts,  especially in south Texas and Mesoamerica. The famed burial cave Cueva  Candelaria in northern Mexico yielded elaborate clusters of shell beads bound  together in fiber coils in what have been called <em>flores (</em>flowers). These ritual objects have marginella  shells or&nbsp; discoidal shell beads of  Busycon attached to them.</p>
      <p>At two sites along the lower Guadalupe River, Morhiss Mound  and the Linn Lake site, small caches of five or six purposefully stacked giant  Atlantic cockles have been found. This may represent ritual offerings, although  they could also have been cached for future use as raw materials for the  manufacture of ornaments or shells.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Freshwater and estuarine mussel shells were also used for  both decorative and functional purposes. Mussel shell scraping tools are a  fairly common trait for both south coastal Texas and the Tamualipas region of  Mexico, and highly decorative pendants or earrings, some with serrated edges  and perforations, have been found throughout Texas.&nbsp; At inland sites, away from the coast, access  to pearly river mussel provided the raw material needed for body decoration and  burial ritual.</p>
