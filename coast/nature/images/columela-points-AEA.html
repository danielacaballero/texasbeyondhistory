    <span class="caption"> Large numbers of columela points have been found in the Rio Grande delta in northeastern Tamaulipas.  These very carefully shaped and polished artifacts typically have a sharp distal tip and a squared-off and thinned proximal end to facilitate hafting.  Although they are assumed to represent arrow points, the larger ones weigh 6-12 grams, heavier than the 5 gram threshold said to be the dividing line between dart and arrow points.  In fact, we do not know how they were hafted and these may represent prongs from fishing spears or other weapons. A.E. Anderson Collection, TARL.</span>
