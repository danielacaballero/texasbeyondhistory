	  <h3>Marine Shell Tools  </h3>
	  <p>Along the Texas coast where access to raw materials for  stone working was relatively scare, enterprising aboriginals made tools out of  the toughest material at hand&mdash;marine shell.&nbsp;  Implements manufactured from shell were used for a wide variety of  kitchen tasks, animal and plant processing, and woodworking.&nbsp; The more durable species of whelk and sturdy  clam shells were adaptable to precise modification while others, may have been  picked up, sharpened, and used on the spot for expedient cutting and scraping  tasks and then discarded.</p>
      <p>Lightning whelk (<em>Busycon  perversum</em>), common rangia (<em>Rangia cuneata</em>),  sunray venus (<em>Macrocallista nimbosa</em>),  and oyster (<em>Crassostrea virginica</em>) were  the species most commonly worked.&nbsp; These,  and occasionally a few other species of bivalves and gastropods, were fashioned  into many essential tools:&nbsp; scrapers,  knives, projectile points, net weights, gouges, adzes, hoes, vessels, scoops,  containers, fish hooks, barbs, and weaving tools. The use of marine shells  along the Texas coast is part of a much broader widespread pattern along the  shores of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. </p>
      <p>In Texas the geographic range of different species plays a  role in the types of tools found in archaeological contexts.&nbsp; For example, in the warmer waters of south  Texas, sunray venus bivalves and the robust whelk columella tools (made from  the sturdy, central column after the outer whorl has been removed) are more prevalent  than on the Upper Texas coast.&nbsp; In  general, there is a north-south gradient of increasing salinity along the Texas  coast, due to dryer climate to the south which results in less freshwater  inflows into coastal bay/estuarine systems.&nbsp;  Because of this, low to moderate salinity oysters predominate to the  north, while higher salinity bivalves and gastropods are more abundant toward  Corpus Christi Bay. In the central and upper coast, rangia are found clustered  in dense beds in the brackish water of the marshland estuarine zones along the  lower stretches of rivers and streams entering bays. </p>
      <p><strong>Common Rangia:&nbsp; </strong>Alteration patterns seen on <em>Rangia cuneata</em> bivalves may be  attributable to direct or indirect human activity. Some valves may have been used  as is as expedient fish scalers, while others that show patterns of nicks,  notches and cut marks on their margins probably resulted from human shucking  activity, or simply from natural breakage in the shell midden.&nbsp; Because these brackish-water clams were major  food resources and most easily opened by briefly heating them in small fires  (hearths), many rangia shells have been burned, which weakens the shell. Another  reason rangia are often found in relatively poor condition is because discarded  rangia shells are found in dense accumulations (shell middens) that were no  doubt tromped on and deteriorated as the exposed shell deposits weathered.</p>
      <p>Thus it is not surprising that patterns of natural and  intentional modification are sometimes hard to distinguish. This is especially  true for perforated valves because the holes can result from either natural  predation, or from human alteration. Of the perforated rangia found at the  Guadalupe Bay site on the central coast, only the larger sized valves had holes  consistently located on the upper posterior portion of the shell body. Whether  or not the holes were intentionally or naturally drilled may not really matter  because these perforations provided fisherman or hunters an easy way to use the  shells for net weights or bolo weight.&nbsp;  Also, the holes allowed the bivalves to be tied together with cordage  for a variety of functional and ritual uses. </p>
      <p><strong>Oyster:&nbsp; </strong>The <em>Crassostrea  virginica</em> species of oyster inhabits bays and estuaries along North America&rsquo;s  eastern seaboard, the Gulf states, Mexico, and the West Indies. Oyster tools  have been found primarily in middens along the shores and barrier islands in  the upper and central Texas coast, but are less frequently reported for the  lower coast. Harvested primarily as a food source, the shell was only secondarily  put to functional tasks. Naturally robust, oyster shell would have held up well  to casual modification.&nbsp; Cabeza de Vaca  may have offered oyster tools as trade items on his inland journeys as a trader. </p>
      <p>Oyster shells were used as knives, scrapers, net weighs,  awls, or possibly as hafted digging tools.&nbsp;  Used in such ways, they exhibit a combination of notches, nicks and cut  edges along one or more margins. Man-made alterations differ from naturally  abraded oyster shells, which tend to exhibit smoothing over the entire valve surface.&nbsp; </p>

	  <p>Oyster valves with perforations may have been employed as  net weights, fishing sinkers, or as hafted implements for tending and  harvesting edible plants. Larger holes in the shell body that were drilled (or pecked)  from both directions were most likely modified by humans.&nbsp; Smaller holes drilled from one direction with  remarkably symmetrical diameters may have been bored by encrusting ectoprocts,  marine sponges (<em>C. celata</em>), algaes,  and/or other predators.&nbsp; It is  interesting to note that most of these holes are positioned in the left oyster  valves, which were presumably invaded while the living oyster was attached to  substrate (left valve is attached to substrate; right valve is smaller and lid-like).&nbsp; Perhaps naturally perforated oyster valves  were collected specifically for tool use; the holes were then subsequently  enlarged to accommodate hafting or cordage, or became broken out and irregular  as a result of usage.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p><strong>Sunray Venus:&nbsp; </strong><em>Macrocallista  nimbosa</em> shell is tough enough to be flaked using flintknapping techniques,  making it an especially desirable stone substitute in a lithic-poor area.  Bivalve tools with heavy nicks, crushing, and retouch to the shell edge were  used as knives or to scale fish, while the more robust valves served as anvils,  choppers, scrapers for skin processing, and weights for weirs or other fishing  gear.&nbsp; In extreme south Texas in the Rio  Grande Delta region, sunray venus scraping tools are very common, and in some  cases comprise the largest single artifact class found in surveys of the area. </p>
	  <p>Sunray Venus clam shells, formed into blades or triangular  shaped projectile points, have been found at sites in the vicinity of Corpus  Christi Bay and Baffin Bay. &nbsp;At site 41SP78 in San Patricio County on Redfish Bay, whole valves with abraded ventral margins were  recovered stacked together within burials, presumably after being used to dig  the grave.&nbsp; Such a custom is reminiscent  of the placement of stacked, unmodified bivalves, interpreted to be food  offerings, in early graves at Mitchell Ridge on the upper Texas coast.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p><strong>Lightning  Whelk:&nbsp; </strong>The  most useful marine shell of all was the gastropod <em>Busycon perversum,</em> the largest, most complexly  structured, and densest shell.&nbsp; Tools  were fashioned from either the detached outer whorl or the columella (central  column) section of the shell.&nbsp; In some  cases, portions of the entire shell are used, such as for containers, bowls, or  drinking vessel. </p>
	  <p>Columella tools include hammers, picks, gouges, chisels, perforators,  awls and projectile points.&nbsp; In most  cases the columella and spire are completely removed from the whorl body.&nbsp; Hammers appear worn on both ends, and are  grasped in the middle, while gouges, or chisels, have one steeply beveled edge  at the anterior or canal end.&nbsp; Whelk  columella adzes occur at some inland sites, such as <a href="../../../morhiss/evidence.html" target="_blank">Morhiss Mound</a>   where they are found along with the stone adze form known as the Guadalupe  tool.</p>

Note that the ridge has been partially ground, probably to facilitate hafting. The scooped or spoon-shaped cross-section reflects the natural character of the shell. Lateral edges exhibit some chipping and smoothing, probably also to facilitate hafting of the adze. Also note the very well-shaped cutting edge characteristic of this adze type.

      <p>In general, small whelk columellas were used as perforators,  awls or maybe as hairpins.&nbsp; One end was  ground to a sharp point (in some cases, bi-pointed implements were fashioned)  while the remainder of the columella was left unaltered.&nbsp; Because they exhibit no grinding marks,  several researchers have suggested that these items may have been natural  fragments smoothed by weathering or wave action on a sloping beach.&nbsp; Naturally formed or not, these pointed  cylindrical artifacts have been found in many sites in the coastal plains,  showing that they were transported from the beaches to their living areas by  local inhabitants.</p>
      <p>Exquisite projectile points were fashioned from large whelk  columella, either of <em>Busycon</em> or the  giant horse conch<em> Pleuroploca gigantia</em>.&nbsp; Although these are found in small numbers in  the central coast, they are very common in the lower coast in the Rio Grande  delta area. They were abraded and polished forming a lanceolate, bullet-shaped  point with tapered and slightly convex or squared-off base.&nbsp; There is very little data on the hafting of  these points but they are usually found in Late Prehistoric contexts and appear  to represent arrow tips or perhaps the prongs of small fishing spears.</p>
      <p>Shell tools, fashioned from the outer whorl segments of  gastropods, have a large distribution range in Texas.&nbsp; Described as adzes or gouges in the  literature they have two basic shapes, rectangular or triangular.&nbsp; These forms have smooth lateral edges with ground  bits at the anterior or posterior end of the shell.&nbsp; The cutting edge or bit is usually ground on  the concave face of the shell with an average angle of about 50 degrees.&nbsp; These kinds of whorl tools are thought to  have been used in woodworking and/or animal skin processing (i.e., hide  scraping).</p>
