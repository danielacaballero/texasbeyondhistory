The impending storm apparently trigged frenzied animal behavior, bringing to mind Cabeza de Vaca&apos;s account of witnessing (and likely participating in) group &ldquo;hunts&rdquo; to drive deer into bays and cause them to drown.  Deer only run against the wind as to outrun the smell of an ensuing predator.  Since the wind on the Texas coast often blows inland from the South, the coastal natives were often aided by Mother Nature in deer hunting strategies.
