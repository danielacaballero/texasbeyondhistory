    <span class="caption"> This style of shell adze is the most common of the three types of shell adzes recovered from midden deposits at Morhiss Mound. It is manufactured from a rectangular section of exterior whorl from a conch shell. The proximal or bottom edge of this adze exhibits a portion of the ornamental ridge where the exterior whorl and the shoulder of the spire meet. Note that the ridge has been partially ground, probably to facilitate hafting. The scooped or spoon-shaped cross-section reflects the natural character of the shell. Lateral edges exhibit some chipping and smoothing, probably also to facilitate hafting of the adze. Also note the very well-shaped cutting edge characteristic of this adze type. The general morphological similarity of this shell adze type to Clear Fork tools may suggest a similar range of functions, primarily as woodworking tools.</span>
