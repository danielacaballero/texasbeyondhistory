<h1>Netleaf Hackberry (Celtis laevigata Willd.)</h1>
<p>Sugar Berry&nbsp;(<em>Celtis reticulata</em> Torr.) Granje&ntilde;o/Desert Hackberry (<em>Celtis pallida </em>Torr.) Ulmaceae (Elm Family) </p>
<p>Three species of hackberry grow on the Texas coast. Netleaf hackberry and  sugarberry grow primarily along streams and swales.&nbsp; The third species, granje&ntilde;o (desert  hackberry), grows on uplands such as clay dunes or on prairie margins.</p> 

	<p>Both sugarberry and netleaf hackberry produce an edible  fruit and strong, flexible wood that were utilized by the native populations. Each tree  produces a slightly different fruit. The desert hackberry fruit is a small,  fleshy drupe with a crunchy, hollow, calcareous stone (seed). They are bright  orange, juicy, and tart, if you don't mind the crunchy center. Both netleaf  hackberry and sugarberry produce a reddish-to-black fruit with a smaller, mealy  flesh wrapped around a calcareous stone that is not hollow and much harder than  granje&ntilde;o.&nbsp; The Plains Apache name for  sugarberry, for example, translates &ldquo;hard seed&rdquo; (Jordan 2008). The sugarberry  fruit is somewhat sweeter and fleshier than that of netleaf hackberry. </p>
	<p><strong>Archeology. </strong>Because hackberry seeds are calcareous, they are often  preserved in soils.&nbsp; It is often  difficult to tell if hackberry seeds from archeological sites are relatively  recent and part of the natural seed rain or are prehistoric in origin and were  brought in by native peoples. </p>
	<p>Because few coastal excavations have been conducted and  preservation is poor I am not aware of any reliable records of hackberry from  coastal sites. A single occurrence of possible hackberry seed in the deposits  of the Hinojosa site, a Late Prehistoric Toyah Phase site in Jim Wells County,  is the best direct evidence we have for eating this fruit in a site near the  coast (Black 1986), but this is about 70 km from the coast. However, with the  accelerating pace of excavation and analysis and the widespread use of  flotation recovery methods hackberry is bound to turn up in archeological sites  from the region.</p>
	<p>Discoveries from archeological sites in other regions as  well as in human coprolites (dried feces) confirm a long history of human use.  Desert hackberry seeds were recovered by the thousands from Hinds Cave  in southwest Texas, and are clearly visible in  dozens of rockshelter sites in the Lower Pecos  (Dering 1979; 2008; Irving 1966). A single hackberry seed was noted in the  limited plant collections made from the Kyle Shelter, a Late Prehistoric Toyah  Phase site (Jelks 1962). Hackberry seeds were recovered from the Vargas site on  the southwestern Edwards   Plateau (Quigg et al.  2005). </p>
	<p>Archeologists have identified hackberry wood in samples from  the Hinojosa site as well as two sites in Maverick  County near Eagle Pass (Black 1986; Dering 2005).</p>
	<p><strong>Food</strong>. Hackberry  fruits are rich in sugar and calcium. When pounded into a pulp, they can be  easily dried or mixed with other foods. Desert hackberry fruit is quite  nutritious, containing up to 20% crude protein, as well as phosphorous, and  calcium (Everitt and Alaniz 1981). </p>
	<p>I have not yet located specific ethnographic or  ethnohistorical references to the use of hackberry in Texas;  so all of the following references are from groups in Oklahoma,  northwestern Mexico and the  southwestern United States. </p>
	<p>Most of the uses for sugarberry or netleaf hackberry usually  involve some processing. Most of the groups using this fruit pounded it, which  infers the use of a mortar and pestle. They often mixed the resulting mush with  water or with other meats or plant foods such as parched corn. These groups include  the Comanche, Yavapai, Chiricahua or Mescalero Apache. </p>
	<p>The Plains Apache of southern Oklahoma valued the sugarberry and netleaf  hackberry fruit as a source of sweetness before the days of the Euro-American  introduced diet. They used the fruit to flavor dried meats, and as a snack  food. They would also pound the entire fruit and mix it with tallow or kidney  fat to make a confection (Jordan 2008). The Dakota used the fruit of <em>Celtis occidentalis</em> to flavor meats,  pounding them into a fine meal before mixing it with the meat (Gilmore  1977).&nbsp; Several other Plains Indians  living north of Texas,  including the Kiowa, and Pawnee processed another closely <em>Celtis occidentalis</em> in the same manner (Castetter and Opler 1936;  Gifford 1936; Gilmore 1977). The Comanche beat sugarberry fruit into a pulp,  rolled it into balls with some fat, and roasted the resulting mix over a fire  (Carlson et al. 1942). The Chiricahua and Mescalero and the Dakota dried the  fruit for future use (Castetter and Opler; Gilmore 1977). </p>
	<p>The Onavas Pima and the Seri consumed the fresh fruits of  desert hackberry (Felger and Moser 1991; Pennington 1980). There is no record  of processing desert hackberry fruits into a storable form, or including it in  other food preparations. The fruit usually ripens in late summer, early fall. </p>
	<p><strong>Other Uses</strong>. The  hard and flexible wood of desert hackberry wood was utilized for various  implements and in some cases as firewood. The Seri made cradle boards from the  wood. Hackberry wood was also favored for making bows (Felger and Moser 1991).  The Navajo boiled leaves and branches of netleaf hackberry to make a  reddish/brown dye for wool. The Tewa used hackberry wood for tool handles. The  Papago fashioned sandals from the bark of hackberries (Castetter and Underhill  1935; Elmore 1944; Robbins et al. 1916). The Plains Apache used sugarberry wood  for fuel, although its quality was questioned by one informant (Jordan 2008)</p>
