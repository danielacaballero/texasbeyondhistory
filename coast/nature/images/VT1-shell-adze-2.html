<span class="caption">The second most numerous shell adze type from the Morhiss site were manufactured from the interior columella obtained from large horse conch shells procured from the Texas Gulf coast. A columella section of suitable length was removed from the shell by either the groove and snap technique or direct percussion. The cutting edge or bit was shaped by grinding and the proximal end was roughly prepared by light smoothing or grinding. Note the general morphological similarity of this shell adze type to the Guadalupe biface or adze, again suggesting this form was primarily used as a woodworking tool. </span></div>
