Although this Paleoindian point is thought to have come from a now-submerged offshore site, Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts from upper coastal sites are often made of similar material.  Silicified wood was likely obtained from  river gravels as well as from more distant upland sources in southeastern Texas.
