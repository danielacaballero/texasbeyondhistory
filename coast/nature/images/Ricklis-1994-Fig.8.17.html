    <span class="caption"> Slender chert drill found in a Protohistoric grave (late 16th or early 17th century) at the Mitchell Ridge site along with 41 short tubular conch shell beads, such as the two shown here (in side view and silhouetted cross-section). As indicated by the dashed lines, the tip and lower edges of the drill are worn smooth from use. As can be seen, the diameter of the drill tip almost perfectly matches the interior diameter of the beads, which were all drilled mainly from one end. Adapted from Ricklis, 1994, Figure 8.17.</span>
