    <span class="caption">   Pendants and gorgets were made from the outer or penultimate body whorl of the lightning whelk terminology.  Once the artifact blank was formed by cutting and breaking off a suitable section of whorl, it was shaped and smoothed by grinding into the final form.  Some gorgets were elaborately shaped and incised, but the most common modification was simply to drill suspension holes. Adapted from Hall 1981, Figure 44.</span>
