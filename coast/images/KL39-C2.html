	<div class="caption"><em>Human bone &ldquo;tubes&rdquo; from the Pescador site on Cayo del Grullo.&nbsp; They were found on the surface of an eroded cemetery site, and doubtlessly represent grave goods.&nbsp; Perhaps some were strung as beads, but most are rather large for that purpose.&nbsp; The artifacts shown here were made from long bones including femur, tibia, fibula, and radius as well rib bones.&nbsp; They were fashioned by the cut and snap technique.&nbsp; One is decorated with a zig-zag pattern of incised lines highlighted by red ochre; on the opposite side are closely spaced parallel lines like those found on musical rasps.
