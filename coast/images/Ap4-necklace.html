<div class="caption">Mary Perkins, who brought the necklace to TARL, wrote: &ldquo;About 1913, my father-in-law was down on the Bolivar Peninsula with his Boy Scout Troop. There were piles of shell that apparently covered an Indian burial mound. He took home what appears to be made of bone, a large necklace, complete. It was strung on rotten leather of some kind, so the bones were reset on a nylon cord in the way they were on the leather. It is one of the most interesting things I have seen.&rdquo;</div>
