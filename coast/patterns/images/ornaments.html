	<strong>Ornaments</strong> 
<div class="text">
  <p>Prehistoric craftsmen fashioned a diverse range of ornaments from the varied and often exotic-looking marine shells abundantly available along the Texas coast. Opalescent oyster shells could be cut into discs and perforated to make flat beads.  Smaller, colorful Olive shells were drilled and strung on cords for use on necklaces and belts, or sewn separately on clothing as tinklers. Because of their large size, shells of lightning whelk (<em>Busycon perversum pulleyi</em>) and Florida horse conch (<em>Pleuroploca gigantea</em>) were prized for making ornaments and other items. The inner columella could be drilled at the top to form a long, vertical pendant.  Blanks cut from the outer whirl also could be made into perforated disc beads or gorgets.  Bird bones and turtle shell, as well as human bone, also were made into beads and ornaments. Shown here are a few examples of shell ornaments from coastal sites.
