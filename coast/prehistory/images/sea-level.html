      <p>The coastline as we see it today is, from a geologic perspective, a very recent phenomenon that dates back only about 3,000 years.  In fact, prior to around 8,000 B.C., the area of the modern shoreline was high and dry, with the Gulf coast far to the east of its present position.  This is because, in earlier millennia, global sea level was as much as 100 meters (over 300 feet) lower, with much of the world’s water supply “locked” in vast continental ice sheets and montane glaciers that were far more extensive than those of modern times.  This era, the Pleistocene (or, in common parlance, the “Ice Age”) had markedly lower global temperatures than those of historical times.  The final cold phase of the Pleistocene was around 20,000 years ago, after which rising global temperatures caused the continental ice sheets and mountain glaciers to begin a gradual melting process, with the result that sea level began to rise rapidly over the next 10,000 years.</p>
      <p>Below is a graphical portrayal of the five major stages in the development  of the modern Texas  coastal environment.&nbsp; Look it over and  then read the continued discussion after the last stage. </p></td>

    <td><p>As sea level rose rapidly at the end of the Pleistocene,  shorelines around the world moved progressively father inland.&nbsp; By 8,000 B.C. the sea had inundated major  river valleys along the Texas  coast.&nbsp; The flooding of the valleys of  major streams, such as the Trinity, Lavaca, Guadalupe, Aransas, and Nueces Rivers  created the earliest forms of our modern coastal bays (respectively, Galveston, Matagorda, San Antonio,  Copano, and Corpus Christi   Bays).&nbsp; The same presumably occurred at the mouths of  the Brazos and Rio Grande Rivers, but the heavy sediment loads (clay, silt and  sand) carried by these major rivers have since&nbsp;  filled in whatever early bays were created by sea level rise.</p>
      <p>After this time (10,000 years ago), sea level continued to  rise for another 7,000 years, but at a slower rate.&nbsp; Many geologists have suggested that rising  sea level was not gradual or continuous, but rather that it was intermittent,  with periods of rise interrupted by intervals of stable sea level.&nbsp; By around 3,000 years ago (1,000 B.C.), sea  level had reached its modern position and has since then been basically stable  (though probably with some minor fluctuations).&nbsp;  With sea level at a still stand, ongoing wave action and longshore drift  deposited sand and shell hash parallel to the mainland, forming the modern  chain of barrier islands:&nbsp; Padre,  Mustang, San Jose, and Matagorda  Islands along the Middle and Lower  Texas coast and Galveston Island and Bolivar  Peninsula along the Upper Texas   Coast. </p>
      <p>Archaeological research on the upper and middle portions of  the Texas  coast has shown that prehistoric human occupation of the shoreline varied  markedly in its intensity over that last 10,000 years, the geologic epoch known  as the Holocene.&nbsp; Based on the  information we have now, the first period of occupation by early people was  between ca. 8,200 and 6,800 years ago, after which occupation was relatively  sparse.&nbsp; Then there was a major period of  shoreline occupation between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago.&nbsp; This was again broken by a one-thousand-year  hiatus, during which evidence for occupation is very limited.&nbsp; Starting around 3,000 years ago, or ca. 1,000  B.C., there is again abundant evidence for major occupation, during which time  fishing became an increasingly important part of the subsistence economy of the  human inhabitants. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>Based on some of the geological estimates of the pattern of  sea level rise during the Holocene Epoch, it appears that the three major  periods of human occupation and resource extraction along the bay shores  corresponded with times of relatively stable sea level.&nbsp; This makes good sense from an ecological  perspective, since when sea level was at a still stand, ongoing sedimentation  of bay bottoms (as rivers dropped their sediment loads into the bays) created  extensive shoreline shallows that supported extensive salt marshes and grass  flats.&nbsp; The shallow water had high rates  of photosynthesis that, combined the high plant biomass from the marshes and  grass flats, produced the organic nutrients needed to sustain high aquatic  biomass.&nbsp; These estuaries supported a  rich food chain comprised of salt-tolerant plant communities, crustaceans,  mollusks and fish.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>These rich environments offered prehistoric hunting and  gathering peoples a secure subsistence base, which resulted in their  establishing camps along bay shores from which they could procure a rich  harvest of shellfish and fish.&nbsp; Such  encampments are in evidence today as the many archaeological shell middens that  dot the shores of the bays and lagoons of the Texas coast.</p>
      <p>In contrast, when sea level was rising more or less rapidly,  between 6,800-6,000 years and 4,000-3,000 years ago, the extensive shoreline  shallows became more deeply submerged, thus reducing photosynthesis and  depressing overall biotic productivity, with the result that the bayshores  became far less attractive to prehistoric people.&nbsp; Thus we see a marked reduction in  archaeological evidence for these periods along the bay shorelines during these  periods.</p>
    <p>The sea level and bay development patterns outlined here are  based on mounting archeological and geological evidence as interpreted by  author Robert Ricklis. &nbsp;As the timing of  sea level change and human occupation is fine tuned and better known, the  localized consequences of &ldquo;minor fluctuations&rdquo; may become clear.&nbsp; For example, some geologists have inferred  the existence of multiple periods of &ldquo;high stand&rdquo; when sea level appears to  have been several meters higher than modern levels. These relatively minor  fluctuations from the big picture perspectives may well have drastically impacted  the human exploitation of specific ecological niches along the coastal  zone.&nbsp; Lawrence Aten has argued for such  a scenario in the Taylor Bayou area on the uppermost Texas coast.
