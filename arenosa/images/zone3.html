      <h3>Zone 3: Early Late Archaic Period</h3>
      <p>Zone 3 at Arenosa dates to the early part of the Late Archaic  period,  which lasted from 1500 until 400 B.C. and corresponds to the Cibola subperiod defined by Dave Dibble. Zone 3 includes  strata 10 and 11, both of which contained cultural materials.</p>
	    <p>Bone tools (mainly awls) and beads are very common in the Zone  3 collections. Beads were most frequently made from the bones of jackrabbit, perhaps due to  the increased reliance on rabbit for food during this time. Antler tools are  much less common. Those that were recovered were likely used in the  flint-knapping process or to work wood or animal hide.</p>
	    <p>The dart point assemblage from Zone 3 is dominated by  Montell and Shumla points, but also includes some Val Verde, Langtry, Frio, and Marcos points. Some painted pebbles appeared in  both strata. Groundstone also appeared in both strata, but was much more  prevalent in Stratum 11.</p></td>

        <p>The people who camped at Arenosa during this time made their stone tools with the chert, limestone, quartzite, basalt, sandstone, agate, jasper, chalcedony, petrified wood, and unidentified igneous and metamorphic material from the river gravels along the Pecos and Rio Grande. They also sometimes collected chert from ancient deposits on the uplands or quarried it from Salmon Peak outcrops along the margins of the plateau.</p>
	    <p>Faunal preservation was particularly good at Arenosa, revealing much about the diets of the people who camped there. They hunted deer and antelope in both the uplands and canyons. Rodents were an important source of food, especially rabbits which were likely driven into nets, clubbed with throwing sticks, or snared. Many were skinned before being eaten. Along the rivers, they gathered freshwater mussels and hunted soft-shelled and snapping turtle, which they roasted in their shells. Using nets, weirs, or possibly even toxicants, they also took gar, catfish, large suckers, and drum from the rivers. These fish were then filleted, possibly so that the meat could be dried for storage and transport.</p>
