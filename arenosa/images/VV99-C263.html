      Feature 21 was a large large pit located near the sloping rear wall of the shelter, which can be seen at the top of the photo. It contained 10 grinding slabs (or fragments), charcoal, and various other items and may have functioned as a storage facility.  It was dug from the surface of Stratum 9, through Stratum 10, into Stratum 11 and is a particularly clear example of how prehistoric peoples sometimes disturbed the natural stratigraphy. <br><br>
            As can be seen, it would be hard (if not impossible) to tell whether the charcoal in the feature pit was introduced from older cultural layer into which the pit was dug into or whether it was charcoal created at the same time of the feature event. It is to be expected that not all such "mixing" events left as tell-tale stratigraphic evidence as did Feature 21.  ANRA-NPS Archives at TARL.
