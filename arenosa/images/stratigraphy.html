		<p>Arenosa is a deep and spectacularly well-stratified terrace  site with deposits that were at least 42 feet thick and contained 49 identifiable strata  (layers).  These strata were created by periodic  flooding of the Pecos River, as well as backflooding by the nearby Rio Grande River, that blanketed the site with sand  and mud. Each flood created a new surface on the floor of the rockshelter, and  prehistoric people lived on many of them. As they built hearths and discarded their  trash, the people of Arenosa covered the floor of the rockshelter with  charcoal, burned rock, mussel shell, animal bone, broken tools, and other  cultural materials. These &ldquo;cultural strata&rdquo; were eventually covered with more flood  deposits, creating a textbook example of ideal archeological and geologic  stratification. During excavation of the site, 32 radiocarbon assays were taken  from various strata, providing what archeologist Michael Collins has  characterized as &ldquo;the best single-site chronological record&rdquo; in the Amistad  region and &ldquo;one of the best in North America.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>Dave Dibble, who led the excavations at Arenosa, divided the  site&rsquo;s deposits into two groups&ndash;the lower deposits (strata 42-23a) and the  upper deposits (strata 23-1). Arenosa&rsquo;s lower deposits are the oldest strata  and exist only in the eastern part of the site, where they were protected from  erosion by a large roof spall dubbed &ldquo;Big Mother Rock.&rdquo; They consist of  relatively thin layers of burned rock, shell, and other cultural debris,  separated by broad layers of sterile sand. The oldest strata (42, 41, 40, and 39)  do not contain any cultural materials. Remains of extinct bison and other large  ungulates were identified in strata 42 and 40, but there is no direct evidence  of human butchering of the carcasses. The earliest unequivocal evidence of  human activity at Arenosa consists of 4 unifaces, several flakes, charcoal, and  snail and mussel shell recovered from stratum 38. Radiocarbon assays taken from  the charcoal date this occupation to 8990 B.C. (calibrated mid-point). Strata  37-23a consist of alternating layers of sterile flood deposits (37, 35, 33,  32a, 31, 29, 27, 26, 24, 23c, and 23a) and relatively thin cultural deposits (36,  34, 32, 30, 28, 25b, 25a, 23d, and 23b). Strata 32, 30, 28, 25, 23d, and 23b date  from approximately 4200 to 2600 B.C.</p>
		  
		   <p> Strata 23-1 are the site&rsquo;s &ldquo;upper deposits.&rdquo; They include  more cultural strata than the lower deposits, and these cultural strata are  generally thicker. As Arenosa&rsquo;s deposits grew ever taller, it became more  difficult for floods to inundate the site. This allowed people to occupy  Arenosa for longer periods of time in between floods, creating thicker cultural  strata. Strata 23-20 all contain cultural materials, but appeared to have been  seriously disturbed by running water. They date from about 2600 to 1500 B.C.  Stratum 19 is a thick sterile deposit of sand that covers strata 20 and 21. It  likely represents the fill of an old drainage channel that ran through Arenosa.  From the time that the channel was formed to the time that it was filled in  with sand, there appears to have been little or no human activity at the site. Strata  18-12 form a series of thin, discrete layers alternating between sterile flood  deposits (17, 15, 13, and 12) and cultural deposits (18, 16, and 14). These  strata represent a very brief period of time lasting only from about 700 to 600  B.C. Strata 10 and 9 are cultural strata that date from approximately 550 to 100  B.C. Above these layers are cultural strata 4, 5, and 7, and sterile stratum 8,  which date from about 100 B.C. to A.D. 500. The latest occupation of Arenosa is  represented by strata 2 and 3. They are capped by stratum 1&ndash;a sterile deposit  created by the 1954 flood that extends to the roof of the rockshelter.</p>
		  <p>In 1991, archeologist Solveig Turpin assigned Arenosa&rsquo;s  strata to archeological periods based on their radiocarbon assays and the types  of artifacts they contained. Strata 42-32 belong to the Late Paleoindian and Early  Archaic periods, strata 31-12 to the Middle Archaic period, strata 11 and 10 to  the Early Late Archaic period, strata 9-3 to the Terminal Late Archaic period,  stratum 2 to both the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods, and stratum 1 to  the Historic period. Using Turpin&rsquo;s assignments, we have divided Arenosa&rsquo;s  stratigraphy into 6 zones. Zone 6 is non-occupational and contains strata  42-39, Zone 5 contains strata 38-32, Zone 4 contains strata 31-12, Zone 3  contains strata 11 and 10, Zone 2 contains strata 9-3, and Zone 1 contains  strata 2 and 1.</p>
		  <p>Archeologist Christopher Jurgens thoroughly described each  of Arenosa&rsquo;s strata in his 2005 Ph.D. dissertation, based on Dave Dibble&rsquo;s original  field notes, Dibble 1997, and Collins 1974.
