          <p align="left">A total of 32 radiocarbon assays have been run on samples of  charcoal from Arenosa Shelter. On the right is a graphical depiction of the 32  Arenosa radiocarbon dates. As can be seen, all but one of the assays form an  almost unbroken span stretching from 4350 B.C. to A.D. 650. 
<p align="left">There is a very  large gap of several thousand years between the oldest assay and this span, as  well as five small gaps within the span representing hundreds of years with few  or no dates. This, of course, does not necessarily mean the site was unoccupied  by prehistoric peoples during these periods. These could simply be sampling  gaps as not all of the strata with cultural remains have dated. Nonetheless, the apparent gaps are roughly 8800-4400 B.C., 4100-3700 B.C.,  2300-2000 B.C., 1900-1700 B.C., 1500-1000 B.C., and A.D. 200-600.
<p align="left">Let us briefly consider what these &ldquo;dates&rdquo; really represent.  Radiocarbon assays are statistical estimates that yield approximate time range  estimates, not precise dates. They are reported in radiocarbon years before the  present (B.P. or RCYBP), corrected to account for known carbon fluctuation  values, and then calibrated by reference to much more precise tree-ring  chronologies. The calibrated values give an approximation of the estimated age  in conventional calendar years B.C./A.D. Calibration yields an estimated mid-point  within a statistical range often expressed as a &ldquo;2-sigma&rdquo; range, meaning that  the true age of the dated sample has a 95% chance of falling within the range.  In the accompanying graphic, the bars for each date depict the 2-sigma range,  a span usually covering several hundred years. Throughout the Arenosa exhibit  the cited dates are usually expressed as calibrated mid-points, out of  convenience and simplicity.</p>
      <p align="left">In practical terms, a single radiocarbon date does not give  researchers a great deal of confidence that the one date accurately represents  the &ldquo;targeted event&rdquo; &ndash; the activity that left behind the organic material  dated. There are various factors that can cause erroneous estimates such as  sample contamination, lab processing errors, and so on. That is why  archeologists try to obtain suites or sets of dates from several different  materials and different contexts (layers and excavation areas within sites) to  gain confidence and detect meaningful patterns in the use of a site through  time.</p>
      <p align="left">With these factors in mind, consider   the Arenosa radiocarbon record. In 1991, archeologist Solveig Turpin assigned  Arenosa&rsquo;s strata to archeological periods based on their radiocarbon assays and  the types of artifacts they contained. Using Turpin&rsquo;s assignments, we have  divided Arenosa&rsquo;s stratigraphy into 6 zones, 5 of which have evidence of human  occupation. Zone 1 contains the site&rsquo;s youngest cultural strata, while Zone 5  contains the oldest. The radiocarbon assays in the graphical depiction on the  right have been color-coded according to the zone they came from.</p>
      <p align="left">Though in general, the ages of the radiocarbon assays  conform to the projected ages of the zones, there are two &quot;outlier&quot; assays that appear much older than  the zones they came from. The oldest assay from Zone 4 has a 2-sigma range of  4360-4340 B.C. This makes it about 700 years older than the next oldest assay  from Zone 4, and older even than one of the assays from Zone 5. The other assay  in question comes from Zone 2, but has a 2-sigma range of 970-900 B.C. Not only  is it more than 500 years older than the next oldest assay from Zone 2, it is  older than all four assays from Zone 3. </p>
      <p align="left">Although the seemingly out-of-place ages of these  two assays may be the result of contamination of the dated charcoal, it seems more likely that the charcoal was &quot;out of place.&quot; Although the stratigraphy of Arenosa is outstanding, there are a variety of events which may well have resulted in older charcoal occurring in later deposits. For instance older charcoal from elsewhere could have been introduced to the site during flooding episodes. But a more likely explanation is that the people who lived at Arenosa inadvertently introduced older materials into younger deposits by digging pits for cooking features or other purposes. </p>
      <p align="left">Today, radiocarbon dating strategies for sites like Arenosa are much more sophisticated than they were in the 1960s and 1970s. The AMS radiocarbon dating method makes it possible to date tiny fragments of charcoal instead of the handful-sized samples that conventional radiocarbon methods require. As a consequence, archeologists can be much more choosey about what they date. We also routinely  identify the charred material before it is dated and measure  and make corrections for the carbon isotope (delta C13) value.</p>
      <p align="left"> We recognize today that a site like Arenosa would require many more assays from precise materials and contexts before it could be considered well dated. Fortunately, the Arenosa  collections contain many samples of charcoal and bone that future researchers could use to improve the radiocarbon record. </p>
