              that you think is really interesting, but taking it away from its
              home means that you're taking a piece of history. Once that home
              site is changed, it can't be put back together again. An artifact's
              position (where it's located) in a site gives important clues about
              its story. For instance, finding a sandal near some charred stones
              in a cave might tell you that the owner was preparing or eating
              dinner when he took his shoes off. If the shoe or stones were moved
              or stolen, the archeologist documenting the site may miss some important
              information about that person's life, like whether they had really
              huge feet! </span></p>

      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">What if I want

      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">It's better
        to let professional archeologists do that. A dig may involve both archeologists
        and trained volunteers working to carefully excavate a site. The whole
        area is studied, and detailed reports are made about the land and each
        artifact found. These reports help explain how the artifact was preserved
        over time, why it was left in that place, and what life was like at that
        time in that geographic area. Once an artifact is removed, moved or damaged,
        it can never be studied in the same way again. </span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="purple">Imagine that someone goes into your
        bedroom and, without asking, takes a few of your toys. Then they move
        your bed to a different wall, tear some pages from your books, and leave
        some of their belongings on the floor (if you have a little brother or
        sister, you probably know exactly how this feels). Without being able
        to ask you, it would be hard to know where things are supposed to go,
        what is missing, and which items don't belong to you. Unfortunately, when
        you study people that lived long ago, they are no longer around to help
        you understand their homes, their belongings, and their lives. Archeologists
        are trained to help tell the stories of the past. These stories are much
        harder to tell each time a clue is removed. Besides, everyone knows it's
        just as rude to steal from dead people as from live ones.</span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">Why should I
        even care about the past? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">Because the
        past helps us know where we came from and what the future will be like.
        We know some amazing facts about human history from archeological discoveries.
        For instance, we're sorry to break the news to you, but Michael Jordan
        did not invent basketball. In fact, the ancient Mayans were playing a
        somewhat similar ball game complete with rubber ball and stone hoop over
        a thousand years ago. We know this from discovering their ball courts!
        Every time you flush the toilet, you should say thank you to the people
        of the ancient Indus civilization along the Indus River in what is today
        Pakistan. They created one of the first, almost-modern forms of indoor
        plumbing over 4,000 years ago! Today farmers in the tropical jungles of
        Mexico are learning to use ancient farming techniques that are much more
        productive and better for the environment than so-called "modern" farming
        practices. But the biggest reason you should care about the past is because
        knowing and caring about the human past is one of the unique things that
        sets us apart from the other living creatures on Earth. Only humans study
        and preserve part of their past, and this knowledge helps us make better
        choices about our future. So you see, it's very important to protect the
        past&#151;not only can we learn to appreciate those that came before us,
        but we can get a lot of good ideas for tomorrow!</span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">This all seems
        like pretty major stuff. Are there laws for stealing artifacts or damaging
        sites?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple"> Yes, there
        are stiff laws against looting (stealing) and vandalism (damaging) artifacts
        on public property&#151;state and city land, parks, forests, and so on.
        People who break these laws face big fines&#151;even jail time&#151;when
        they are caught harming a site. These laws exist to protect important
        "cultural resources" so that they can be properly studied or just left
        alone and saved for future generations. Here in Texas, artifacts and sites
        on private land are not protected by law. Many landowners value knowledge
        about the past and protect the cultural resources on their property. Others
        do not and may intentionally destroy or dig up artifacts and sites just
        to get the "good stuff." This isn't against the law, but it's not a good
        idea. Just think, if everyone did that, we would lose many of our best
        clues to the past. Take the Alamo, for example. About 1900, that famous
        landmark was about to be destroyed to make way for more buildings in downtown
        San Antonio. If it wasn't for Clara Driscoll and the Daughters of the
        Republic of Texas, who stepped in and bought up the Alamo and surrounding
        properties, you wouldn't be able to visit it today!</span></p>
