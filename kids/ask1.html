            <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span><span class="purple"> Well,
              it's not quite that simple. People train for many years before they
              actually become archeologists. You can begin by visiting museums
              and historical places, and by studying subjects like history, science
              and foreign languages. Travel whenever you can and make a point
              of going to historic sites (no, that doesn't mean the oldest ride
              at Disneyland)! If you're looking for an easy way into archeology&#151;read!
              There are loads of books on history; you just have to find out what
              most interests you. </span></p>

     <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">So I don't need
        to start digging anything up? I'm just sure there are some T-Rex bones
        under my dog's house.</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">If you're
        lucky enough to be able to participate in a real dig, go for it! There's
        no better way to see if you like archeology than to get covered in dirt
        and dust! Just remember, there are plenty of ways to dig up information
        on archeology long before you need to dig in the dirt. And by the way,
        paleontologists, not archeologists, study dinosaur bones. You better leave
        that dig to your dog.</span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">When do you get
        to officially be an archeologist? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">Well, some
        archeologists are professionals. They earn their living doing archeology.
        Other archeologists are avocationals. They do it in their spare time,
        so this is a two-part answer.</span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="purple">Most <b>professional archeologists</b>
        get a college degree in anthropology and start working as paid crew members
        on archeological digs to gain experience. Most of those who stick with
        it go on to graduate school, where they continue to study archeology.
        While you're in college, you take special classes that have to do with
        what you think is cool and interesting. For instance, you may need to
        learn about geology and geography and other earth sciences that have much
        in common with archeology. Archeologists also attend &quot;field school.&quot;
        No, they don't study fields, they learn how to dig up artifacts and study
        them! As you can guess, all this education can take a long time&#151;years
        in fact. It's a good thing archeologists love history, because they have
        to learn plenty of it!</span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="purple">Most <b>avocational archeologists</b>
        belong to one or more archeological societies and associations such as
        the Texas Archeological Society (TAS), co-sponsor of this website. Many
        avocational archeologists also study archeology in college or go back
        to school later in life to learn more. Their most important training comes
        through archeological fields schools such as the one run by the TAS every
        June in various locations in Texas. And, the TAS field school has a special
        Kids field school. </span><span class="purple">Avocational archeologists
        also learn lots just by reading and hanging out with other archeologists,
        especially on digs. Serious avocational archeologists often become experts
        in their local area or on a particular topic that interests them. Texas
        has a long history of avocational and professional archeologists working
        together to learn about the past.</span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">Wow! Can I get
        a good job after all that?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple"> Oh, there
        are lots of jobs out there for professional archeologists: museums, government
        jobs, university work. But most archeologists spend only part of their
        time doing field work (remember&#151;that's digging). The rest of the
        time, they're studying the artifacts they found and writing reports on
        them. These reports, just like a research report you write in class, share
        important information that helps others learn history. When you go to
        a museum, there are usually a few paragraphs written about each artifact
        on display. This information tells you what the artifact is and what it
        was used for. What if you went to a museum and saw a bunch of artifacts,
        but none of them had a story? That's exactly what would happen if we didn't
        have archeology reports! So as you can see, there's much more to an archeologist's
        job than digging.</span></p>
      <p><br>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">What's the hardest
        thing about being an archeologist?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">In most jobs,
        you don't get covered with dirt, your muscles don't get sore, you don't
        get dust in your eyes or an aching back. In archeology, you get all that
        and sometimes sunburns too! But that is what it takes to make exciting
        discoveries. Most archeologists, like me, actually love to dig. When I'm
        stuck in the laboratory for too long, I find myself in the backyard doing
        gardening or any other excuse to scratch up some dirt and have a little
        fun. The hardest part about being an archeologist for me is being patient.
        Out in the field, there are days when we don't find anything interesting
        at all. That can get pretty dull. But I live for the other days when someone
        makes a terrific discovery. </span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="purple">You might be surprised to learn that
        many of our most exciting discoveries come not in the field, but weeks
        or months later back in the lab when we finally put two and two together
        and realize something new about the past. Yes, archeologists must be very
        patient and, as you probably know, being patient is not easy!</span></p>
