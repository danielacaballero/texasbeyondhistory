      <p class="text"><b>Who were these prehistoric peoples who lived in the same
        place we know today as Texas?</b> Some were the ancestors of today's Indian
        tribes including the familiar ones such as the Caddo and the Karankawa.
        Others were the ancestors of hundreds of other groups whose names were
        recorded by the Spanish. Most of these groups no longer exist&#151;their
        people died out due to disease, war, and massacre, or were forced to join
        together because of shrinking number. And the hundreds of separate groups
        who were encountered by the Spanish were only the tip of the prehistoric
        iceberg, so to speak. There must have been thousands and thousands of
        named groups in the ancient past whose names are lost to history. Many
        of the best-known Indian groups, including Comanche, Apache, and Tonkawa,
        arrived in Texas during early historic times.</p>
      <p class="text"><b>Truthfully, we have no idea&#151;and never will&#151;what
        most of the prehistoric peoples called themselves.</b> Using archeological
        evidence and oral histories (stories handed down from generation to generation)
        we can sometimes make educated guesses about where some of the ancestors
        of modern tribes lived, but most prehistoric peoples are known only from
        legend and the traces they left behind. Stones and potsherds can't speak.

    <img src="../images/texans/drdname.gif" width="340" height="215" align="left">
      <p class="text"><b>Indian</b> or <b>Native American</b>? We use both to mean the same thing. Most Indian
        people we ask prefer to be known by their tribal names such as Wichita,
        Caddo, or Lipan Apache. Most also prefer &quot;Indian&quot; instead of
        &quot;Native American.&quot; Neither, of course, is really appropriate.
        &quot;Indian&quot; is the term Columbus used because he was confused about
        where he was (he thought he had found India). &quot;America&quot; was
        invented even later. In Canada, some people prefer the term &quot;First
        Nations.&quot; So use what you like, but remember that most people would
        rather be known by their own name for themselves.</p>
      <p class="text">In <i>Imagine It</i> we try to help you imagine some of
        the ways that prehistoric peoples&#151;Indians, Native Americans, or First
        Nation peoples&#151;lived. Please keep in mind that native peoples did
        not all do things the same way. The Caddo peoples living in the forests
        and valleys of East Texas had a very different way of life from the Puebloans
        in west Texas, or the Karankawa living along the coast, or the Apaches
        on the Plains. They had different ways of making a living, different foods,
        different houses, and so on. Multiply this by the hundreds of different
        groups that lived in the land we call Texas during any one period and
        then think about those 540 generations. We hope that some of the examples
        we provide in <i>Imagine It</i> will inspire you to learn more about the
        amazing and fascinating prehistoric past. </p>
