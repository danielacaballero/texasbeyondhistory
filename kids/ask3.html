            <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">What's
              the most famous archeological site in Texas? </b> </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span><span class="purple"> Remember
              the Alamo!! That famous battle cry comes from the most well known
              site in Texas&#151;but it's not known for its archeology. Everybody
              knows about the Alamo because of its role in Texas history. The
              Alamo began as a Spanish Mission, a church compound where Spanish
              priests and their Indian converts lived and worked. To convert means
              to change your religious beliefs. So the Indians that lived in the
              mission with the priests were being taught new and different beliefs.
              You probably don't know the Alamo as a church though. It's best
              known for the bloody battle that occurred there in 1836. Lots of
              artifacts from the Alamo's early history (before the battle) are
              still buried there. We archeologists work there every chance we
              get&#151;usually before some construction project is set to start.
              The construction workers are going to tear up the land anyway, (to
              put in new sewer lines, create a new shopping area or some other
              project), so we get to go dig first!</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="purple">One hot summer about 20 years
              ago, I visited an air-conditioned dig at the Alamo! The old Radio
              Shack store across the street from the Alamo was supposed to be
              replaced by a shopping center. So after the store closed (and before
              they turned off the air-conditioning!), archeologists ripped up
              the wooden floor and started digging. at the Alamo!</span></p>

      </table>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">But I thought
        you said the Alamo was across the street? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">Most people
        think of the Alamo as the famous church with the interesting stone front.
        But the church was only one part of a much larger area, called a compound.
        The Radio Shack store was built on what was left of the Alamo's outer
        wall. Do you think modern shoppers buying the latest electronic gadget
        knew they were on top of an archeology site? Today, that wall is across
        a busy street from the building we think of as the Alamo. Indians used
        to live in that part of the Alamo back when it was still used as a mission.
        The Indian tribes (mostly families) suffered terribly from disease and
        war. They had to move to a new, strange place and learn ways of life that
        made little sense to them. </span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="purple">The people running the mission, Spanish
        priests, brought lots of things&#151;olive oil, fancy painted pottery
        and religious ornaments&#151;from Mexico and Europe. But under the floor
        of the Radio Shack store, archeologists found lots of evidence that the
        Mission Indians kept some of their traditional skills&#151;pottery and
        stone tool making, for example. At the same time, European goods like
        metal tools were taking the place of many native things. Archeologists
        have found all kinds of artifacts there&#151;they even found cannon balls
        and broken weapons from the famous battle! No, they didn't find a set
        of headphones and a CD player&#151;and if they did, they would know it
        was left behind from Radio Shack&#151;not the Native Americans! </span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="purple">I've got to tell you, it was cool to
        be digging in the air-conditioning on a hot August day! </span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">What are some
        of the Indian tribes archeologists study in Texas?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">Well, most
        of the Indian sites we study are "prehistoric." Remember, prehistory means
        <b> <i>before</i></b> written history. None of the Indians that lived
        at those sites left behind a diary saying, "Today, I got sandals and salted
        fish for my birthday." That means that we often don't know a whole lot
        about them. Now, we do know the names of the historic tribes that were
        around when the Spanish and French explorers, traders, and missionaries
        showed up (in the 1500s and 1600s). Just think about it, something like
        500 earlier generations of people lived on the same land you do. That
        means your great, great, great, great, great&#151;say it 500 times&#151;grandmother,
        could have lived in the land we call Texas, and we wouldn't know what
        languages she spoke or what the name of her tribe was. One thing is for
        sure, she wouldn't have been writing any of it down (although she may
        have drawn some pictures about her life. archeologists call this "rock
        art")! One of the best places you can find out more about the Indian tribes
        of Texas is from <a href="http://www.texasindians.com/" target="_blank" class="text">www.texasindians.com/</a>.
        It's a fun, colorful website with some good information on many tribes.
        </span></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">Where can I go
        to see Texas artifacts?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple"> Wow&#151;do
        I have a list for you! There are loads of museums in Texas. In fact, you
        could go to a museum every day for six months and still not see all of
        them! Of course, not every museum contains artifacts. Some contain modern
        art, or cultural items (like the Dr. Pepper museum) that are part of our
        modern society. Other artifact collections are in places that don't seem
        much like museums at all, for example, the French Legation (<a href="http://www.french-legation.mus.tx.us/" target="_blank" class="text">www.french-legation.mus.tx.us/</a>)
        in Austin. As for history museums, there's the Bob Bullock Texas State
        History Museum in Austin, the Texas Seaport Museum in Galveston, the Presidential
        Museum in Odessa, the Institute of Texas Culture in San Antonio. I could
        go on all day! Instead, how about checking this link for more ideas: <a href="http://www.io.com/%7Etam/museum.html" target="_blank" class="text">www.io.com/~tam/museum.html</a>
        (The Texas Association of Museums). </span></p>
      <p><br>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">Who were the
        first people living in Texas?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">Here's a
        scientific answer for you&#151;we don't know! If you're going to learn
        to be an archeologist, you're also going to have to learn to say, "I don't
        know!" After all, the whole science of archeology is trying to find answers
        to unanswered questions about the past. There's bound to be times when
        you just don't have a clue&#151;half the fun is getting to look for them!
        So here's what we <b><i>do</i></b> know: the earliest Texas residents
        we're sure about were people we call "Clovis" after the special spear
        points they made. One of the largest and most impressive Clovis sites
        in North America is right here in Texas near Georgetown. It is called
        the "Gault" site and archeologists from the Texas Archeological Research
        Laboratory are digging there now. You can read more about it in the <a href="../gault/index.html" class="text">Gault
        exhibit</a>.</span></p>
      <br>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">Have any dinosaur
        bones ever been found in Texas?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">Sure, lots
        of them, but that's not my job. I'm an archeologist and that means I study
        the things that people, not the T. Rex or the Tyrannosaurus, left behind.
        Dinosaurs lived in Texas long, long ago&#151;millions of years before
        the first humans arrived. Forget <i>Jurassic Park</i>, no dinosaur ever
        saw a human being and no human being ever saw a (living) dinosaur. The
        scientists who study dinosaurs are called "paleontologists" and you can
        learn more about them by visiting the website of the Texas Memorial Museum.

      <br>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">Did ancient people
        in Texas live in towns? If so, where are the towns now? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">The Indians
        who lived in Texas for at least 13,000 years before the Spanish arrived
        lived in all sorts of places. Some of them were large villages where hundreds
        of people lived&#151;a good example is the place now known as Caddoan
        Mounds State Park. We don't know its ancient name, but the ancestors of
        the modern Caddo Indians lived there about a thousand years ago. Other
        Indians often set up temporary camps along streams and rivers, near springs,
        and many other places. Now, why do you think they liked to live near streams
        and rivers? I'll give you a hint&#151;there was no McDonald's around.
        . On hot summer days, Native Americans couldn't roll into the drive-through
        saying, "Can you super-size that Coke?" One example of a prehistoric village
        is the <a href="../graham/index.html" class="text">Graham-Applegate rancheria
        </a>near Kingsland, Texas. <i>Rancheria</i> is a Spanish word that means
        temporary village. </span></p>
      <br>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">What kind of
        houses did ancient Texans have? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">Lots of different
        kinds. In dry west Texas, the Indians often used natural houses&#151;caves
        and rockshelters&#151;when they needed to get in out of the weather. But
        usually they lived in the open, under the stars. You might be thinking,
        "Hey, cool! Just like camping!" Of course, anyone camping these days knows
        they can go back to their cozy house if it starts to rain, or snow, or
        if the wind is blowing their tent down. But the weather could be a real
        problem for Indians living in temporary shelter. In the winter, most groups
        built some sort of house that kept them warmer, drier and safer. The Caddo
        Indians of east Texas built large houses out of wood and grass that were
        shaped like giant beehives. The Mogollon Indians of far west Texas (near
        what is now El Paso) built rectangular pueblos out of mud bricks called
        adobe. Take a look at the one we archeologists named <a href="../firecracker/index.html" class="text">Firecracker
        Pueblo</a>. The people who lived in the Panhandle sometimes dug large
        holes in the ground and built a roof over this "pithouse"&#151;the earth
        acted as insulation to keep the pithouses warm.</span></p>
      <br>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">What about tepees
        like we see in the movies?</b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">To build
        a tepee, Native Americans needed long poles and lots of buffalo hides.
        They are pretty heavy and can only be moved by horse (or automobile).
        Before automobiles and before the Spanish brought horses back to North
        America, there were no tepees. When the Plains Indian groups like the
        Comanche got horses, their lives completely changed. Instead of staying
        pretty much in one area, they moved wherever they wanted (to hunt buffalo)
        and dragged their teepee poles behind them with their horses. Hey, can
        you imagine dragging your house behind you while you went to find food?
        That could really work up your appetite!</span></p>
      <br>
      <p class="text"><span class="q">Q:</span> <b class="green">How do you know
        where ancient people lived? </b></p>
      <p class="text"><span class="a">A:</span> <span class="purple">We look for
        clues like artifacts, animal bones, and old campfires. If you know what
        you are looking for and you know where to look, there are lots of clues
        left behind by prehistoric peoples all over Texas. Clues like broken stone
        tools, fire-cracked cooking rocks, burned deer bones, clam shells, pieces
        of pottery, and all sorts of other things. Often, we find these traces
        in the same places where people live today&#151;near reliable sources
        of water: creeks, rivers, and springs. But the clues are often hard to
        spot unless you have a trained eye and look carefully. Sometimes we find
        clues on the surface of the ground or perhaps on the side of a creek bank.
        But other times we have to dig. Hey, that's what I do best&#151;I'm an
        armadillo after all&#151;an armadillo archeologist! Texas is my home state,
        and it's full of the two things I love the most&#151;dirt, and history&#151;yahoo!!</span></p>
