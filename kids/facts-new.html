At this mission near Goliad, and at others like it, the Spanish <em>vaqueros</em> taught the Indians to ride, rope, and brand cattle. What we associate with cowboys&#8212;such as saddles, chaps, ropes, lassos, spurs, bandanas, and the rodeo (round-up)&#8212;comes from Spanish <em>vaquero</em> traditions that developed at south Texas missions and at family ranches along the Rio Grande.</li>

They probably covered the new floor with layers of leaves and animal skins to make it softer.

Archeologists found hundreds of these dried remains, called <strong>coprolites</strong>, in what must have been the bathroom area at the back of the shelter.

                structure placed in the waters of Matagorda Bay off the Texas
                coast. It was like digging inside a big room! A big, muddy, wet
