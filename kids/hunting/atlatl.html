  <p class="text">In addition to hand-thrown spears, one of the oldest known hunting 
    devices was a short stick with a funny-sounding name. The atlatl (pronounced 
    at-l&aacute;t-till, or &aacute;-till-lattil) is a spear-thrower, a stick about 
    two feet or so in length made of wood. It functioned as a lever that gave 
    the hunter's throw more power and distance.</p>
  <p class="text">A small prong or hook at one end of the stick held a lightweight 
    throwing spear or dart in place on the atlatl until it was released by a powerful 
    overhead swing of the arm. Hurled to its target, the dart&#151;tipped with 
    a chipped-stone point&#151;would penetrate the animal, wounding or killing 
    it. </p>

    <div class="caption">These ancient chipped stone points were attached to short 
      hardwood foreshafts with wrappings made of animal sinew (the elastic tendon 
      attached to muscles). The foreshafts fit within hollow cane main shafts. 
      Together, they formed darts or throwing spears. Prehistoric hunters used 
      atlatls to hurl these darts at their prey. Click to enlarge picture.</div>

  <p><span class="purple">
  <p class="text">The darts were often made in two parts: a long main shaft made 
    of hollow cane, and a short foreshaft made of hardwood. The flint dart point 
    (often called a spear point or, mistakenly, an arrowhead) was tightly fastened 
    to the &quot;business&quot; end of the foreshaft. The other end of the foreshaft 
    fit snugly into the end of the hollow main shaft. <span class="purple"> </span></p>
  </span><span class="purple">
  <p class="text">Although simple in design, the atlatl was a very effective weapon. 
    Because it extends the length of the human arm by about 18 inches, it allowed 
    a hunter to throw a dart much farther-the length of a football field-than 
    he could without it and with the force necessary to bring down large game. 
    When Spanish soldiers entered what today is Mexico, they encountered Aztec 
    warriors with atlatls (the funny-sounding name comes from the Aztec's language). 
    The soldiers soon learned the hard way that darts hurled from atlatls could 
    penetrate their metal armor!</p>
  <p class="text">The atlatl is a very ancient weapon&#151;no one really knows 
    how old, but it was in use in the Old World at least 20,000 years ago. It 
    is likely that the earliest people to enter the New World were equipped with 
    it.</p>
