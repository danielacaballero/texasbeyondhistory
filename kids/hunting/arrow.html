  <p class="text">Around 1200 years ago, the atlatl was replaced by the <b>bow 
    and arrow</b>. This weapon gave hunters even more accuracy, distance, and 
    speed in their shots. It also allowed hunters to be more secretive. They could 
    move up on and shoot their prey while crouching behind a bush or from within 
    a prairie of tall grass. This was a clear advantage over the old-style hunting 
    method: hunters using an atlatl could hurl a dart or spear only when they 
    were standing erect, revealing their position to an easily spooked herd of 
    deer. Hunters could also carry many more arrows than darts on their hunting 
    trips.</p>

  <span class="purple"> 
  <p class="text">Bow and arrows differed in size and shape, as well as the materials 
    used to construct them. Early bows were often 3 to 5 feet in length&#151;taller 
    than a man, in some cases! After Spanish explorers brought horses into the 
    New World and Native Americans began hunting on horseback, shorter bows were 
    developed for ease of handling. The mounted hunters and warriors were skilled 
    with their weapons, whether hunting buffalo or engaged in battle. Texas Ranger 
    Noah Smithwick recalled that Lipan Apache Indians could shoot a dozen arrows 
    in the time that it took for a man to load a muzzle-loading gun.</p>

  <div class="caption"> Late Prehistoric people made chipped stone points to tip 
    their arrows in many sizes and shapes. These arrow points were found in archeological 
    sites in north and central Texas. Although some are smaller than a dime, they 
    could kill game as large as buffalo.</div>
