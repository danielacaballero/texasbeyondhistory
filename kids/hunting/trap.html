  <p class="text">When hunting small animals such as birds, rabbits, and other 
    small game, early hunters used a variety of clever weapons and devices to 
    keep from destroying the feathers, skin, or fur. While arrows or darts would 
    cut into and bloody the pelts, devices such as rabbit sticks, bunts, traps, 
    and snares left the pelts intact. The pelt could be used for making clothing 
    or covering, and the meat for food. </p>

  <span class="purple"> 
  <p class="text">The <b>rabbit stick</b>, or throwing stick, is a simple piece 
    of curved wood about 1&frac12; to 2 feet in length. Although it looks similar 
    to the Australian boomerang, the rabbit stick was not designed to come back 
    after it was thrown. Hunters would hurl the throwing stick at the animal or 
    just use it as a club in order to stun and kill him. </p>

   <span class="purple"> 
  <p class="text">One strategy was to stretch nets across narrow spots, such as 
    a stream valley or gully. Then hunters and their families would walk through 
    the bushes, making noise, to drive rabbits and other small animals toward 
    the net. The hunters would then run to the animals and club them to death 
    with their sticks. This may sound cruel, but it was an effective hunting technique 
    before there were guns or farm-raised animals. </p>

    <div class="caption">Archeologists found this section of a wooden scissors 
      snare in a dry cave in southwest Texas. Click to enlarge.</div>
   </div>
  <span class="purple">
  <p class="text"><b>Traps and snares</b> were used to capture a wide variety 
    of small animals, such as cottontail rabbits, prairie dogs, mice, and rats. 
    Many devices were complex in design, but were made of very simple materials, 
    such as wooden sticks and cords made of fiber. The <b>scissors snare</b>, 
    for example, springs into action when an animal places pressure on a stick, 
    rigged as a trigger. It worked something like this. The hunter places a small 
    piece of food, used as a bait, on a stick near the &quot;V&quot;-shaped opening 
    of the snare. When an animal sticks its head through the opening and takes 
    the food, the trigger is released. This causes the V-shaped &quot;scissors&quot; 
    to snap shut, pinching the small animal in a deadly choke hold.</p>
  <p class="text">Another type of trap, the <b>deadfall</b>, was simple but deadly, 
    as its name suggests. When animals were lured into this device, they usually 
    ended up crushed and smashed beneath a heavy rock. To set the trap, hunters 
    placed bait food on a trigger stick underneath a huge rock slab or heavy log, 
    standing on end. When the animal took the bait, it triggered a release mechanism, 
    causing the log or rock slab to crash down upon the prey.</p>
  <p class="text">Fish were an important food in prehistoric times, just as they 
    are today. Prehistoric fishermen used hooks made of bone or thorns attached 
    to a line made of fiber or sinew. They also used nets made from plant fibers 
    and traps called weirs, constructed from woven sticks, to catch fish. They 
    also pounded the bark of certain trees to create a poison that could be thrown 
    in the water to temporarily stun fish. The fish would be netted up and eaten 
    (the poison didn't harm humans). <br>
