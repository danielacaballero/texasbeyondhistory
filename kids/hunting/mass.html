  <p class="text">With skillful planning, organization, and luck, prehistoric 
    hunters could occasionally succeed in killing dozens or even hundreds of animals 
    at a time, using little or no weaponry. Archeologists call sites where some 
    of these kills occurred, &quot;<b>jump sites</b>.&quot; To the animals, however, 
    it was a &quot;plunge of death.&quot;</p>
  
  <p class="text">The &quot;jump&quot; kill involved what seems like a simple 
    plan. Hunters would frighten or spook a herd of buffalo off of a cliff or 
    high bluff. But to make the plan work required strategy. The right site had 
    to be located, the animals had to be directed to the spot, and they had to 
    be stampeded over the edge.</p>

  <p class="text">At the Bonfire jump-site in southwest Texas, archeologists found 
    the bones of hundreds of buffalo that plunged over a cliff to their death 
    on a massive pile of rocks. Native American hunters in the area had used the 
    kill site as early as 12,000 years ago! It is clear, however, that prehistoric 
    hunters did not stage mass kills frequently. They were once-in-a-lifetime 
    events for the hunters. There was evidence of perhaps only four successful 
    jump-kills at the Bonfire site over its long history. Many other times hunters 
    must have tried and failed to trick the buffalo into &quot;falling for&quot; 
    their plan.</p>
  <p class="text">There were other methods for mass kills. Prehistoric hunters 
    also herded buffalo into enclosed areas, such as box canyons, or into corrals 
    made of poles where they would kill the trapped animals. </p>

  <h3 class="red">Butchering the Kill</h3>
  <span class="purple"><p class="text">After the jump, hunters and women from the prehistoric group 
    would begin the massive task of skinning and butchering the animals. They 
    dragged the animals' enormous hides away from the butchering area to later 
    be tanned, or softened, by smearing them with fresh buffalo brains. Hunters 
    ate the best meats, including the tongues, on the spot, and often drank the 
    animals' warm blood.</p>

<span class="purple">
  <p class="text">Hundreds of pounds of meat would be sliced into thin strips 
    that were spread out on wooden racks to be smoked or dried by the sun. The 
    dry strips (jerky) could then be stored for later use, often as an ingredient 
    in pemmican (an early trail mix). Enormous leg bones were crushed to get at 
    the rich marrow inside, and bone bits were boiled to capture the fat in a 
    greasy broth. The butchering, smoking, and skin curing process lasted weeks, 
    but the payoff was huge. Hundreds of pounds of meat, bone for tools, hide 
    for cover and clothing, hair for ropes, sinews for cording&#151;the list of 
    useful items from a buffalo seems endless! </p>
