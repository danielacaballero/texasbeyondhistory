  <p class="text">Hot rock cooking? That's right! It's a very efficient technique 
    developed thousands of years ago for preparing large quantities of food that 
    require long, slow cooking. In fact, underground earth &quot;ovens&quot; are 
    still used in some areas of the world today. </p>
  <p class="text">First, shallow holes or pits were dug in the ground. Then a 
    fire was built in the pit and large rocks such as limestone or basalt were 
    added on top of the burning wood and coals. After several hours, the rocks 
    would be so hot, they glowed, reaching temperatures of over 750 degrees! Then 
    a layer of green plants such as wet grass or prickly pear pads was added, 
    then the food (such as sotol bulbs), then a another layer of green plants. 
    The green plants provided moisture (steam) and kept the food from burning 
    and getting dirty. The whole heap was then covered with a thick layer of dirt 
    that served as a lid to hold in the heat.</p>
  <p class="text">Some foods would be kept in the oven for two to three days before 
    they were ready to eat. The heated rocks stored and slowly released heat (energy) 
    and allowed prehistoric cooks to conserve fuel. Slow cooking also turned bulbs 
    and root foods into sweet nutritious meals. Indians would cook the bulbs and 
    stalks of plants such as lechuguilla, agave, sotol, and wild onions which, 
    when raw, were practically inedible or even poisonous. Some meats were also 
    roasted in earth ovens, but for much shorter times. </p>
