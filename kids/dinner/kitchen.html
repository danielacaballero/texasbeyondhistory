    the center is using a mano and metate to make flour for the &quot;pancakes&quot; 
    baking on the flat stone over the fire. In the background, strips of meat 
    have been hung to dry over wooden racks. Pottery jars (shown near the fire) 
    served as the &quot;pots and pans&quot; of Late Prehistoric people. (Painting

 <span class="blue">
  <p class="text">Just as we use blenders, Cuisinarts, and other food processors 
    today, Indians used a variety of tools to prepare their foods for cooking. 
    Made of stone or wood, these simple tools required a lot of human energy to 
    power them, in order to crush, pound, and grind the thousands of hard seeds, 
    grains, or nuts needed to make flour or meal. As you will learn below, one 
    of the tools was a special Indian version of a &quot;nut cracker.&quot; (This 
    has nothing to do with the doll or the play, by the way.)</p>

    <div class="caption">Archeologists built their own wooden mortar and pestle 
      as an experiment. Next to it is a pile of whole mesquite beans, ready for 
      pounding. (Click to enlarge.)</div>
  </div>

  
  <p class="text">Mortars and pestles may have been the first such tools used 
    by prehistoric peoples. A mortar is the &quot;bowl&quot; part of the tool, 
    where the food was placed to be crushed. Mortars could be as simple as a hole 
    or depression in a flat rock. Other mortars were made of a hollowed-out log. 
    To complete this &quot;machine,&quot; an instrument called a pestle was needed, 
    either a long rounded stone or a wooded stick with a rounded end. Many of 
    the wooden mortar and pestles resembled butter churns. Regardless of the shape 
    or size of the processing tools, the food&#151;hard nuts and seeds&#151;could 
    be pounded to a pulp or meal (like cornmeal or flour) and could then be mixed 
    and cooked into griddle cakes or flat bread, or added to meat or soups.</p>

                                <div class="caption"> A prehistoric stone mortar 
                                with a hollowed out center is being excavated 
                                from an archeological site called Firecracker 
                                Pueblo near El Paso, Texas.</div></div>
	
  <p class="text">The mano and metate also were used for grinding seeds and nuts 
    such as acorns into a powdery meal. Made of flat, rough stone, metates were 
    used as a grinding slab. Although not as deep as the mortar, some metates 
    have a surface that dips slightly inward, like a shallow trough. The mano 
    is the hand piece, a rounded stone which was rubbed back and forth, or in 
    a circular motion, over nuts or seeds within the metate. Dried meat was also 
    ground and mixed with the seeds and nuts to make a food called pemmican.</p>
	
  <p class="text">One of the most compact tools the Indians 
    used was their version of a &quot;nut cracker.&quot; Called &quot;nutting 
    stones,&quot; these are small stones with a little dimple or depression in 
    their center. Indian cooks would place a nut&#151;such as a pecan&#151;in 
    the small dimple. They would then crack the nut with another stone and pick 
    out the nutmeats from the shell. It was not like the nutcrackers we use today, 
    but they worked!</p></span>
