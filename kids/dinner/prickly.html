  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Prehistoric Indians knew that getting food 
    from some plants took lots of skill. Some of the best foods were from spiky, 
    prickly, or thorny plants. For instance, mesquite pods have to be picked from 
    trees with wicked thorns. Blackberries grow on long thorny vines. And prickly 
    pear cactus&#151;well, it's very prickly! But the pads and fruits, called 
    tunas, can be delicious.</span></p>

  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Some of the most unexpected food sources 
    are fibrous plants with big bulbs or roots such as sotol, lechuguilla, yucca, 
    and agave. Tackling these plants meant dodging knife-like leaves with sharp 
    pointed tips, a sometimes painful chore. Spanish explorers traveling across 
    the Texas Plains tangled with these menacing plants. It's no wonder that one 
    variety of these plants is now called Spanish Dagger!</span></p>
