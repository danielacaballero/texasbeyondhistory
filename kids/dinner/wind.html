  <p class="text">Some Indians used a handy food-processing trick involving wind-power. 
    The trick is called winnowing, a fancy term for using wind to separate seeds 
    from the chaff (stems, husks, and other debris). Many grasses and other flowering 
    plants produce seeds. But most seeds are tiny and surrounded by husks, seed 
    covers, dried flowers, and stems. While seeds are highly nutritious, they 
    are a real chore to clean.</p>
  <p class="text">When batches of seeds are gathered, they are usually full of 
    stem fragments, dust, and other unwanted items. To sort out the seeds from 
    the chaff, Indians used the winnowing process. Instead of picking the seeds 
    out by hand (can you imagine picking out thousands of seeds by hand?), they 
    would place the batch of seeds in a flat basket or tray. Then they would toss 
    the contents into the air and let the wind blow away the unwanted lighter 
    material, such as husks, small bits of grass and dirt. The slightly heavier 
    seeds would fall back into the basket, ready to be parched (dried), ground 
    up, and made into flour.</p>
  <p class="text">There was a major drawback in the winnowing method, however. 
    If it wasn't windy enough, then the chaff and dust would not blow away and 
    if it was too windy, the seeds would blow away too. It's hard to imagine having 
    to rely on a windy (but not too windy) day in order to get food for tomorrow's 
    meal.</p>
