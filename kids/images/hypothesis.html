              she usually takes the dog for a walk about that time of day and 
              both she and the dog weren't home. Still, to prove a hypothesis 
              you must &quot;test&quot; the idea by trying to find evidence that 
              proves your hypothesis is right. Using the same example, you might 
              need to see if anyone had seen your mom walking the dog, or if the 
              dog leash was hanging on its hook. This evidence would help prove 
              your hypothesis until your mom returned and told you that she had, 
              in fact, been out walking the dog. Archeologists do the same thing. 
              They make an educated guess based on what they know and then they 
              try to find evidence to try to prove their hypothesis is true. </p>
            <p class="text">Now for an archeological example. Let's say some archeologists 
              find a piece of burned pottery near some other artifacts&#151;ashes 
              and animal bones. They might hypothesize that the pottery was used 
              for cooking. To test that theory, they would need to take the pottery 
              back to the lab and see if there were any traces of food on it. 
              If they found food traces, their hypothesis could be proven true.<!-- #EndEditable --></td>
