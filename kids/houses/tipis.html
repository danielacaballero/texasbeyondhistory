  <p class="text">When you hear the words, &quot;Indian,&quot; or &quot;Native 
    American,&quot; you probably think of tipis. But, as a matter of fact, most 
    Indians did not live in tipis. Tipis were used mainly by Plains Indians, such 
    as the Lipan Apache, Comanche and Kiowa, after the Spanish introduced horses 
    into North America about 500 years ago. Plains Indians groups moved across 
    the Great Plains following migrating herds of buffalo that ranged from Canada 
    to Texas. </p>
  <p class="text">Plains Indians used the buffalo for many purposes, including 
    buffalo hide coverings for their tipi homes. Dozens of long wooden poles formed 
    the cone shape of the tipi. Many large buffalo hides, sewn together, were 
    draped across the poles to form an enclosed tent. The hides could be rolled 
    up on hot summer days to let cool breezes blow through the tipi.</p>

  <span class="purple"> 
  <p class="text">Most tipis were relatively small and could hold only four or 
    five people comfortably. The chief's tipi, however, was much larger because 
    tribal meetings were often held there. A dozen or more people could fit comfortably 
    within this larger dwelling. There were no furnishings, such as we might use 
    today. Beds inside tipis were no more than buffalo hide mats and blankets 
    layered on top of piles of grass and hay&#151;very light weight and easily 
    packed up for traveling. A small fire in the middle of the tipi was used for 
    cooking and to provide warmth. Smoke escaped through a hole at the top of 
    the tipi.</p></span>

    <div class="caption">Native Americans used dogs or horses to drag their homes

   </div>
  <span class="purple"><p class="text">When the group was ready to move on, they took apart their tipis 
    to bring with them. The tipi's wooden poles and buffalo hide could be made 
    into a sort of &quot;moving van&quot; called a <i>travois</i>. The travelers 
    packed all their belongings on the travois, a type of sled pulled by dogs 
    and later by horses.</p>
  <p class="text">Tipis were used more widely and were built to be much larger 
    after Europeans brought horses to North America in the 1500s. Using &quot;horse-power,&quot; 
    Indian groups could carry more possessions, including the much larger tipis 
    and huge wooden poles. The caravans of Indians on horseback and their horse-drawn 
    sleds sometimes stretched for miles.</p>
