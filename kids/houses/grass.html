  <p class="text">Houses made of grass? That's right&#151;but there was nothing 
    flimsy about these structures. Underneath the grass or thatch covering there 
    was a sturdy framework of long wooden poles (small trees) linked by smaller 
    branches that ran across the poles. The large beehive-shaped grass houses 
    of the Caddo and Wichita peoples were permanent dwellings found mainly in 
    East Texas and adjoining areas of neighboring states. Grass houses were much 
    larger than tipis, sometimes reaching 50 feet tall and housing two or more 
  families!</p>
  </span><span class="purple"><p class="text">Building a house was a special event in the Caddo village. Both 
    men and women, directed by several overseers, worked together in the construction. 
    First, they drove long solid wooden poles into the ground in a circle from 
    30 to 50 feet across. Then they laid a lattice grid of smaller branches across 
    the poles. Finally, reed or grass bundles were woven together across this 
    framework in a method called thatching. The thick bundles were so tightly 
    woven that the house was both waterproof and windproof. The thatch served 
    as insulation as well, keeping the interior warm in freezing weather and cool 
    on a hot summer day.</p></span>

	<span class="purple"><p class="text">Inside each house, many beds were arranged around the circular 
    walls of the house. The bedframes were made of light wood and were raised 
    a few feet off the ground. Each bed was covered with buffalo hides, and the 
    occupant was given a bit of privacy by hide curtains draw around each bed. 
    The rest of the house was lined with shelves to store baskets full of nuts, 
    corn, beans, jars made of clay, and food processing equipment such as mortars 
    and pestles. </p>
  <p class="text"> A shallow firepit or hearth in the middle of the &quot;living

  <p class="text">Caddo peoples and their ancestors lived in the piney woods of 
    East Texas from about A.D. 800 to 1700 (about 300 to 1200 years ago). They 
    hunted deer and small animals, gathered wild foods, and grew corn, beans, 
    and squash on their farms. Caddo potters made beautiful decorated vessels 
    out of the East Texas red clay. </p>
	
  <p class="text"> Around 1300, the Caddo began building wooden temples atop towering 
    mounds of earth. Some mounds contained tombs where great leaders were buried. 
    Sadly, during recent times many mounds have been dug up by treasure hunters 
    or flattened by farmers. Today, the remaining mounds provide silent clues 
    of the Caddo era of greatness (ca. A.D. 1200-1700). During historic times, 
    the Caddo withstood disease, colonization, and forced relocation. Some groups 
    had to join with others. They were forced to leave Texas and today have their 
    tribal headquarters near Binger, Oklahoma.</p>
