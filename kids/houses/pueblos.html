    communities. This painting by artist George Nelson shows how everyday life 
    might have been at Firecracker Pueblo near what is now the city of El Paso.</div>

  <p class="text">Indians living in far west Texas did not have access to tall 
    grasses for thatch or buffalo hides to cover their homes. What they did have 
    was dirt, rock, and straw and, with these materials, they made their adobe 
    houses in communities called <i>pueblos</i>. </p>
  <p class="text">Adobe is mud and straw mixed together and dried to make a strong 
    brick-like material. Pueblo peoples stacked these bricks to make the walls 
    of the house. Gaps between the bricks were filled with more mud to block the 
    wind, rain, and to keep out bugs and other unwanted pests. </p></span>

    <div class="caption">Indians of the southwest made bricks out of dirt and 
      straw and dried them in the sun to build their pueblos. Over time, rain 
      and wind would cause the bricks to &quot;melt&quot; away.</div>
  </div>
 <span class="purple"> <p class="text">Wooden posts inside each room supported the roof which was covered 
    with layers of sticks, then grass, mud, and finally plaster. Pueblo peoples 
    plastered their walls and floors and often painted them with red, yellow, 
    white, and black bands.</p>
 <p class="text">Some pueblos were very large with more than 100 rooms! The rooms 
    were built in long rows and could house many families. Most pueblos had large 
    underground rooms called kivas that were used for ceremonies and meetings. 
  </p>
  <p class="text">Structures made of adobe would not stand up to long periods 
    of rain&#151;over time they would dissolve! Adobe homes were only built in 
    the very dry parts of West Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and 
    Mexico.</p></span>

  <p class="text">Just outside El Paso in far west Texas, archeologists uncovered 
    the remains of a large pueblo built around 500 years ago. The archeologists 
    named it Firecracker Pueblo because of a firework stand nearby. Firecracker 
    had more than 15 rooms. Most rooms had hearths or fireplaces near the center 
    of the south wall. The largest room is probably a communal or meeting room 
    and had two hearths and rows of small pits used for storage.</p>
