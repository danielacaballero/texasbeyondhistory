    lower walls of the houses, there is no way to know how the roofs were constructed.

  <p class="text">Between 500 to 900 years ago, people in what we call today the 
    Texas Panhandle lived in villages along the Canadian River and other stream 
    valleys. These first settlers of the Panhandle grew their own crops, hunted 
    buffalo and other game, and collected many wild plants. For shelter, they 
    built sturdy houses made of stone and an early type of cement within a shallow 
    pit. These houses were cool in summer's heat and withstood the blasts of cold 
    air that often sweep across the Plains in winter. Archeologists have found 
    the remains, or ruins, of many of these houses, which they have named <b>slabhouses</b> 
    because of the slabs of stone that formed the lower walls.</p>

    <div class="caption"> Archeologists uncovered the remains of a large hearth 
      in the center of one of the rooms in a 900-year-old slabhouse. The ruin 
      has been named Hank's House, because it was found on the ranch of John Erickson, 
      author and creator of Hank the Cowdog! Click to enlarge.</div>

 <span class="purple">
  <p class="text">To construct their houses, the villagers would dig a pit about 
    2 or 3 feet below the surface of the earth. Then they would line the dirt 
    walls in the pit with stone slabs. Above ground level, they would add walls 
    of stone and mud mortar (cement). The roofs of these houses were made of grass 
    and wood. Some archeologists believe the roofs were slanted in a pyramid shape, 
    while others believe the houses resembled adobe pueblos with their flat roofs. 
    Like pueblos, some slabhouses were built in blocks of rooms to accommodate 
    several familes. Sometimes an individual family would construct their slabhouse 
    far from other people, perhaps to be closer to fields to grow crops. </p>
  <p class="text">The people who lived in these slab-houses hunted small game 
    such as rabbits and birds but also larger animals like deer and buffalo. They 
    ate wild berries and nuts in addition to the corn and squash they grew themselves. 
    For their stone tools and weapons, they quarried a colorful stone that we 
    call Alibates flint. It is found only in the Texas Panhandle and parts of 
    Oklahoma.</p></span>
