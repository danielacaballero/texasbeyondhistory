  <p class="text">Wickiups were homes to hunting and gathering peoples who moved 
    from place to place, sometimes staying perhaps a few days or several weeks 
    in one location. Their homes were easy to construct from wooden sticks and 
    brush found at each campsite. Whereas tipis were tall and cone-shaped, wickiups 
    were short and squat. But unlike tipis, which were taken apart and moved from 
    place to place, wickiups were just left behind when Indian families moved 
    on. </p>
	
  <p class="text">These small, round houses were made of thin, flexible pieces 
    of green wood bent to create a dome. Small branches were wrapped around the 
    dome to make a grid. In cool weather, animal hide or thatch was used to cover 
    the frame, sometimes only on one side to block the north wind. A small firepit 
    was dug in the middle of the wickiup. Wickiups were much smaller than the 
    thatch houses of the Caddo and only a few people could sleep in one. </p>
