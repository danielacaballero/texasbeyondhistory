    no one is safe. A couple of years ago, poor Phil Reynolds had just left my

    people keep coming back to get their salt. <img src="images/kettle1.jpg" width="143" height="75" align="right">They 
    can't exist without salt. Salt is not just used to make food taste better. 
    Way out here, we have no ice to keep meat fresh. We need salt to preserve 
    beef and pork to make it last a long time. We need salt to make butter. Horses 
    and cows have to have it, too, or they will die.</i></p>

  <p class="text"><i>Soldiers also need salt. General Sherman himself once declared

    With the protection of a small cannon, I can defend my saltworks against any 
    future raids the Comanches might be planning. Without a heavy gun, though, 
    I cannot continue. I'll just load my iron kettles and all my equipment onto 
    my wagon, shut down my operation, and move on. If that happens, we all lose. 
    There's not another source of salt anywhere near this settlement.</i></p>

        <p class="margintext" style="float:right"> Because Ledbetter's salt was 
          so important to the people of Fort Griffin and The Flat, William Ledbetter 
          got his cannon at the fort that day. The next time his salt works were 
          attacked by Indians, he fired his cannon until he ran out of ammunition. 
          As the Indians retreated, he loaded a heavy metal bolt into the cannon 
          and fired again. But the attacks on the isolated settlement continued, 
          in spite of the firepower from the cannon. In 1870, Ledbetter's youngest 
          son wandered off from school at the Lynch Ranch. The settlers thought 
          he must have been carried away by Comanches. A party of citizens and 
          soldiers searched the area but could find no trace of the missing boy. 
          Another man was killed in an attack the following day. Ledbetter's young 
          son was never found. Ledbetter held out for another 10 years and the 
          moved to the nearby town of Albany, finally abandoning his saltworks.

          <br>
          Making salt was a simple process if you had a source of salty water. 
          Ledbetter had a spring on his place near the Salt Branch of Hubbard 
          Creek. First he pumped salty water from the spring into his heavy iron 
          pots. Then he lit a wood fire under the pots and let them cook until 
          all the liquid boiled away, leaving salt on the bottom. After it dried 
          in the sun, the salt was put in burlap bags, ready to sell.</p></td>
