    these steaming pots. I work for the Army. I came out west to Ft. Griffin with 
    the 17th Infantry in May of 1868. I'm a washerwoman. I get paid to wash the 
    soldiers' clothes. That may not sound like very high and mighty work to some 
    people but, let me tell you, I earn my keep. Why, last July, my husband's 
    paycheck was only $13. Do you know what I brought in that same month? $40. 
    $40!<img src="images/johns.jpg" width="167" height="262" align="left" alt="photo of longjohns"> 
    That's just about what the head laundress here makes every month&#151;because

    days lolling around, talking up the men, like some women I won't name.</i></p>

  <p class="margintext" style="float:left; width:250px"> <b>Recipe for Lye Soap 
    </b><br>
    <br>
    11 pounds of hog grease <br>
    2 quarts of lye <br>
    7 gallons of water<br>
    <br>
    Heat water in big heavy pot on fire. Add lye, being careful not to touch it. 
    Drop in grease and boil and stir for about 4 hours. Try out soap in small 
    saucer. If it's hard, take it off fire. Stir a chicken feather in it. If feather 
    gets cut, it's done. Pour out into flat pans and let set for<img src="images/ticks4.jpg" width="19" height="23" align="absmiddle"> 
    about two weeks. Cut into bars.<br>
    <br>
    Best to make it when the moon is right or it won't set right </p>
  <p class="text"><i>Do you see those white canvas tents over yonder, on the far 
    edge of the post? That's where most of the laundresses live. Everybody calls 
    it "Suds Row." I lived there when I first came here. But once I got married, 
    my husband was allowed to move out of his barracks (that he shared with five 
    other men) and move into a new house with me. We now live in this cute little 
    frame house with its own kitchen. True, it's not much to look at on the inside, 
    but who has time to fix it up pretty?I'm up before the sun, keeping the fires 
    going under my pots all day so I keep the <img src="images/tick.jpg" width="55" height="65" align="right" alt="photo of a tick">

    this wild land. Every day but the Sabbath, I'm up and working&#151;soaping

    I have to chop my own firewood. At night, when I lay down to sleep, my shoulders

    over my head. No, I'm not complaining. I saw much worse misery when I was

  <p class="margintext" style="float:left"><b>Cleaning the Army's Clothes </b><br>
    <br>
    Although the Army depended heavily on the laundresses to keep soldiers' clothes 
    and bedding clean and free of bugs, the women generally were treated poorly. 
    They were usually housed in tents at the far edges of the fort, and some were 
    forced to sleep on the ground. At some forts, the women had to chop their 
    own firewood in addition to doing the many heavy loads of wash each day. Although 
    the pay was fair, the work was hot, exhausting, and dangerous. They worked 
    over vats of boiling water and scalding steam, and made strong lye soap that 
    could burn arms and hands. There are reports of laundresses burning to death 
    after their long skirts brushed too close to the fires. </p>
