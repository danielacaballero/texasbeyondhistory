 The groups of Indians that became known  as the Tonkawa moved into the area that is now Texas during the mid-1700s. 
    They later became friends of American settlers and scouts and warriors for 
    the U.S. military, helping to fight the Comanche and other tribes. In spite 
    of the help the Tonkawa gave to the soldiers and settlers, the Tonkawa were 
    forced to move to Indian Territory, north of Texas. There, in 1862, about 
    half of the 300 remaining Tonkawa were killed by members of other tribes. 
    The desperate Tonkawa survivors were allowed to moved back to Texas and set 
    up a small village near Fort Griffin, where they again served as scouts for 
    the Army. After the war, they were moved back to Indian Territory. By 1890, 
    there were only 56 Tonkawa surviving.</p>
