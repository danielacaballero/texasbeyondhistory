  <span class="blue"> 
  <p class="text"><i>Look, I mind my own business and I suggest you do the same. 
    </i>(With a toss of her head, Lottie Deno hurries off down the street.)<i> 
    <br>
    <br>
    </i>(A woman standing nearby was listening. Now she steps forward, whispering:)<i> 
    </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><img src="images/lottie2.jpg" width="148" height="300" align="left">Psssst... 
    <br>
    She acts just like a high-class lady, doesn't she? Talks like a lady, walks 
    like a lady, dresses like a lady. Don't be fooled by her cool manner. That 
    woman is no lady. She's a lady gambler. That's right. She makes her living 
    by playing cards and taking people's money. She calls herself Lottie Deno. 
    We call her the Poker Queen. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><a href="images/lottiedeno.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/lottiedeno-sm.jpg" width="192" height="316" align="right" alt="photo of Lottie Deno" class="thumbimg"></a>She's 
    a mysterious one, too. Her past is a deep, dark secret. Some say she was educated 
    in the best schools on the East Coast and comes from a wealthy family. Who 
    knows what her real name is. In San Antonio, she went by Carlotta Thompkins. 
    Here she calls herself Lottie Deno. We hear she got that second name from 
    a man she cheated at cards. He told her she should change her name to "Lotsa 
    Dinero" </i>[which means "lots of money"]<i>. Apparently, "Miss Dinero" or 
    "Deno" as she decided to rename herself, has gambled her way here from San 
    Antonio up through the fort towns. They say she is looking for her boyfriend 
    who had to flee San Antonio because he killed a man. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><img src="images/stagecoach.jpg" width="200" height="121" align="left">All 
    we really do know about Lottie Deno is that she arrived here alone one evening 
    about two years ago on the Jacksboro stage. She was riding up top of the coach 
    with the driver! She rented a cabin on the edge of town. There she lives like 
    a hermit, receiving no callers, male or female. She goes out only to shop 
    or to gamble. But when she does go out, she always carries her pistol. At 
    night, you can find her at the Bee Hive Saloon, playing poker. <a href="images/gambler.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/gambler-sm.jpg" width="274" height="200" align="right" alt="photo of antique poker cards, chips and dice" class="thumbimg"></a>Folks 
    say she's good at cards, that she's more than a match for the best of the 
    professional gamblers who pass through here, like Smoky Joe and Monte Bill, 
    who follow the buffalo hunters and the men trailing cattle to Dodge. Miss 
    Deno bets high and wins big. Pity the poor cowboy who finds himself across 
    the poker table from this enchanting redhead with the sparkling black eyes. 
    She will soon relieve him of any silver he might have jingling in his pocket.</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>It's true that she's not so bad as some of the saucy girls 
    who work in those saloons. She lives fairly respectably, always keeping the 
    peace. She's run up a debt or two but who here hasn't? I've never been in 
    the Bee Hive but Deputy Sheriff Herron has. He says he's watched her in there 
    and that liquor has never touched her lips. But imagine a woman making a living 
    in a such a wretched place! All those wild men drinking, cursing, smoking, 
    and fighting. True, she has to make a living, but like that?</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>No, we could never receive a woman with that kind of reputation 
    into polite society, even if she does put an honorable face on it. That's 
    why we townspeople had to do what we did. We just couldn't invite a woman 
    of her sort to come to one of our dances. That sort of a thing just isn't 
    done here.</i></p>
  </span> 
  <p class="margintext">Lottie Deno was a woman of mystery whose true name may 
    never be known. She was born in Warsaw, Kentucky in 1844. Her father, a wealthy 
    plantation owner, loved to race horses and gamble. He took Lottie, his oldest 
    child, to gambling casinos around the world. After he died in the Civil War, 
    the young woman was sent to Detroit, where her mother hoped she might meet 
    a suitable husband. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/steamer.jpg" width="285" height="148" align="left" alt="steamboat">Instead, 
    Lottie, along with her nanny, a 7-foot-tall black woman, met up with Johnny 
    Golden, one of her father's former jockeys. The three sailed the Mississippi 
    River, becoming expert in the riverboat gambling parlors. After they split 
    up, Lottie met and fell in love with Frank Thurmond. But Frank took off for 
    West Texas. Some say he killed a man in a card game. Lottie followed him, 
    gambling her way from town to town. <br>
    <br>
    At Fort Griffin, Johnny Golden, the jockey-gambler, came back into Lottie 
    Deno's life&#151;but not for long. He found his former sweetheart dealing 
    cards at the Beehive Saloon. One day later, he was shot dead on the street 
    behind the saloon. <br>
    <br>
    Lottie followed Frank to New Mexico, where they eventually became respected 
    citizens. She gave up gambling and helped establish an Episcopal church in 
    the small town of Deming. She died in 1934 and was buried next to Frank. </p>
