  <p class="margintext" style="float:left" align="center"><b>Languages and Traditions:</b> 
    At the Tonkawa camp outside Ft. Griffin, Tonkawa women carried on the traditions 
    of the tribe, one of which was making beautiful beaded moccasins. Living in 
    poverty, many were forced to sell their creations to travellers or ranchers. 
    After living among the Anglos, the Tonkawas began to pick up bits of English 
    that helped them communicate better so they could sell the things they made. 
    This language sounds funny to us today. After reading it, we may think the 
    woman was stupid. But she had to be smart to speak English. It was not her 
    native language. It was her second language. Some Tonkawas even learned to 
    speak Spanish, which made them trilingual. </p>

    Some Tonkawa women served as scouts for the U.S. Army. One scout was a short, 
    fair-skinned woman known as "Texas Tonk." In June of 1872, Texas and other 
    scouts rode out of Fort Griffin with soldiers from the 10th Cavalry. After 
    a long day of scouting, the small Indian woman did not return to join the 
    others. Concerned that the scout had been caught by the Comanches, a search 
    party was sent out, but they found no sign of her. Another group was sent 
    to look for her, and they found the scout dead at King's creek near the Clear 
    Fork of the Brazos River. Texas had died only 15 miles northeast of her home. 
    She was buried near the creek. </p></td>
