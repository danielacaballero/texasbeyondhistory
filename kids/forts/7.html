  <p class="text"><i>I am here on official business. I am General William Tecumseh 
    Sherman, the commanding General of the United States Army. I am here to inspect 
    the frontier forts. In the past few months, both the Congress and the War 
    Department have been bombarded with angry letters, petititions, and memorials 
    from Texas politicians and citizens. According to these reports, Comanche 
    and Kiowa Indians continue to raid throughout the West Texas frontier, robbing 
    and murdering with wild <img src="images/flag.gif" width="208" height="114" align="left" alt="graphic of the US flag">abandon, 
    despite the presence of U.S. soldiers. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>The insults against the Army and its Indian Policy have become 
    so loud and so continuous of late that I have made this personal trip from 
    Washington to investigate. In this way, I will be able to learn the facts 
    myself and see if there is indeed cause for alarm. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><a href="images/griffin.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/griffin-sm.jpg" width="300" height="124" align="right" alt="photo of Fort Griffin in the late 1870's" class="thumbimg"></a>I 
    am accompanied by my staff, a light escort of soldiers from the Tenth Cavalry, 
    and Inspector General R. B. Marcy. Our journey began in San Antonio on May 
    2. Since departing the Alamo City on that date, we have proceeded in a northerly 
    fashion, visiting Forts Mason, McKavett, Concho, Chadbourne, and Phantom Hill, 
    before stopping here at Fort Griffin for two days.<img src="images/sherman2.jpg" width="177" height="298" align="left" alt="photo of General Sherman" class="thumbimg"></i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>Upon my arrival here, I was met by a mob of outraged settlers. 
    They recounted yet more tales of Indian incursions onto their land. They demanded 
    that I assign more soldiers to Fort Griffin to protect their property and 
    homes. My attempts to calm their fears were made in vain. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>Although my tour of inspection is not yet complete, I have 
    already formed an opinion on the matter in question. I have come to believe 
    that these reports of Indian atrocities are exaggerated-greatly exaggerated. 
    True, as General Marcy pointed out, the frontier is much depopulated. We passed 
    many deserted cabins along our way here. General Marcy faults the Indians. 
    <a href="images/headress.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/headdress-sm.jpg" width="128" height="232" align="right" alt="photo of Indian headdress" class="thumbimg"></a>I 
    disagree. The settlers simply moved for lack of water. I have seen not a trace 
    of an Indian thus far to persuade me otherwise. I am convinced that whatever 
    Indians do cross the Red River enter Texas only to steal horses</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>This frontier is a peaceful one. I am confident in this knowledge. 
    If the situation was truly perilous, why would I put my own valuable scalp 
    at risk? If the Indians were indeed patrolling the trail, they would have 
    surely spied our stately entourage by now and attacked. Yet we have not seen 
    even one moccasin track. If I were the least bit concerned about the safety 
    of this area, would I travel along in a clumsy wagon with only a handful of 
    men to protect me? Absolutely not. If my life were in danger, I would want 
    a swift horse for the chase and a huge body of armed men to cover me. </i> 
  <p class="text"><i>At this time, I see no reason to recommend any further addition 
    of soldiers to the frontier defense or a change of our Indian policy. In time, 
    the Indian problem will resolve itself and settlers will flood into this area. 
    Texas has a very agreeable climate and I believe, one day, will enjoy great 
    prosperity. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>Tomorrow we depart for our last Texas post, Fort Richardson.

  <p class="margintext"><b>Sherman's Narrow Escape on the Texas Frontier</b><br>
    Gen. Sherman made it safely to Fort Richardson, but the north Texas frontier 
    was far from safe. A few days after Sherman passed by, a war party of Kiowa 
    Indians attacked a wagon train on the same road. The Kiowas, led by Chiefs 
    Sanatanta, Satanka, and Big Tree, had watched Sherman and his escort pass 
    but chose not to attack him. Their assault on the wagon train, which resulted 
    in the brutal death of the wagon master and six teamsters, is known as the 
    Warren Wagon Train massacre. Sherman ordered Col. Ranald Mackenzie to puruse 
    the Indians across the Red River and capture them on their reservation in 
    Indian Territory. With this action, the U.S. Army changed it's attitude to 
    frontier defense, and began an all-out assault on the raiding Indians.</p>

    Famous General</b><br>
    William Tecumseh Sherman, one of the most famous generals in the Civil War, 
    served as commander of the Union forces in many southern states. He led the 
    capture of the important southern cities of Atlanta, Savannah, and Charleston, 
    South Carolina. After Atlanta surrendered, Sherman tried to further break 
    the morale of the southern people. "I can make Georgia howl," he stated. He 
    sent more than 60,000 troops in a "march to the sea," with orders to destroy 
    anything and everything that might help the Confederate forces. Sherman was 
    one of many famous generals who spent time in Texas. Before the Civil War, 
    Robert E. Lee, John Bell Hood, Phillip Sheridan fought in the Indian Wars 
    on the Texas frontier. </p>
