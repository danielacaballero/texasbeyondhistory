  <p class="text"><i>To make some money, I hope. Do you see all those wagons lining 
    up behind me? They're mine. They're piled high with 2,000 buffalo hides, each 
    one cured and ready to sell. My name's Joe McComb. I'm a buffalo shooter. 
    Meet Poe and Jacobs, my associates. They're skinners. We rode into The Flat 
    today to meet a buyer named Charley Rath. Folks say he's opened a hideyard...that 
    he not only buys but ships the hides. That saves us from having to haul them 
    over to Ft. Worth. We hear he pays $2 for clean hides, ones without cuts or 
    holes. If that's the case, we'll make a tidy profit. My skinners are careful. 
    Their knives don't slip and cut the hide when they skin the carcass.</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><a href="images/hides.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/hides-sm.jpg" width="300" height="241" align="left" alt="photo of stacked buffalo hides" class="thumbimg"></a>Ahhhh! 
    This noisy, dusty town is a sight for sore eyes. To think that it was only 
    six months ago that we left here. It must have been just around Thanksgiving 
    when I got it in my head to rig up a buffalo hunt. I'd never been on one before. 
    But there's big money in buff hides right now. I discovered that back in '71 
    when I trailed cattle to Dodge. There I saw tens of stacks of buffalo hides 
    stockpiled by the railroad tracks. Those stacks were as high as a man standing 
    in a wagon could throw them. A railroad man told me that tons of hides were 
    being shipped to the East. Factories use them for machinery belts. People 
    wear them as robes or cover their floors and walls with them. <a href="images/shooter.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/shooter-sm.jpg" width="250" height="281" align="right" alt="photo of Sharp's rifle demmonstration" class="thumbimg"></a>He 
    said that the hides are in great demand. Brokers are paying top dollar for 
    them. I thought of the thousands of buffalo that grazed freely in West Texas 
    between October and May. But that was in Indian Territory. Few white men had 
    ever even set foot there, much less hunted the Indian's prey.</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>But a lot has happened in the three years since my visit 
    to Dodge.<a href="images/cooking.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/cooking-sm.jpg" width="200" height="201" align="left" alt="photo of buffalo tongue preparation" class="thumbimg"></a> 
    Col. MacKenzie and his soldiers have pushed more and more of the troublesome 
    Indians out of the Llano Estacado and back onto the reservation at Ft. Sill. 
    Now the area is open to white buffalo hunters. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>So Poe, Jacobs, and I decided to make a go of it. We put 
    together provisions and a camp outfit and, on the day after Christmas, were 
    ready to roll. We struck camp at Mocking Bird Springs&#151;west of the Old 
    Stone Ranch&#151;and miles away from any settlement or home. <a href="images/skinners.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/skinners-sm.jpg" width="300" height="220" align="right" alt="photo of hide hunters skinning a buffalo" class="thumbimg"></a>We 
    knew we were flirting with an attack by rogue Indians. But we felt confident 
    that our big, long-range guns would keep any enemy at a distance. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>It was a freezing cold winter. Many chilly mornings we emerged 
    from our flimsy tents to find a white world of snow. The cold, especially 
    a norther, brought with it thousands of buffalo. We hunted in the morning 
    and skinned in the afternoon. First, we located a herd. Then I took a stand 
    downwind of it. I set up my Sharps .44 on a stake and waited. I studied the 
    herd, picking out the leader, usually a bull. <a href="images/hunterscamp.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/hunterscamp-sm.jpg" width="300" height="204" align="left" alt="photo of a buffalo hunters' camp" class="thumbimg"></a>I 
    shot it first. When it fell, the other buffs would mill about, dazed, until 
    another bull took over the leadership. This would start a stampede. In all 
    this confusion, I was able to pick off another 25 to 50 buffalo before the 
    herd had enough sense to run off or scatter. Then the skinners would do their 
    work. We went on like this, day after day, month after month, moving camp 
    only once, until the herd began to migrate north last month. Now our hard 
    work is over. It's time to sell our haul and reap our reward. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><a href="images/gear.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/gear-sm.jpg" width="350" height="267" align="right" alt="photo of various tools of the buffalo hunting trade" class="thumbimg"></a>I 
    think we are just about to wear out our welcome here at the Flat. Having brought 
    the hides down this main street may not have been a good idea. Notice the 
    horses tied up in front of that saloon. They're getting very restless. They're 
    snorting and pulling at their reins, threatening to pull loose from their 
    hitching posts and run away. It's because they've smelled the hides in our 
    wagons. We'd better get a move on. Otherwise, some tanked up gambler might 
    burst from that saloon, find his horse had bolted, and come looking for my 
    hide! </i></p>
