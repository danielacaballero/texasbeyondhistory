    must be a party going on in every shop in town&#151;all that shouting, banjo 
    music, and war whoops are making my head just pound. There's a hitching post 
    in front of every business and every one of them is tied with horses. I don't 
    know how the stagecoach will be able to leave, after the driver picks up the 
    mail. This street is just jammed solid with mules and wagons. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>All of a sudden, I feel a bit faint. Did I tell you that 
    I just stepped off that stage? My legs are as stiff as boards from being crammed

    you. A cool drink is just what I needed. This lemonade tastes like nectar 
    of the gods. Yes, yes, I remember. You asked me, why I am here at the Flat. 
    Well, I'm visiting my sister, Marie. It's been years since we've seen one 
    another&#151;and I simply adore Marie. We keep up in letters, you know. She's 
    married to an officer stationed up at the fort. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>I've come all the way from Baltimore to see them. And what 
    a tedious trip it has been&#151;part by rail, part by stage. It has taken 
    me weeks to get here, traveling through wild prairies and across flooded rivers! 
    I hardly had a wink of sleep, worrying about Indians and wild animals along 
    the way. And crowded as I was between the other passengers, there was no way 
    to sleep anyway, except sitting straight up! </i></p>

    But my silk stockings are simply ruined, I tell you, and there's nowhere to 
    buy another pair this side of Baltimore. Right now, in this wild west town,

    horseback over the prairie with the men and maybe have a picnic and look for 
    buffalo or wolves. I do hope the green wool riding suit I packed will be suitable

    journeys were bumpy, boring, and often dangerous, but passengers were willing 
    to undergo the discomfort to reach their destinations. Speed was always on 
    the minds of the drivers, even though they usually averaged only about 4 to 
    5 miles per hour. They had to stay on schedule in order to get fresh horses 
    at stations along the way. They had mail to deliver and passengers to pick 
    up and drop off. Stage roads were nothing like the roads we know today. Sometimes 
    they were little more than a rocky ledge along a steep hillside&#151;with 
    barely enough space to run the wheels&#151;or muddy ruts across grassy prairies. 
    <a href="images/butterfieldschedule.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/butterfieldschedule-sm.jpg" width="250" height="348" align="right" alt="photo of the Butterfield Overland Mail schedule" class="thumbimg"></a>Water 
    crossings were especially treacherous, when the horses might have to swim 
    across rain-swollen rivers. Across craggy mountains and through muddy prairies, 
    the threat of breakdowns was constant. Many a stage driver found himself stranded 
    miles away from the nearest help, with a group of frightened passengers on 
    his hands. Stage stations along the route provided a place for travelers to 
    briefly escape their cramped quarters, refresh themselves and have a hurried 
    meal. While some provided rooms for travelers to rest, other stations were 
    little more than crude huts made of sticks and mud. The trip from St. Louis 
    to San Francisco on the Butterfield Stage took about 25 days, and some passengers 
    never left the stage to rest, other than for the brief stops along the way. 
    (The Butterfield Stage Company operated in Texas from 1857 to 1861, before 
    Fort Griffin was constructed. Other stage companies later ran lines through 
    many of the same stops across the state.) </p>

    Stage Traveler's Diary: Near Colbert's Ferry on the Red River, Texas (1858) 
    <i> I awoke but once during the night, having been jolted into a position 
    where my neck felt as if it had a knot in it. They had stopped at a station 
    to change horses, and for the time not a sound could I hear. I had been dreaming 
    of the Comanche Indians, and in the confusion of drowsiness, first thought 
    that the driver and the mail agent had been murdered, and that I, being covered 
    up in the blankets, had been missed; then I recollected that I had a pistol 
    and thought of feeling for it; but finally I thought I would not stir, for 
    fear the Indians would see me&#151;when I was brought to me senses by a familiar 
    voice saying, "Git up there, old hoss," and found it was the driver hitching 
    up a new team.<br>
