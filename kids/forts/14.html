  <span class="blue"> 
  <p class="text"><i>Why is anyone here? To have a good time! Stick around and 
    see what I mean. Right now the only real activity you see in the street is 
    merchants and saloonkeepers getting ready for business, right? In another 
    hour, though, look up the hill toward the fort. Tens of soldiers on pass will 
    be coming this way. Out of the west, cowboys and buffalo hunters will appear 
    on the horizon, galloping in from their camps. Visitors lodging in local hotels 
    and boardinghouses will drift out into the streets. <a href="images/doc.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/doc-sm.jpg" width="156" height="377" align="left" alt="photo of Doc Holliday" class="thumbimg"></a>All 
    will be headed here&#151;to Griffin Avenue&#151;with purses and pockets just 
    bursting with money. They'll duck into one of the saloons clustered on this 
    main street to gamble, dance, and drink.</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i>That's where I step in. My name is John Henry Holliday&#151;Doc 
    Holliday, to you. I once was a dentist but I deal faro and poker now, right 
    here, at Dick Shannessy's Saloon. I'm a professional gambler. I make my living 
    winning at cards. </i>[He pauses. He is seized by a fit of coughing.]<i> Now 
    you know why I had to switch occupations.<img src="images/colt.jpg" width="289" height="144" align="right"> 
    What patient wants a dentist who coughs in his face while his tooth is being 
    pulled? </i>[He reaches inside his waistcoat and produces a handkerchief, 
    coughing into it. When he does so, a gun is visible in his breast pocket.]</p>
  <p class="text"><i><img src="images/docandwyatt.jpg" width="200" height="340" align="right">I 
    was dealing faro and poker in Jacksboro before I came to Griffin. I had to 
    leave Jacksboro, though, or face the hanging tree. I killed a soldier there. 
    I plugged him with my six-shooter because he cheated me at cards. He can't 
    say I didn't warn him because…</i>[Again, he is wracked by coughing. This 
    fit is so strong that he doubles over with pain. He recovers himself and continues.] 
    <i>Anyway, Jacksboro was over for me even before I killed the soldier. For 
    a year I had high times there playing poker with the cowboys on their way 
    to Kansas with their herds. But those days are over for Jacksboro. The cattle 
    trails have shifted west. This new trail&#151;the one that leads not to Wichita 
    but to Dodge&#151;goes straight through Ft. Griffin. This is where the money 
    is now. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><img src="images/cardsfaro.gif" width="96" height="150" align="left">Now 
    look at the town. It's starting to happen. You can almost hear a buzz as the 
    town hums to life. Already a few customers are lining up at the bar behind 
    us. Soon, gamblers will be placing bets at my faro table. Time for me to roll 
    up my sleeves and get to work…A man has to live while the living is good…</i>[He 
    disappears through the swinging doors of the saloon.]</p>

  <p class="margintext">Gunman and gambler John H. Holliday became a legendary 
    figure in the West during the late 1800s. Some of that legend began in Texas, 
    at Fort Griffin&#151;the town called The Flat. It was there that Holliday 
    met the Earp brothers and the woman who was to be his lifetime companion, 
    "Bignose" Kate Elder. Born in Georgia, John Holliday was a sickly and sensitive 
    child whose mother doted on him. But she died when he was only 15, and the 
    grief-stricken young man went away to school to study dentistry and escape 
    his unhappy home. Well-educated, well-dressed, and charming with the ladies, 
    Holliday's future looked bright as he began practicing as a dentist in Dallas, 
    Texas, in 1873. He hoped the dry climate there would help cure his sickness, 
    tuberculosis&#151;known then as "consumption." <br>
    <br>
    "Doc" Holliday, as he was called, might have lived a quiet, even ordinary 
    life had it not been for his disease. But Doc was frequently overcome by fits 
    of terrible coughing that frightened his patients, who worried they might 
    catch the sickness. Coached by his cousins, Doc turned to gambling to help 
    pay his bills. So began his journey, one that was to take him far from his 
    very proper upbringing in the old South. <br>
    <br>
    In the following years, Doc traveled from town to town, but was "escorted" 
    out by the sheriff on many occasions. In The Flat, he dealt faro at the Beehive 
    Saloon, and began a life-long friendship with Wyatt Earp and the Earp family. 
    Their paths crossed again in other wild west towns, such as Dodge City, Kansas. 
    In Tombstone, Arizona, Doc and the Earp brothers faced off with the Clanton 
    family in the "Gunfight at the OK Corral." Doc's skill in handling guns made 
    him famous, but some people believe that the gentleman dentist made up some 
    of the stories to create his legend and protect himself as his sickness weakened 
    him over the years. He died in a hotel room in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, 
    in 1887. </p>
