    of a shopping spree. Where's the big sale? </font></b></i></span></p>

  <p class="text"><i>Mercy me! Wild horses couldn't have kept me away today. Haven't 
    you heard? Why today's the grand opening of the new Conrad and Rath general 
    store. One of the owners, Frank Conrad, says he carries "the largest stock 
    of merchandise west of Fort Worth." Just one peek inside is to believe it. 
    There's <a href="images/handbill.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/handbill-sm.jpg" width="200" height="267" align="left" alt="handbill from Conrad and Rath general store" class="thumbimg"></a>something 
    there for everyone. The place is packed cheek to jowl with customers. Cooks 
    are restocking their chuckwagons with coffee, flour, sugar, and fancy medicines, 
    cowboys are trying on high-heeled boots and $50 Stetson hats, and buffalo 
    hunters are buying imported cigars, gunpowder, and bullets. There's something 
    for everyone.</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><img src="images/cannedfood.jpg" width="345" height="245" align="right" alt="photo of canned food">While 
    I was shopping, I saw neighbors I haven't seen in months. Oh, it was so good 
    to catch up with dear Myrtle and hear about her mother…And to think she rode 
    18 miles to be here for this occasion. After we finished chatting, I nearly 
    lost my head in the fabric section. I got carried away looking at all those 
    pretty bolts of printed calico and silk and yards of ribbon and tubs of buttons 
    and pins and needles and thread that I plumb forgot to watch my kids. Just 
    look at Little Billy now! He looks like a silly wet dog. His hair is all rumpled 
    and sweaty from rolling around on the wool feed sacks. <img src="images/candy.jpg" width="200" height="112" align="left" alt="candy sticks">And 
    Susanna! There's no telling how many peppermint sticks and licorice drops 
    she helped herself to from the jars on the counter. Such a cute little red 
    and sticky mouth, though. </i></p>
  <p class="text"><i><a href="images/store.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/store-sm.jpg" width="300" height="241" align="right" alt="photo of the inside of a frontier store" class="thumbimg"></a>Is 
    this icy wind cutting through your clothes like it's cutting through mine? 
    Why don't we go back inside the store where it's warm? My husband, William, 
    says we don't have to head back to the ranch just yet. He saw how excited 
    we <a href="images/conradrath.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/conradrath-sm.jpg" width="200" height="171" align="left" alt="photo of the Conrad and Rath general store" class="thumbimg"></a>were 
    to be here and decided that, to buy some time, the wagon could use some repair 
    while we were in town. So he took it and the horses over to the livery stable, 
    around the corner. Once we're inside the store, you and I could pull up a 
    chair by the stove and sip coffee and chat while the menfolk look at guns. 
    Josiah wants to show Little Billy a Winchester carbine he has his eye on. 
    He needs a new one because his old one broke. We have to have a new gun. We 
    need it for hunting and protection. The wolves are particularly thick this 
    winter. <img src="images/cannedfood2.jpg" width="158" height="159" align="right" alt="photo of canned food"> 
    We have to keep them away from the herd. If we lose our cattle, we'll have 
    nothing.</i></p>
  <a href="images/cook.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/cook-sm.jpg" width="300" height="398" align="left" alt="photo of poineer interpreter cooking" class="thumbimg"></a> 
  <p class="text"><i>When we've finished our coffee, I want to show you the shelves 
    of canned peaches and milk and the crates of sperm candles&#151;ready-made. 
    Also, I saved just enough money to buy some pickles and soda crackers and 
    a pound or two of dried apples. Do you mind standing with me in line to keep 
    me company? Oh, I think I'll just about burst, waiting for spring. That's 
    when Frank Conrad says he'll have fresh tomatoes to sell. Just think how beautifully 
    those red fruits will dress up my drab greens of dandelion shoots and poke 
    salad. My family gets so tired of eating just plain meat and bread. It'll 
    be like a party to have fresh fruits and vegetables at suppertime.</i></p>
  <p class="text"><i> Oh, I sure wish we didn't live so far up Lambshead Creek. 
    If we lived at The Flat, I could come here every day and shop. But that might 
    not be such a good idea. If I did that, I might spend so much of our savings 
    that I'd land us in the poorhouse!</i></p>
