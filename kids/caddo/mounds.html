  <p class="text"><span class="blue">For hundreds of years, the ancient Caddo 
    people built earthen mounds in the special places where their leaders and 
    priests lived. Some mounds were platforms for grass-thatched temples on top, 
    where priests lived and held special rituals. In other mounds, the Caddo people 
    buried their leaders inside elaborate tombs. The imaginary painting above 
    shows a funeral procession winding up the side of a burial mound.</span></p>

      of dirt that will be used to add a new layer to a mound.</div> 
  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Each mound was made from thousands of basketloads 
    of soil dug from large holes called &quot;quarry pits.&quot; Workers carried 
    the heavy baskets, one by one, and mounded up the dirt in a slow, back-breaking 
    process. </span></p>
  <div class="fl200"><img src="images/temple.jpg" width="200" height="254">

    <div class="caption">This shell ornament, cut and engraved with a mysterious 
      design, was a grave offering found in one of the burial mounds. Beautiful 
      Caddo pots and polished stone tools, such as the axe shown at bottom, right, 
      were also left as offerings to the departed loved ones.</div>
  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Unlike the burial mounds that held graves 
    inside, the <b>temple mounds</b> contain layer after layer of the charred 
    remains of large wooden buildings that were once temples or the house of important 
    leaders (Caddis). Periodically, the buildings were taken apart and burned, 
    perhaps because they were gettting too old or perhaps for special ritual occasions. 
    After the buildings were burned down, they were carefully covered with a fresh, 
    thick layer of earth. This is how temple mounds formed&#151;layer by layer 
    over long periods of time. Then a new temple was built on the exact same spot, 
    a foot or two above the charred remains of the old one. </span></p>

  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Over time, community leaders lived and died 
    and were buried in the <b>burial mounds</b>. With each death, there were days 
    of ceremonies with special rituals, mourning, and feasting. Some Caddo tombs 
    dating to 500-1000 years ago contain the remains of more than one person&#151;sometimes 
    as many as 6 or 8. Archeologists who have excavated these mounds suspect that 
    servants and perhaps even family members were sacrificed and buried alongside 
    the powerful leader to honor his (or sometimes her) death.</span> </p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Once the bodies were laid out, the Caddo 
    people carefully added special items as offerings within the grave of the 
    leader&#151;jewelry made of bone and shell, finely decorated pots, and special 
    stone tools.</span> These things symbolized the importance of the person buried 
    there.</p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Some graves were covered over with a framework 
    of poles and long grass, to make a roof-like covering over the bodies.</span>

  <div class="fl200"><img src="images/cycle.jpg" width="200" height="257"> 
    <div class="caption">Caddo workers dump basketloads of soil on top of a mound 
      to start a fresh surface. </div>
  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Finally, workers brought in layers and layers 
    of fresh earth to cover the tomb and make a fresh surface on the mound. Then 
    the cycle of building, living, dying, and rebuilding began all over again. 
    </span> </p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">In ancient times, the temple and burial mounds 
    were built around plazas&#151;flat open spaces like parade grounds&#151;in 
    villages that archeologists call &quot;ritual&quot; or mound centers. These 
    centers were special places where the Caddo gathered for rituals, festivals, 
    and meetings. Sometimes traders and leaders from far away came to meet with 
    Caddo leaders, bringing in special items from their lands, such as copper 
    from the midwest, stones from the Appalachian Mountains and marine shells 
    from the Gulf coast. In return, the Caddo may have given the visitors their 
    beautiful clay pots, fine bows made of the wood of the bois d'arc tree, and 
    salt, a particularly important mineral. </span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Over hundreds of years of use, the mounds 
    in the village centers grew larger and larger. The largest ones at the oldest 
    centers must have looked like small hills looming overhead, showing their 
    importance to the villagers and visitors alike. Archeologists who have excavated 
    the mounds have found that some contained up to seven different surfaces, 
    or layers, and reached as high as forty feet above the ground! That's as high 
    as a four-story building! It must have taken loads and loads of dirt to build.</span>

      Site at Alto, Texas, has fascinating displays telling the story of the Caddo. 
      You also can hike on trails where the ancient village once stood and see 
      the remains of mounds at the site.</div>
  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Today some of these mounds still stand as 
    silent and mysterious places. Many others have been destroyed by farming, 
    road construction, grave robbers, and, yes, even archeologists (who are considered 
    grave robbers as well by some Caddos).</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Today, archeologists, the Caddo people, and 
    state officials are working together to help preserve and study these sites. 
    One of the best places to see a Caddo mound and learn more about Caddo life 
    is at Caddo Mounds State Historic Site in Alto, Texas. The site is maintained 
    by the Texas Historical Commission. Their <a href="http://www.thc.state.tx.us/hsites/hs_caddo.aspx?Site=Caddo" target="_blank" class="text">website</a>
