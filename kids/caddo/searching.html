    <p>For more than 30 years, students and professors from the University of 
      Texas have studied the remains of Caddo villages in East Texas. At left, 
      a student gets ready to look through an instrument called a transit that 
      will help her make a map of the site. In the center, Dr. Dee Ann Story, 
      (standing in the center photo at right), watches over students as they carefully 
      excavate a house area. Now retired from teaching, Dr. Story still does research. 
      At right, she examines a stain in the soil with one of her former students, Dr. Darrell Creel, director of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. 
      They have returned to the site to try out some new, high-tech ways to learn about 
      the Caddo!</p>

    for Clues </h2>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Archeologists have many ways to study the 
    traces of the Caddo past. When they excavate a site, they carefully dig through 
    layers and layers of dirt and debris, going back perhaps hundreds, if not 
    thousands, of years in time. Usually, the deeper they dig, the older the deposits 
    and the farther back in time they go.</span></p>

  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Just like people today, the Caddo people 
    left behind lots of trash: bits of food (bone, corn cobs, etc.), broken pieces 
    of pottery, fragments of tools, jewelry, and countless other things. These 
    items (artifacts) help us understand a great deal about how the Caddo lived.</span> 
  </p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">But there is lots more to study than artifacts. 
    Archeologists also study much larger clues, such as patterns and stains in 
    the dirt that may be the remains of hearths, storage pits, houses, and temples. 
    Studying the tall Caddo mounds requires months and months of intensive labor.</span>

  <p class="text">Look at the circular pattern of holes in the ground uncovered

    <div class="caption">This computer-generated map made from information collected 
      at Caddoan Mounds State Historic Site shows the magnetic differences created 
      by disturbances to the soil, such as the digging of holes for posts and 
      trash pits. The diagonal line on the right of the map is the magnetic &quot;signature&quot; 
      of a modern hiking trail. That was definitely not made by ancient Caddo 
      hikers! But the circles you see are very likely the pattern left by  Caddo houses. </div>
  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Archeologists today have found a way to &quot;look&quot; 
    underground without ever lifting a shovel! Using geophysical (geo = earth) 
    survey technology they wheel a special instrument back and forth over a large 
    area. Each time they reach one side of the search area, they move the instrument 
    over another three feet or so and go back the other way. They repeat this 
    trip many times before the whole area is covered. The instrument detects small 
    changes in the magnetic field of the earth, changes caused by holes dug and 
    fires built over 800 years ago! </span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">The instrument collects this data (information), 
    which is then downloaded into a laptop and later transfered to a larger and 
    more powerful desktop computer back in Austin. Using a series of specialized 
    software programs, the analyst creates a special computer-generated &quot;map&quot; 
    of the entire area. Archeologist will use this map to &quot;see&quot; beneath 
    the ground. By studying the patterns, they can understand the size and layout 
    of the village that once stood here. </span></p>
    
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">This special map covers just a small section 
    of Caddoan Mounds State Historic Site, an ancient ritual center with mounds 
    and traces of a large village. Over the years, archeologists have excavated 
    small parts of the huge site. But unless they dig everywhere (which would 
    take decades), they have no way of knowing just how big the ancient village 
    was. The new geophysical survey technology allows them to explore the whole 
    area, including traces of houses and other buildings.</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">As you can see, there are several obvious 
    patterns on the map. Can you guess what they may represent? </span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Go ahead, try your hand at being a high-tech 
    archeologist! We won't know if your guesses are correct until more tests are 
    done at the site. (That means clearing off the grass and looking for stains 
    and remains of wooden posts in the ground, like the archeologists are doing 
    in the photo at top right.) Like many other sciences, archeology requires 
    slow, careful, and detailed analysis. But there 's a lot that can be learned 
    by adding up all the clues.</span></p>
