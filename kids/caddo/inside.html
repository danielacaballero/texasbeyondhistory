    inside</span></b><span class="brown"> this snug and warm Caddo house. It's
    a cool, rainy autumn day, so the women have brought their work inside to be
    near the hearth fire. The children are playing while their mothers, aunts,
    and grandmothers prepare food and make pots, just as their ancestors did for
    hundreds and hundreds of years before. While they play, the children are watching
    and learning how to scrape the seeds from the centers of big, bright sunflowers
    to dry and use for food. </span></p>

      site in Louisiana. Click to enlarge it. Can you see the design that looks
      like a bird? </div>
  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="brown">The children can practice weaving strips
    of cane into baskets or colorful mats. Do you see all the ways the Caddo people
    use the woven mats in their houses? Some are used as wall dividers between
    the beds, while others are scattered on the dirt floor to provide a dry place
    to sit. </span></p>

    you see the &quot;closets&quot; where Caddo families keep their belongings?
    Actually, there are no closets, only storage bins made of cane shelves that
    are hanging on the wall. Some contain extra clothing and blankets made of
    furry hide rolled into bundles. Others hold tools and extra pots. Some hold
    the families' most precious items, like the specially made pot that has a
    duck head perched on the side. Can you find it? <b class="red">Click on it</b>
    to see a similar pot found by archeologists at a Caddo site. </span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="brown">Another pot in one of the wall bins looks
    like an ear of corn. Can you find it? It's hidden off to the left. <b class="red">Click

    in east Texas.</span></p>

    <div class="caption">These are ears of what we call Indian corn. The first
      corn grown by the early Caddo would have had been smaller, with blue and
      rust-colored kernels, like these. The corn our farmers grow today is bigger
      and sweeter, but not as favorful or colorful&#151;it's mostly yellow, although
      some is white. </div>
  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="brown">One woman sitting next to the fire is pulling
    the shucks off ears of corn grown in the fields nearby. The Caddo eat some
    of the corn after it is freshly picked, in soups and stews, but they are careful
    to store plenty of it, dried on the cob, for food during the winter. Some
    corn is always dried and hung up high at the top of the house. It is kept
    there through winter to use the following spring. It is the seed for planting
    next year's crop!</span></p>

  <p class="text"><span class="brown">There are several clay pots on the fire.
    I wonder what's cooking for dinner? Perhaps it's a tasty stew of beans, squash,
    and corn flavored with a little deer meat or bear fat. </span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="purple"><img src="images/fire.gif" width="150" height="145" align="left"></span><span class="brown">The
    beds look warm and cozy in this house. They are made of mats hung between
    four posts, kind of like a hammock. They are covered with furry blankets made
    of deer or buffalo hides. The fire is always kept burning, not only to cook
    food on and provide warmth, but as an important religious symbol, the gift
    of fire.</span></p>
