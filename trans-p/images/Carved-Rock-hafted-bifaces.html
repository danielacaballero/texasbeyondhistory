<div class="caption">Kelley  found these two remarkable artifacts  on a lunch break during the excavations  when he decided to investigate a narrow crevice between two fallen boulders.  Imagine his surprise to discover these hafted bifaces or knives.  These had been carefully placed  in the crevice hidden from view, an idea that fits with the notion that dry rockshelters sometimes served to store tools or food items for later use.  As can be seen, the large stone tools had been inserted into slots carved into crudely cut wooden handles and wedged into place with small fragments of wood. TARL Collections. </div>
