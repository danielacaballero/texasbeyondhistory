<p>One of the most impressive panels at Alamo Canyon is called the the Storyteller Woman Panel. This panel was described by Alex Apostolides in an article in The Artifact in 1984. This panel is approximately 9 meters long by 2 meters high. At its north end is what appears to be a woman with her arm extended as if to “gesture” to the viewer to follow the panel. According to Apostolides, an Apache informant suggested that the woman is a “storyteller”. The role of a storyteller in many Indian tribes is of great importance because they retain and pass on tribal history and knowledge.  This large panel seems to tell the story of a particular group’s migration to the area.
