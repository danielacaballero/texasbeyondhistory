<div class="caption"> The Paradise earth oven cross-sections as reconstructed by Ohl.  The upper diagram shows the functional parts of the earth oven. The lower diagram adds the trough ringing the baking pit from which the earth was taken that sealed in the moist heat while the  desert succulents slowly baked.  Clear evidence of such troughs is very unusual and was detected through careful excavation.  The trough was visible as a dark stain because it had been filled with carbon-stained soil after the oven was opened and the baked goods removed.  Graphic by David Hart.  </div>
