<div class="caption">FA recently recovered Folsom base from southern Presidio County. This specimen was found approximately one kilometer from the stone quarry from which the raw material used to make the point was retrieved. This kind of evidence suggests the Folsom groups in the area were quite familiar with local resources.  In other words, they were not just passing through on hunting trips.  CBBS, Sul Ross.</div>
