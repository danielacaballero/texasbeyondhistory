      <p class="text"><strong> Activity: </strong></p>
	  <p class="underline">Day1-</p>
      		<p class="text"> Step 1:  Ask students to give examples of famous paintings they’ve seen. Point out that while most paintings we recognize today were painted on canvas or wood, thousands of prehistoric and historic pictures were painted on rock in caves and open areas all over the world. These paintings are called pictographs. Archeologists can use carbon dating to determine the approximate age of the paints used in a pictograph, but we can also gain understanding of pictographs by knowing about the environment, culture, and area in which they were created.</p>
     		<p class="text"> Step 2:  Display the following questions on the board or overhead transparency:
			<ul>
			<li>Describe the kind of person you think created your pictograph. </li>
			<li>What materials do you think were used to create it?</li>
			<li>Knowing what you do about the area and era that produced your pictograph, what information or "story" do you see in your pictograph?<br><br>

View examples of pictographs included in this lesson.  As the class views the images, point out which area of the world each is from and in what historical era it was produced. Explain that after researching the era and area that produced each pictograph, students will make inferences from their research information to write a short essay that will answer the above questions.
</li>
			</ul></p>
<p class="text"> Step 3:  Have students get into cooperative groups of 2-3. Distribute one graphic organizer to each group and have students begin researching the origins of their pictographs, using the Internet and/or the library. 
</p>
<p class="underline">Day 2-</p>
<p class="text">Step 1:  Continue research.</p>
<p class="underline">Day 3-</p>
<p class="text">Step 1: Post the previous 3 questions again and read them aloud with students.</p>
<p class="text">Step 2: Explain that using these questions as a guide, students will make inferences from their research information to write a first-person essay about their pictograph, <em>writing in the voice of the artist</em>. Essays should be as detailed as possible and should include when and where the artist lived (based on the era and area of the pictograph being researched).</p>
<p class="text"><strong>Modification:</strong> Provide an essay outline for special needs students and give them predetermined Internet addresses to research. Have gifted/talented students research and report on an archeological rock art site not included in this lesson.</p>



 <p class="text"><strong>Closure:</strong> Ask the following: What technology and materials are available to artists today? How do they compare to the technology and materials used to create the rock art studied in this lesson?
  <p class="text"><strong> Student Product:</strong>
  <ul><li>Graphic organizer</li>
  <li>Rock art essay</li>
  </ul>  
  <p class="text"><strong>Assessment or evaluation:</strong>   Ask the following: If you were an artist, how would you ensure that your work would endure for 1,000 years?</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Extension Activity: </strong>For more on rock art, have students view the following Texas Beyond History websites:

	  <li>Using a wall map of the world, have a representative from each group point out where in the world their pictograph originated.</li>
	  <li>Using butcher paper, have students create a class timeline mural incorporating the pictograph dates from each group. Add information from each group’s research to their respective section of the timeline. Illustrate the timeline with pictographs from each group’s country and era.</li>
