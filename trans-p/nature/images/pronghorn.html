<h1><strong>Pronghorn Antelope </strong><strong>(<em>Antilocapra americana</em>)</strong></h1>
	<p>Like deer and desert bighorn sheep, pronghorn was a valued prey for the native peoples of the Trans-Pecos. These fleet, hooved creatures favor wide-open terrain where they can easily spot predators and make use of their best defense&mdash;their speed and sharp eyesight. Their natural curiosity for unknown objects, such as a waving piece of cloth, has been used by hunters, perhaps prehistoric as well as modern, to lure the animals closer for the kill.     
	<p>Pronghorn remains have been recovered from both lowland and upland prehistoric sites in the Trans-Pecos, as well as later mission sites.
    Antelope are also depicted in pictographs, such as a painted image at Hueco Tanks that is interpreted as representing a pronghorn mask.
