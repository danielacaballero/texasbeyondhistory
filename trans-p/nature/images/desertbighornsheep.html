<h1><strong>Desert Bighorn Sheep </strong><strong>(<em>Ovis canadensis nelsoni</em></strong><strong>)</strong></h1>
		<p>Desert bighorn sheep was a favored prey animal for the native peoples of the Trans-Pecos. They are not as well represented in the archeological record as deer and antelope, however, because of their limited range in the region. They are well-adapted to the dry conditions and steep rocky slopes of the mountains of the Trans-Pecos, and only reside here. Their remains have, therefore, only been recovered from upland sites and rockshelters in the mountains, such as Fresnal Shelter.
	    <p>Evidence of the importance of desert bighorn sheep to the native peoples of the Trans-Pecos resonates beyond the rocky mountain slopes, however, and can be seen in the rockart at <a href="../../images/ap4.html" target="_blank">Alamo Canyon</a> and <a href="../../../Hueco/index.html" target="_blank">Hueco Tanks</a>. There is also evidence that the horns of desert bighorn sheep were a popular trade item among the native peoples of the American Southwest. Hern&aacute;n Gallegos, chronicler of the 1581-1582 Rodr&iacute;guez/Chamuscado expedition, reported the discovery of an abandoned village north of La Junta that contained a very large cache of desert bighorn sheep horns meant for trade, each weighing an estimated 16 pounds.	</p>
