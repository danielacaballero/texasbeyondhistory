  <p> Aerial view of first few excavated rooms at Firecracker Pueblo (color has been enhanced to show structural footprint).  The compound consisted of 15 to 17 rooms in a one- to two-room-wide, linear room block. The walls were made of coursed adobe, while the floors were plastered caliche. The roofs were probably made of a combination of materials including wood, grass thatch, adobe, and mud plaster. Most rooms ranged in size from 8 to 20 square meters, had hearths near the center of the south wall, and possessed two primary postholes. The largest room was probably a communal room and had four primary postholes, two hearths and small pits along the north-south axis. This may have served as a gathering place, perhaps for ceremonies or rituals, much like kiva rooms in pueblos of the southwest. </p></td></tr>
