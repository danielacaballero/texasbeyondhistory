<p>Remains of El Paso polychrome vessels found at Firecracker Pueblo.  Pottery served a critical function in the village; it was needed for storage of water and food, for cooking, and to serve food on, among other uses. Although some pots were acquired through trade, the great majority was made at the pueblo using clay from nearby sources. Decorative designs were applied after the vessel was formed and dried in the sun, but before it was fired. Shown here are pieces from a large El Paso Polychrome jar, left, and a bowl found at Firecracker Pueblo.  They are painted in characteristic geometric designs in shades of red and black added over a brownish base coat.
