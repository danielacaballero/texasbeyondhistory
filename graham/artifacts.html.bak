            <p class="text">When the Austin phase people abandoned their rancheria, 
              they left behind thousands of artifacts, the tools and other objects 
              they made or collected while in residence there and lots of plain 
              old trash&#151;stone tool-making debris, spent hearth stones, and 
              organic waste. The artifacts they left behind were the things they 
              no longer wanted or needed or were too heavy to carry off with them. 
              Most of what they left can no longer be found in the ruins of the 
              rancheria. All the artifacts of wood, fiber, and leather which no 
              doubt littered the settlement, have long since disintegrated. Almost 
              all the bone, and perhaps most of the mussel shell as well, have 
              been destroyed by the processes of nature. We are left, to a large 
              extent, with just the artifacts made of stone to help us reconstruct 
              how these people lived.</p>
            <p class="text">By far, the most numerous stone artifacts recovered 
              were the waste flakes from stone tool making (debitage), many of 
              which were found in an area we describe as the lithic workshop area. 
              It seems possible that much of the tool making at the rancheria 
              took place in this area, away from the dwellings and cooking fires. 
              Of the actual tools, the vast majority are simple unmodified flint 
              flakes which would have been used for cutting or scraping and then 
              thrown away when dulled or no longer needed. More elaborate, carefully 
              shaped tools such as scrapers and bifaces had a longer use life 
              and have been recovered in very small numbers. Most of these &quot;formal&quot; 
              tools broke while being made or used and were discarded. Many were 
              reworked (resharpened or reshaped) to the point that they were no 
              longer useful. Occasionally a cherished and still useful item, such 
              as the expertly knapped arrow point preform excavated from a unit 
              north of the midden, was lost amid the camp refuse or high grass 
              around the site. Other items may have been left behind purposefully 
              with the thought that the group might return to this spot and reclaim 
              them during another visit. </p>
            <h3><a name="arrow" id="arrow"></a>Arrow Points</h3>
            <p class="text">Dozens of small, thin, chipped-stone points that once 
              tipped arrows have been recovered from the Graham-Applegate excavations. 
              All but two points are of the Scallorn type, one of the archeological 
              signatures of the central Texas Austin phase. From A.D. 700 to 1350, 
              these points were distributed throughout much of the state. </p>
            <p class="text"> Although classified as Scallorn, the Graham-Applegate 
              points vary slightly in shape or style. Some of these differences 
              result from the idiosyncrasies of the individual knapper, while 
              other style characteristics may have been developed and shared by 
              the culture through time. For example, the stems of the points from 
              Houses 1 and 2 are longer and narrower than the stems of later Scallorn 
              points. We also need to take into account that broken points were 
              often reworked into serviceable projectile tips or possibly other 
              tools. The two points that do not fit the Scallorn style likely 
              were made during the Austin phase as well. This includes the Sabinal 
              point more common to the Austin phase people who lived in the southern 
              and southwestern area of the Edwards Plateau, and another point 
              which is difficult to type, but may be a late variant of the Scallorn 
              type.</p>
           <h3><a name="arrow2"></a>Arrow Point Blanks and Preforms</h3>
            <p class="text">To make an arrow point, the knapper first struck off 
              a thin, flat flake or &quot;blank&quot; from a large chunk of flint 
              (core) or biface. The blank was then thinned further and shaped 
              by systematically applying pressure to the edges with an antler 
              tip to remove very small flakes from both faces of the blank, turning 
              it into an arrow point preform. The preform was further thinned 
              and shaped with pressure flaking, resulting in a very thin, symmetrical, 
              triangular point. The final step was to form notches by careful 
              pressure-flaking inward from the corners of the base, thus forming 
              barbs and creating an expanding stem for hafting on the arrow shaft. 
              Blanks and preforms from all stages of manufacture have been found 
              in Graham-Applegate. Most of these were recovered from the lithic 
              workshop area on the southern edge of the site, where the male hunters 
              likely sat and flaked stone tools (as conceptualized in the drawing, 
              above).</p>
            <h3><a name="dart"></a>Dart Points</h3>
            <p class="text"> A small number of dart points uncovered at the rancheria 
              are of styles that were in use hundreds and even thousands of years 
              before the Austin phase. One late Paleoindian point&#151;nearly 
              10,000-years old&#151;was found just outside of House 4. The presence 
              of these early points may mean that the site was occupied on brief 
              occasions during the Archaic period and earlier. It does not seem 
              that any of these early stays were long or &quot;intense&quot; because 
              in most cases only one example of each point type has been found. 
              A more likely explanation might be that the Austin phase inhabitants 
              collected these points from the older Archaic sites in the vicinity 
              of the rancheria, such as 41LL413 located a few hundred meters to 
              the west on the far side of the arroyo. We know that older artifacts, 
              such as certain bifaces, were brought into the rancheria and reworked 
              into new tools. In the process, flakes were removed that exposed 
              the unweathered flint beneath the old flaked surface that had developed 
              a patina.</p>
            <p class="text"> A more significant number of dart points recovered 
              from Graham-Applegate seem to belong to a single type, a type that 
              resembles the Late Archaic Darl point. These are long, slender points 
              with distinct shoulders but no barbs. They are relatively thick 
              and heavy and probably were not used to tip arrows. While it is 
              possible they were left behind during a Late Archaic occupation 
              of the area, it seems more likely&#151;based on their distribution 
              (and their depth in the site deposits)&#151;that they were part 
              of the Austin-phase use of the site. Both the &quot;Darl-like&quot; 
              points and Scallorn arrow points and preforms were found in and 
              just outside the floor of House 1. In other sites in central Texas, 
              both Scallorn points and Darl or Darl-like points have been found 
              together in contexts that strongly suggest they were in use at the 
              same time by the same cultural group. For example, at the Pat Parker 
              site near Austin, Scallorn points were found with Darl points in 
              burials. What this tells us is that Austin phase folk likely were 
              hunting with two types of weapons systems&#151;the bow and arrow 
              <em>and </em>the more-ancient spear thrower, or atlatl, which propelled 
              dart heads such as these (see <a href="arrow.html" class="text">From 
              Dart to Arrow</a>).</p>
          <h3> <a name="bifaces"></a>Bifaces </h3>
            <p class="text">&quot;Biface&quot; really has several meanings&#151;one 
              is simply any stone artifact where flakes have been removed from 
              both faces or sides. For example, almost all projectile points are 
              bifaces in this sense. A biface can also mean a type of knife-like, 
              general-purpose cutting tool with bifacial flaking. Austin phase 
              knappers made many small bifaces; some of these may actually be 
              dart point preforms or other unfinished tools. We know from the 
              flaking debris or debitage that some fairly large, thin bifaces 
              were also made at the rancheria, but no complete specimens have 
              been found. Undoubtedly, large bifacial knives were highly prized 
              possessions that were not discarded until broken.</p>
           <h3><a name="cores"></a>Cores </h3>
            <p class="text">Stone-tool making was a major endeavor at the rancheria, 
              and it is not surprising that many cores (blocky chunks of flint 
              from which flakes were removed) have been found there, especially 
              in the lithic workshop area on the south end of the site. The cores 
              began as river cobbles and gravels collected from the Llano River 
              and its terraces, and perhaps from sources farther away. These cobbles 
              were first tested where they were found by knocking off a few flakes 
              to reveal the quality of flint beneath the rough outer cortex. Cobbles 
              that passed the test were brought back to the rancheria and used 
              as cores, a ready source of flakes which could be used without further 
              modification as simple cutting tools. Some flakes would be further 
              fashioned into more formal tools such as scrapers. Sometimes cores 
              themselves could become &quot;heavy duty&quot; tools or &quot;choppers&quot; 
              when a suitable edge was flaked on them. There is little evidence 
              of this at the rancheria as only one core seems to have been used 
              as chopper. </p>
           <h3><a name="micro"></a>Micro-Cores</h3>
            <p class="text">Very small cores, or micro-cores, occur in significant 
              numbers at the rancheria. These present a puzzle because tiny flakes 
              were being struck from them, flakes too small to be used as arrow 
              point blanks. Perhaps the small flakes were used in groups to make 
              composite tools. For example, a series of small flakes could be 
              inserted into a groove along a wooden stick or piece of antler to 
              make a long-edged, serrated cutting tool. These small flakes also 
              could have been used singly in delicate cutting or scraping tasks.</p>
           <h3><a name="scrapers"></a>Scrapers</h3>
            <p class="text">These tools are not commonly found at many Austin 
              phase sites, and they are comparatively rare at the Graham-Applegate 
              rancheria. Less than half-a-dozen have come to light during the 
              excavations, which is unusual for such a useful and easily made 
              tool. It is possible that simple unworked flakes were used for scraping 
              tasks. Of the few scrapers that were found, several were large and 
              well-made and were found on the floors of Houses 2 and 3 and against 
              the outside wall of House 1.</p>
           <h3><a name="pebble"></a>Painted Pebble</h3>
            <p class="text">Painted pebbles are rarely seen at open campsites 
              because the paint usually is washed away by hundreds of years of 
              rainfalls. Remarkably, a painted pebble was found at Graham-Applegate 
              on the eastern side of the site near a hearth dated to the fourteenth 
              century A.D. The fact that the pebble was deposited in the ground 
              with the painted designs facing downward no doubt had something 
              to do with its preservation. Although the designs have faded and 
              are difficult to make out, they appear to consist of several wide 
              parallel lines in red paint on the smooth surface of a water-worn 
              sandstone cobble. Painted pebbles have been found in the Austin 
              phase occupation layer at Kyle Rockshelter in Hill County and at 
              Scorpion Cave in Medina County (which has a substantial Austin phase 
              component). Painted pebbles are fairly common finds in rockshelters 
              and other protected areas of the Lower Pecos region (see <a href="../bonfire/pebble.html" class="text">The 
              Painted Pebble Cache</a> in the Bonfire exhibit for more discussion).</p>
           <h3><a name="tools"></a>Groundstone Tools</h3>
            <p class="text">Groundstone tools made by grinding, battering, and 
              pecking have been found in all parts of the Graham-Applegate site. 
              These include whole and fragmentary granite manos (hand stones) 
              and sandstone metate (slabs with grinding facets) fragments. Most 
              if not all of these artifacts were recycled as heating stones in 
              the large central hearths of the houses and the smaller outdoor 
              hearths or fireplaces. Many highly burned fragments of groundstone 
              artifacts also were recovered from the burned rock midden and undoubtedly 
              were used to line the baking pit. A large metate fragment and several 
              manos had been used in the wall supports of House 1. Normally used 
              for grinding seeds into flour, manos and metates from Graham-Applegate 
              have not been found in any context that would lead us to conclude 
              they were being used there to process food. Even the few serviceable 
              manos that were not recovered from burned rock features or from 
              wall supports showed evidence of having been burned. One perfectly 
              good mano was even recovered from the bottom of the central hearth 
              in House 1. It seems as though the inhabitants of the rancheria 
              had little need for such implements and were probably consuming 
              foods that did not require grinding. Alternatively, they may have 
              taken the still serviceable milling stones with them. The rancheria 
              people might have picked up these grinding stones from old Archaic 
              campgrounds in the area where even today such artifacts are fairly 
              common. </p>
           <h3><a name="stone"></a>Grooved stone </h3>
            <p class="text">An unexpected find was an egg-shaped piece of sandstone 
              with a shallow groove pecked lengthwise around it. Similar grooved 
              stones, along with the notched stones called &quot;Waco sinkers,&quot; 
              have been dated to Late PaleoIndian and Early Archaic times, thousands 
              of years before the rancheria existed. Like the early dart points, 
              this grooved stone could be something that was found elsewhere and 
              brought back to the settlement as a curiosity.</p>
