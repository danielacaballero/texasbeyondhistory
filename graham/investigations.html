            <p class="text">Before excavations began at the Graham-Applegate site 
              in the summer of 1998, there was little evidence that the remains 
              of a prehistoric encampment were buried only a few inches beneath 
              the ground surface. A year earlier, the Llano Uplift Archeological 
              Society had conducted a survey of the area at the request of the 
              landowner, Charlotte Graham, and found only a few flint flakes. 
              Since the soils at the site are shallow, it was felt at the time 
              that if anything of archeological significance existed there, more 
              artifacts or features would be visible on the surface. Reinforcing 
              the idea that little would be found there was the fact that no permanent 
              water flows in the immediate area today. The closest reliable source 
              of water is the Llano River, a half-mile to the west over rough 
              terrain. </p>
            <p class="text">Early in 1998, the chance discovery by Ms. Graham 
              of a half-dozen flint arrow points protruding from the backdirt 
              piles of gopher holes provided the first real hints that something 
              archeologically important might be buried there. All the arrow points 
              were of the same type or &quot;style&quot; suggesting that only 
              a single cultural group may have camped there. If so, it seemed 
              the site could well be a time capsule containing information about 
              life in central Texas at a particular period in the prehistoric 
              past. In this case, the style of point was known to have been used 
              between A.D. 700 and A.D. 1350, during what archeologists call the 
              Austin Phase. </p>
            <p class="text">Recognizing the site's potential importance, the Llano 
              Uplift Archeological Society (LUAS) made the decision to undertake 
              investigations at the site. Initially, the research plan was to 
              excavate large areas where the arrow points were found and where 
              it seemed the most intensive activity took place in prehistoric 
              times. Our hope was that living surfaces would be exposed, perhaps 
              even the remains of shelters or areas where specific activities, 
              stone-tool making for example, took place. The shallow soils were 
              ideal for a broad horizontal excavation (opening up large areas) 
              since the hoped-for living surface could be reached quickly. At 
              sites with deep archeological deposits, such as those on river terraces, 
              excavated areas often are small due to the large volume of soil 
              that must be removed. At the beginning of the investigations, we 
              also hoped to recover a discrete (unmixed) assemblage of the kinds 
              of stone tools used by people during the Austin phase. Few open 
              campsites of this period have been investigated that do not also 
              contain artifacts from earlier and later aboriginal cultures, mixed 
              in with those of the Austin phase.</p>
            <p class="text"> A 4-x-6-meter (16.7-x-20-foot) area was initially 
              excavated down to a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches), revealing 
              two small hearths to one side of an extensive refuse scatter of 
              burned rock, mussel shells, and stone tools. Large numbers of flint 
              flakes, along with cores and unfinished bifaces indicated that stone-tool 
              making took place there. Three obsidian flakes also were found in 
              this &quot;lithic workshop&quot; area. In the fall of 1998, LUAS 
              obtained permission to do test excavations of the adjacent Applegate 
              property that lies immediately to the north of where we were working. 
              It was assumed at the time that the remains of the Austin phase 
              occupation continued onto this property, although almost no artifacts 
              were noticed in the gopher mounds that also dotted the surface of 
              the Applegate land.</p>
			<h3><a name="midden"></a>Hidden Midden Exposed</h3>
            <p class="text">At this point, we wanted to know not only how far 
              the site extended to the north, but also the nature of the aboriginal 
              occupation there: Would we still find the same kinds of artifacts 
              and features? Would they date to the Austin phase or was this area 
              occupied by earlier or later cultures? A series of 1-x-2-meter ( 
              3.3-x-6.7-foot) test pits was excavated at widely spaced intervals 
              to the north and then to the east and west on the Applegate property 
              in an attempt to answer these questions. These excavations showed 
              that the Austin phase occupation continued at least 50 meters (167 
              feet) to the north with scattered hearths and stone tools although 
              the amount of flint chipping debris decreased considerably. One 
              of the test pits near the edge of a deeply cut arroyo that borders 
              the west side of the site revealed what was at first thought to 
              be an unusually large and elongated stone hearth. To better record 
              this feature, adjacent units were excavated, and to our surprise, 
              other stone features began to emerge. Only after an 2-x-5-meter 
              (6.7-x-13.4-foot) area was opened up, however, did it become apparent 
              that these rock features were related. Collectively they appeared to form 
              the walls and central hearth of a large circular structure that 
              was eventually designated &quot;House 1.&quot; The finding of an apparent house 
              was big news&#151;it had been several decades since the last house 
              remains had been found in central Texas. Archeologists from the 
              Lower Colorado River Authority, TARL, and the Texas Historical Commission 
              visited the site and offered opinions and encouragement.</p>
            <p class="text">With the discovery and excavation of the first &quot;house,&quot; 
              our research plan was changed to actively seek out additional house-like features at the site. Since there were no clues on the surface to lead us 
              to them, the only sure way of finding similar features was to cover as 
              much of the site as possible with test units. This strategy initially 
              failed to find additional &quot;houses&quot; but did lead to the discovery of 
              a burned rock midden. Typically, burned rock middens are conspicuous 
              features littered with fire-cracked rocks and often forming an obvious 
              mound. But we only became aware of the one at Graham/Applegate through 
              a randomly placed test pit which revealed an area of tightly packed, 
              burned granite rocks with dark, charcoal-stained soil only inches 
              below the surface. The midden had been all but invisible since it 
              blended with the natural contours of the land and was hidden by 
              dense brush and leaf litter near the edge of the arroyo only 15 
              m (50 ft) south of House 1. </p>
            <p class="text">Over the next several months, the thin layer of soil 
              and fallen leaves was carefully stripped away to expose the surface 
              of the midden. It consisted of a low circular mound of burned granite 
              rocks with a center of dark, charcoal-stained soil, presumably where 
              the earth oven or ovens were located. The soils in the site area 
              are a light tan color with little organic material, and the dark 
              staining in the midden stands out very clearly (see <a href="images/LL419-GS8.html" class="text">photo 
              of soil samples</a>). A meter-wide trench was hand excavated down 
              the middle of the midden to get a cross-section of the central oven 
              and to locate the oven feature. Unfortunately, the trench missed 
              the oven, which probably lies just to the west where large boulders 
              are protruding from the surface. As one might expect for an area 
              devoted to cooking, few stone tools or flakes were recovered from 
              the midden excavations, but many food items were, including mussel 
              shells, bone, and charred plant material. </p>
            <h3><a name="houses"></a>Probing for  &quot;Houses 2 and 3&quot; </h3>
            <p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Since this exhibit was written, a more recent interpretation indicates the features first thought to be the remains of houses were more likely burned rock middens (see the New Interpretation section).</em> </p>
            <p class="text">After the midden excavations, it was realized that 
              it would take far too much time to adequately cover the site with 
              test pits in order to find additional &quot;houses.&quot; We then began systematically 
              probing the ground with thin metal rods to locate subsurface stone 
              features. This was possible only after a rain had softened the ground, 
              otherwise the sun-baked earth was much too hard for this technique. 
              This approach was very successful and directly led to the discovery 
              of possible Houses 2 and 3, both of which were missed by earlier test pits 
              nearby. &quot;House 4&quot; also was discovered by probing, although before 
              excavation it was initially thought to be a small cooking hearth. 
              Bedrock near the surface along the north side of the site hampered 
              the probing, and &quot;House 5&quot; was discovered more or less accidentally 
              while excavating the area immediately to the north of &quot;House 4.&quot; </p>
            <p class="text"> &quot;Houses 3, 4, and 5&quot; all lay within the same 
              excavation block and exhibited similar construction details&#151; 
              what appeared to be triangular hearths, for example&#151;and were probably built at 
              the same time. Of interest here is a long, narrow, pile of quartz 
              cobbles that connects &quot;Houses 3 and 4,&quot; put there by the prehistoric 
              inhabitants for some unknown reason. During the excavation of the 
              block, evidence of a more-recent occupation was identified above, 
              or on top of, the floor surfaces of the three presumed houses. One small 
              cooking hearth and a small, rock-lined pit were apparently built 
              on and in the shallow soils that developed over the &quot;house&quot; foundations 
              after the site had been abandoned by the earlier people. A radiocarbon 
              date from the small hearth places this later occupation some time 
              between about A.D. 1000 to 1200.</p>
            <p class="text"> The Llano Uplift Archeological Society enjoyed what 
              few professional archeologists today have, the luxury of time. While 
              most government-mandated digs are done under intense time pressures 
              in advance of bulldozers and development, excavations at Graham-Applegate 
              were carried out over a three-year period (and still counting). 
              As a result, few sites in central Texas have been as extensively 
              excavated as Graham-Applegate. Even so, much still needs to be done 
              to understand fully what was going on there centuries ago. With 
              this site, we can learn how prehistoric encampments were organized 
              and document the kinds of activities that took place there.  Much will be learned, too, during the analysis phase 
              of the project when the artifacts are scrutinized and other special 
              technical studies carried out. We already know we are dealing with 
              at least three different periods of occupations of the site, all 
              by people of the Austin phase culture. The earliest known stay happened 
              around A.D. 1000 when the rancheria was built. A second visit occurred 
              probably less than a century later, and includes the hearth and 
              rock-lined pit above &quot;House 3.&quot; A final visit happened sometime in 
              the 1300s, as revealed by a radiocarbon date from the &quot;hearth 
              that disappeared.&quot;</p>
           <h3><a name="hearth"></a>The Hearth that Disappeared</h3>
            <p class="text">Although the location of the Graham/Applegate site 
              is not a well-kept secret, we have been very fortunate that little 
              vandalism has occurred in the three years of excavations. A few 
              pieces of equipment were stolen early on, the most valuable being 
              a large ladder. For some reason, a long metal bar used for measuring 
              was also taken, even though it would be of little use to anyone. 
              By far the most unusual thing that disappeared was a stone hearth 
              that had been uncovered on the eastern edge of the site. The hearth 
              was discovered during excavation of a test unit along a fence on 
              the eastern border of the site. Long before the level of the top 
              of the hearth was reached, a distinct circular area of carbon staining 
              was encountered. Eventually, a small but well-constructed stone 
              hearth was uncovered. Several charcoal samples were taken from between 
              and beneath the hearth stones. Radiocarbon assays on one of the 
              samples established an age range of between A.D. 1285 and 1405 for 
              the charred wood, a time which postdates by several centuries that 
              of the rancheria. Nonetheless, the arrow points around this hearth 
              were of the Scallorn type. It appears that this hearth represents 
              a very late occupation by Austin phase people. </p>
            <p class="text">Because the hearth was so well preserved, we carefully 
              reburied it for later archeomagnetic studies which would help us 
              understand how it was used. Several months later, we reexcavated 
              the unit only to find that the hearth was gone&#151;no trace of 
              it could be seen. We can only presume that someone dug it up thinking 
              something valuable was buried beneath it; when nothing was found, 
              the rocks must have been tossed away and the pit reburied to hide 
              the vandalism.</p>
            <p class="text"> Because the hearth had vanished, we were forced to 
              select another hearth feature for archeomagnetic studies. We chose 
              another small hearth already uncovered near House 1. Small cores 
              were removed from the rocks and taken to the Geology Department 
              at the University of Texas in Austin for testing of the magnetic 
              properties of the samples. </p>
            <p class="text">Archeomagnetic tests can estimate the temperature 
              at which the rocks were heated and if the rocks were moved after 
              they cooled. The stones in this hearth had been heated to around 
              300 degrees C (600 degrees F.), a typical temperature for these 
              kinds of features, and they had lain undisturbed during the many 
              centuries since it had been used. </p>
