            <p class="text">In the rolling granite hills near the confluence of 
              the Llano and Colorado Rivers, the remains of a thousand-year-old 
              Indian village, or <em>rancheria</em>, have come to light 
              through excavations by the Llano Uplift Archeological Society. 
              Named Graham-Applegate after the present-day landowners, the site 
              offers a  glimpse into the lives of a little-known Indian people 
              who called central Texas home at the turn of the first millennium 
              A.D. Their culture vanished&#151;or blended with that of later groups&#151;several 
              centuries before the earliest Spanish expeditions entered the region. 
              No written account exists that could tell us who these people were, 
              what language they spoke, or even what they called themselves. Archeologists 
              refer to the culture of these people, and the time in which they 
              lived, as the Austin phase. </p>
            <p class="text">Earlier research has shown that the Austin phase was 
              a time of tumultuous change for the people of central Texas. The 
              period began around A.D. 700 with the introduction of the bow and 
              arrow which supplemented, and eventually replaced, the atlatl and 
              dart, an older weapon system which had been in use for thousands 
              of years. The new weapon system&#151;lighter, more deadly accurate, 
              and easier to use in cramped quarters&#151;undoubtedly disrupted 
              the existing order already tense from population pressures, and 
              probably initiated an era of violence reflected in the appearance 
              of the first formal cemeteries in the region. Many of the individuals 
              buried in these cemeteries died from arrow wounds, the evidence 
              being corner-notched flint arrow points&#151;of a type called &quot;Scallorn&quot; 
              by archeologists&#151; found embedded in and among their bones. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The excavations at Graham-Applegate paint a somewhat 
              different, more peaceful picture of Austin phase times. Situated 
              on the lower reaches of a gentle slope, the rancheria is not well-positioned 
              for defense. Judging from the features excavated there, the living areas and work areas are not all in close proximity to one another and may not 
              even have been occupied at the same time. . </p>
            <p class="text">Much time also was spent on the search for food and 
              in its preparation within the rancheria. The ruins of a large earth 
              oven once lined with granite boulders attests to the importance 
              of plant foods for these people; perhaps they were baking large 
              quantities of wild onions, a plant which still grows today in nearby 
              arroyos in early spring. Granite was also used to construct smaller 
              hearth-like grills for cooking freshwater mussels and other foods 
              gathered or hunted from the wild. Numerous other cooking features have been uncovered as well. </p>
            <p class="text">There is no evidence that these 
              people ever practiced agriculture. Stone-tool making was an important 
              endeavor at the rancheria. Most of the tools, such as arrow points 
              and knives, were made of chert (flint) but at least one inhabitant 
              was in possession of a tool made from volcanic glass or obsidian, 
              an exotic material for these parts. Three obsidian flakes recovered 
              from a lithic workshop area have been tentatively traced, using 
              their chemical signature, to an outcrop in southwestern Utah over 
              a thousand miles from the Graham-Applegate site.            </p>
            <p class="text">In our early interpretation of the site, it was thought that the stone features  at Graham-Applegate were the remains of houses. The stone circles and pavements appeared to represent 
              the foundations and floors of five hut-like structures swallowed 
              up by the gravel-filled soils soon after they were abandoned by 
              their owners. Prehistoric architectural features are rarely found 
              (or, more accurately, recognized) in central Texas. Prior to the 
              investigations at Graham-Applegate, only four prehistoric houses 
              had been excavated in this region, so those at Graham-Applegate 
              would more than double that number. Similar stone circles found in relatively 
              large numbers along the eroding shorelines of area reservoirs are 
              a reminder that many such features may lie buried, archeologically invisible 
              until a chance discovery unveils them. </p>

           <p class="text">From the late sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, 
              Spanish expeditions traveling north into Coahuila and Texas from 
              central Mexico frequently encountered Indian settlements which they 
              called <em>rancherias</em>. From the Spanish word <em>rancho</em>, with 
              various meanings including hut or farm, rancheria implies a temporary 
              settlement where the inhabitants lived in modestly constructed houses. 
              A rancheria represents something more than a mere campsite, but 
              less than a permanent village or pueblo. Archeologists have appropriated 
              this word to refer to hunter-gatherer campsites such as Graham-Applegate 
              that appear to contain traces of aboriginal dwellings.</p>
            <p class="text">Only one definite rancheria 
              has been excavated in central Texas. The Lion Creek site, located 
              less than10 miles (16 kms) from Graham-Applegate on the eastern 
              shore of Lake Buchanan in Burnet County, was excavated by the Texas 
              Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in the late 1970s. There, the 
              buried foundation remains of two houses and a third possible house 
              were discovered and uncovered. One of the houses dated to the Austin 
              phase and was probably occupied about the same time as the Graham-Applegate 
              rancheria. The other two stone patterns, or &quot;features,&quot; 
              are earlier, apparently dating to the early part of the Late Archaic 
              (based on the styles of projectile points found with them). </p>
            <p class="text">A possible rancheria site was also excavated by TxDOT 
              in 1980 only a mile (1.6 km) north of Graham-Applegate at a low-water 
              crossing of the Llano River known as the &quot;Slab.&quot; Unlike 
              Graham-Applegate, the Slab site was visited by aboriginal peoples 
              at many different times in the past, resulting in a complex living 
              surface cluttered with many stone patterns. Most of these features, 
              as depicted in drawings in the report, look like the small cooking 
              hearths or fireplaces scattered about the Graham-Applegate rancheria. 
              A few larger stone features could be central hearths but lack well-defined 
              wall areas.</p>
            <h3 class="text">Update: New Interpretations</h3>
            <p class="text">In our <strong><a href="new-interpretations.html">New Interpretations </a></strong>section, we consider an alternative view of the Graham-Applegate site based on data gleaned after this exhibit was originally written. The stone features at the site have now been identified as burned rock middens. We include both interpretations in this exhibit to show how archeological determinations are made, and the proccesses and techniques involved in those considerations. That the Graham-Applegate site reflects a campsite, or rancheria, is not in question. Clearly, Late Prehistoric peoples spent much time at the site in the labor intensive tasks of processing and cooking plant food in earthen ovens, as evidenced by the multiple burned rock middens. However,  evidence of the ephemeral brush huts likely used by prehistoric campers apparently is lacking, and  finding such remains continues to be a quest for many archeologists. </p>
