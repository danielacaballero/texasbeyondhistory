  <tr>
    <td width="480"><p>The <em>Graham-Applegate Rancheria</em> exhibit was written in 2001 while fieldwork was  still in progress; since that time, our interpretation of the circular stone  features has radically changed. Initially thought to be the remains of hut-like  houses based on earlier interpretations of similar circular features found in  the Lake Buchanan area, by the last year of fieldwork we began to see the stone  circles as baking pits (also known as earth ovens), a rather common feature at  prehistoric sites across central Texas (see the <a href="../honey/index.html" target="_blank">Honey Creek</a>, <a href="../bowie/index.html" target="_blank">Camp Bowie</a>   exhibits on TBH, also, &ldquo;<a href="cooking.html" target="_blank">Cooking with Granite&rdquo;</a> in this exhibit). Obviously baking pits in  no way resemble houses, so how was there ever any confusion? The following  paragraphs will attempt to explain the process of this reinterpretation. </p>
      <p>Soon after Curtis Tunnell of  the Texas Memorial Museum first saw the circular features on the Lake Buchanan  shoreline in 1962, he wrote a short article in the museum newsletter referring  to them as an archeological &ldquo;mystery.&rdquo; His best explanation was that each  feature represented a peculiar arrangement of stone hearths but grouped so  close together that they would burn anyone who sat near them. A short time  later, he took UT professor E. Mott Davis to see them. To Davis, the features  resembled archeological examples of house floors with a central hearth  surrounded by wall remains. He was aware of the small living space within these  would-be structures and speculated that the circles might be sweat lodges. Both  archeologists saw the same features but came up with totally different  interpretations.</p>
      <p>Archeologists often encounter  objects from the past that defy easy explanation. This is not only because the  archeological record is usually incomplete because of the impacts of decay and destruction over  time, but also because archeologists are often investigating cultures radically  different than their own, belonging to people who behaved and thought quite  differently than we do. Interpreting the archeological record &#8212; to translate it  into past human behavior and actions&#8212;is a critical part of archeology. With  knowledge of what people were doing in the past, larger theoretical questions,  such as the adoption of agriculture for example, can then be addressed. Just knowing  what the circular features were used for, whether as houses or earth ovens,  would be interesting but at the same time trivial. We already are fairly  certain that some sort of dwelling was used at most occupation sites, and ovens  are commonly reported at prehistoric sites in central Texas. But if the  Graham/Applegate circular features are revealed to be earth ovens, then they  might be able to tell us about subsistence practices and ultimately why hunting  and gathering persisted in central Texas long after adjacent regions turned to  agriculture. Conversely, if they are houses we might be able to make meaningful  statements about household size, band size, and other aspect of social  organization within the context of a small Late Prehistoric encampment.</p>
      <p>Archeologist and philosopher Alison  Wylie has pointed out that most archeological interpretation is based on analogical  reasoning. This basically means that a researcher will look for similarities between  the archeological remains and some known examples from his or her experience that  can be used to understand and &ldquo;fill out&rdquo; the archeological record. Using  analogies is how we make sense of our world; we would otherwise be in a  constant state of bewilderment not recognizing anything around us. Both Tunnell  and Davis were using analogies to explain the stone circles they saw on the  Lake Buchanan shoreline, but they came up with different interpretations;  Curtis saw a group of hearths and Davis a house or sweat lodge. They cannot be both  right, and one problem with analogical reasoning&#8212; comparing the past with the  present&#8212;is that multiple interpretations are often possible. Many  archeologists beginning in the 1960s and even earlier rejected the use of  analogies to understand the past because this type of reasoning is often unreliable  and known to lead to false conclusions. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        For   a simple example, many artifact collectors believe that all   chipped-stone projectile points they find are arrowheads because they   resemble modern day examples in&nbsp;shape and size. Even trained   archeologists may initially interpret small projectile points as arrow   points.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;such points   are in some cases actually dart points. Although the perishable   portions of these weapons (eg., the wooden shafts) are rarely   preserved, several intact specimens from <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/ceremonial/hafted.html" target="_blank">Ceremonial Cav</a>e in the arid   Trans-Pecos region, provide prime examples of how this technology   functioned.&nbsp; In this case, the small projectiles were not hafted to   arrow shafts but instead to thick, short, wooden sticks,&nbsp;and they functioned   as dart points propelled by an atlatl or throwing stick, rather than a   bow.&nbsp; By the same token, what   some collectors call "bird points" are indeed arrow points as is also   verified by examples found in rockshelters still hafted to their wooden   arrow shafts. <br>
      <em><u><br>
      </u></em> Wylie recognized that we are  mostly stuck with analogies to make sense of the past, and the best approach is  to use them correctly by considering the relevance of the similarities, and addressing  the negative aspects of analogies&#8212; those things that really don&rsquo;t fit between  the archeological objects and the modern examples or analogs they resemble.</p>
<p>It was the selection of only positive  analogies that led to the house interpretation. The circular features do in  fact look like house floors seen both archeologically and ethnographically  across the world, with a central hearth surrounded by what looks like traces of  wall foundations. It just so happens that all reported examples in central  Texas fall within the size range for hunter-gatherer houses, and the circular outline  of the house is typical for mobile hunter-gatherers. But there are also negative  analogies.</p>
      <p>Davis immediately saw that the  central hearth was disproportionately large for the size of the house, hence  his sweat lodge hypothesis. Sometimes negative analogies can be explained away. Archeologist Lee Johnson, in writing up the report on the Lion Creek site where similar  stone circles were uncovered in the 1970s, made an analogy between the Lion  Creek central hearths and the hearths in Anglo-Saxon houses, which constitute  more of a stone platform or work table with a small fire in the center. The  relevance of such an analogy can be questioned since the Anglo-Saxon  environment and economy were very different from those of the central Texas Late  Prehistoric, but Johnson&rsquo;s interpretation does offer a way out of the problem  of the disproportionally large hearth.</p>
      <p>If Johnson&rsquo;s interpretation  for the central hearths is correct, then we would expect only the central area  of the hearth to show signs of fire exposure. Visually, the surfaces of the  Graham-Applegate hearths appear uniform with no obvious charcoal staining or  other signs of fire. To find supporting evidence for Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;workbench&rdquo;  hypothesis, we asked University of Texas geologist Wulf Gose to analyze the  magnetic properties of the rocks in three of the circular feature hearths. This  analysis can reveal if a burned rock remained in place after its last heating,  and often the maximum temperature the rock was heated to. If Johnson&rsquo;s  hypothesis is correct, then we&rsquo;d expect the rocks along the periphery of the  central hearth &ndash; the area used as a workbench - to have been exposed to much  lower temperatures than the rocks in the center of the pavement where a fire  would have been burning. Gose for the most part found that all the tested rocks in the  hearths had been heated to red-hot temperatures of over 500 degrees Celsius  (930 degrees F), and that they&rsquo;d remained mostly in place since then. These are  temperatures we would expect for rocks used in earth ovens, not inside huts  covered with flammable materials.</p>
      <p>Another negative aspect that&rsquo;s  more difficult to explain is the presence of small features at Graham-Applegate  with the same basic pattern as the large circular features. For example, Feature  56 has a central hearth and is surrounded by satellite clusters, but the entire  feature is only 190 cm (6 feet 3 inches) across. A bit too small to be a house,  it otherwise resembles the larger features.</p>
      <p>So far, it appears that the  Graham-Applegate circular features have more in common with oven-type features  than aboriginal houses. If the central hearths lacked satellite rock clusters,  then there would be no question that they are, as archeologist Steve Black would say,  heating elements of a earth oven (see <a href="../honey/index.html" target="_blank">Honey Creek</a> exhibit). So what are the  satellite clusters? Could they have <em>actually</em> been used somehow to stabilize house walls or are they something else entirely? </p>
      <p>The relevance of the wall  support aspect of the analogy can also be called into question. At Lion Creek,  Johnson speculated that the satellite clusters were used to help stabilize wall  posts in the loose, sandy soil. At Turkey Creek Ranch in Concho County, another  site with a similar circular feature, the investigators could see open spaces  within the satellite clusters where they speculated wall posts could have gone.  In this instance, the rocks appear to have been stacked on the surface around  the posts to provide support. The spaces measured from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10  inches) across, indicating the post diameter. If this interpretation is correct,  the largest of the inferred posts would probably weigh more than the rocks  supporting it, and in any case all inferred posts would be so heavy that no  supporting rocks would be necessary, especially with the added weight of the material&#8212;hide, mat, or grass&#8212; used to cover the hut. </p>
      <p>Ethnographically, rocks where  more often used to hold down the covering to keep it from flapping in the wind  and to keep cold air from entering the base of the structure. The rocks were  usually large and heavy enough to do the job, but at Graham-Applegate the rocks  making up the wall supports are for the most part small. For the circular feature we  were calling House 1, the average weight of a satellite rock is 430 grams (less  than one pound). Piled up in fairly large  numbers, such rocks could work in holding down the covering, but it would still  make more sense to use fewer, heavier rocks. Large rocks are readily available  in the Graham-Applegate area.</p>
      <p>Once uncovered, we could see  that many of the wall support rocks had fractured as if by heat. This was borne  out by Gose&rsquo;s analysis of the magnetism in a sample of the &ldquo;wall supports&rdquo; rocks  of &ldquo;House 2&rdquo; that showed they had been subjected to high heat. His analysis  also indicated that the rocks had been heated repeatedly in different  positions. Gose sampled mainly the larger wall support rocks, but many rocks in  these satellite clusters are small and of a size similar to rocks found in the  burned rock middens. Midden rocks are now generally accepted to be cleanouts of  heat-fractured rocks from earth ovens. Taking  into account the complex heating history of the rocks in the satellite clusters  and their high temperatures and fracturing, they resemble oven cleanouts more  than rocks that would be used to support hut walls. What we seem have then in  these satellite clusters is the beginning of burned rock middens, but such an  interpretation is actually nothing new. Nearly forty years ago, Texas Highway archeologists  uncovered satellite rock clusters around certain baking pits in Musk Hog Canyon  in Crockett County, which Clive Luke interpreted as the &ldquo;outcasts from a  previous use of the central pit/hearth.&rdquo; In this case, there was virtually no  rock-free space between the oven and satellite clusters, so there was little  resemblance to house floors.</p>
      <p>We still need to explain why  the cleanout piles&#8212;what we were calling wall supports&#8212;are distributed more or less evenly around  the oven with a rock-free space in between. At the Honey Creek site, cleanout  piles were identified spread out to one side of the oven pit, which would seem  an easier way to go about depositing waste rocks. However, observations made by  archeologist Lewis Binford about how people, and hunter-gatherers in particular,  organize their workspace offers an explanation for this pattern.</p>
      <p>Binford spent much of his mid career  in what he called &ldquo;actualistic&rdquo; studies, living with hunter-gatherers and documenting  the types of trash they left behind during specific activities. He was  particularly interested in the patterns this trash left on the ground. These  patterns, he felt, could be used to help &ldquo;translate&rdquo; similar patterns seen at archeological  sites into past human behavior. Binford argued that many activities conducted  by totally different societies produce the same basic trash patterns because  human behavior is in certain ways constrained by their anatomy. His approach  has been criticized by other archeologists, especially Ian Hodder, who  emphasizes context and the influence of cultural and social attitudes in  forming the archeological record. But one particular idea of Binford&rsquo;s concerning  artifact patterns that result from human activities performed while <em>standing</em>, as opposed to <em>sitting</em>, may help explain the ring of  rock clusters surrounding oven features (see <a href="../mckinney/darl.html" target="_blank">McKinney  Roughs</a> exhibit for an example of artifact patterns resulting from  activities performed while sitting).</p>
      <p>Binford noted a regularity in the  pattern in debris which resulted from work activities that where conducted  while standing, which he referred to as the &ldquo;classic feature-centered  pattern.&rdquo;&nbsp; The center area would be the  focus of the activity&#8212;Binford&rsquo;s actualistic observations included an Australian  Aborigine roasting pit and a Ninamuit Eskimo caribou carcass&#8212;surrounded by an  empty space so workers could walk around the task area. Beyond this open area  would be an outer zone where material was discarded and out of the way. </p>
      <p>A similar pattern can be seen  in the circular features at Graham-Applegate: the central work area is the  earth oven, with an open space around for workers to walk around it and an  outer zone of discarded rocks. Of course as was mentioned earlier, the people  could just as well have tossed the rocks to one side, and earth oven experiments  conducted by archeologists don&rsquo;t necessarily produce this circular pattern of  waste material, but people who have to cook in earth ovens on a regular basis  would tend to do it in the most economical fashion, as Binford observed,  especially if they planned to reuse the oven pit. But there could be more to  this empty space than just an open path around a task area.</p>
      <p>The rock-free space around the  oven may also have had another purpose: to store the dirt needed to seal in the  heat and moisture once cooking commences. A lot of dirt is needed to create  this seal, and if inadequate, could result in the food being burned after all  moisture escapes. The pattern of rocks seen in the outer ring of &ldquo;House 1&rdquo; at  Graham-Applegate could result from rocks discarded on the outer slope of a circular  berm or mound of earth. Such a berm would form when the earth seal is scraped  away from the oven to the outer margins to expose the cooked food. A berm would  be difficult to discern during conventional archeological excavation, but at  least one example of an earth oven with a possible berm has been recorded. On  Double Horn Creek in Burnet County, the creek channel has bisected an earth  oven buried in terrace sediments, providing a near-perfect cross-section of the  feature. The profile shows a concave pit outlined by rocks and charcoal, and,  importantly, with what appears to be mounded earth taking the form of  lighter-colored sediments outside the pit. </p>
      <p>We can speculate that the  Graham-Applegate circular features once resembled the Double Horn oven, being shallow  pits lined with rocks and charred wood. Because of the environmental conditions  at Graham-Applegate, over time these features have transformed into nearly flat  rock pavements with only traces of their organic materials remaining. </p>
      <p>Much data were collected during  the Graham-Applegate excavations, and only a small amount is presented here.  There is no way to definitely say that the circular features are <em>not</em> houses&#8212;that kind of certainty is usually  not found in archeology&#8212;or that these features represent only one thing. It&rsquo;s  possible that the same basic pattern could have been produced by very different  activities and behaviors, but the oven hypothesis does seem the most plausible,  and viewing these features as ovens allows us to ask a whole new set of questions  dealing with burned rock midden formation. </p>
