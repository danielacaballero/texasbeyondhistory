           <p class="text">By Susan Dial</p>
            <p class="text">One story that remains to be told about the Graham-Applegate 
              site is what has gone on behind the scenes&#151;how an all-volunteer 
              crew of archeological novices has been led week after week by a 
              quiet young archeologist to uncover a 1000-year-old village. In 
              some ways, their story is just as remarkable as that of the rancheria, 
              for it has taken determination and an unusual blending of personalities 
              to continue the project in the face of sparse funds, bad weather, 
              and dwindling numbers in the crew. Of the three dedicated <a href="http://www.texasluas.org/" target="_blank">Llano 
              Archeological Society</a> (LUAS) members who have seen the project through 
              from day one, each credits the others with a large measure of the 
              success.</p>
            <h3>Chuck Hixson: &quot;The Perfect Teacher&quot;</h3>
            <p class="text">The quiet but steady force behind the Graham-Applegate 
              project is Chuck Hixson, an archeologist trained in the southwest 
              but knowledgeable about the idiosyncrasies of central Texas prehistory. 
              While attaining his B.A. and M.A.degrees in anthropology at the 
              University of Texas at Austin, Hixson developed a keen interest 
              in southwestern pottery-making technology that developed into a 
              thesis project (his topic was a study of the paint on Mogollon Black-on-White 
              pottery). Today, he has transformed his technical knowledge into 
              an art. Using open firing pits and aboriginal techniques, Hixson 
              produces exquisitely thin-walled, bone-tempered vessels from clays 
              he has collected from throughout the local area. His 
              vessels provide a startlingly graphic 
              example of the artistic capabilities of the Late Prehistoric peoples 
              in Texas. He also reproduces prehistoric Southwestern pottery of 
              several different styles, including the fine Mimbres Black-on-White. 
              <br>
              <br>
              At the site, landowner and LUAS member Charlotte Graham credits 
              the mild-mannered archeologist with keeping them motivated for the 
              twice-weekly digs which have somehow stretched over a three-year-period, 
              through torrential rains and searing heat. &quot;He's the perfect 
              teacher,&quot; she says. &quot;He doesn't beat us down or make us 
              feel stupid.&quot; Hixson's habit of producing frequent, detailed, 
              electronic site maps has served to bring into sharp focus the patterns 
              and shapes emerging from the ground; they no doubt serve as well 
              as a motivating force for the crew to continue trying to &quot;complete 
              the picture,&quot; as house after house emerges.</p>
            <p class="text">In LUAS, Hixson has served as president and as a general 
              organizer, and he still leads many of the group's monthly field 
              trips. Under his tutelage, LUAS members have recorded bedrock mortar 
              holes in stony ledges, visited historic ranch sites dating to the 
              1870s, and investigated huge rock mounds thought by the landowner 
              to be burial cairns. Hixson also serves as a steward for the Texas 
              Historical Commission, giving periodic talks and assisting landowners 
              in preserving and documenting cultural remains on their properties.</p>
            <p class="text">Of course, the landowner Hixson most vividly recalls 
              meeting for the first time was Charlotte Graham, who came into the 
              Nightengale Center &quot;carrying a handful of Scallorn arrow points.&quot; 
              It was a critical connection that developed into a friendship and 
              strong working relationship. And from it emerged the opportunity 
              to tell the story of the folk who lived a thousand years ago, at 
              what has become known as the Graham-Applegate Rancheria.</p>
            <h3> Charlotte Graham: From Collector to Colleague</h3>
            <p class="text">Charlotte Graham, on whose rocky acres the Graham-Applegate 
              site was first discovered, serves the project in a far greater capacity 
              than mere landowner. Both in her kitchen &quot;lab,&quot; where 
              she has single-handedly washed, labeled, and catalogued nearly 12,000 
              artifacts, and on the site, where she has developed a keen eye for 
              subtle clues in the earth, the California native continues to play 
              a critical role in site operations. A &quot;recovered&quot; collector, 
              she has taken on a more steady, scientific approach in her work. 
              Where at one time she and her sister, Janice Zimmermann, occasionally 
              picked up and probed for arrow points and tools from the slopes 
              and draws near her house, both now have learned the value of plotting 
              artifact locations, excavating systematically, and preserving the 
              context of all the evidence. </p>
            <p class="text">Graham is adamant about safeguarding the site; in 
              fact, she is convinced that she was meant to have the property for 
              just that reason. While driving through the area with a realtor 
              several years ago, she says she felt a particular twinge when she 
              saw the property that was to become her home and, as it developed 
              later, the excavation site. &quot;For some reason, I knew I had 
              to have it. We made a deal on the spot. I didn't know why, then, 
              but I think now it was because I'm supposed to be the guardian of 
              the site and to help tell the story.&quot; </p>
            <p class="text">A former coach for the Pan American Games, Graham brings the passion 
              and endurance of an athlete to her work at the site. But, she notes 
              somewhat ruefully, &quot;I had no idea what I was getting into when 
              we first started.&quot; Nonetheless, even after several bouts of 
              bad health including a recent stint in the hospital, she is back 
              on the job, determined to &quot;get to the bottom&quot; of the site 
              and the many unanswered questions. </p>
            <p class="text">Graham's experience with coaching among the Aborigines 
              in Australia primed her with firsthand experiences with prehistoric 
              lifeways. She recalls sitting in a hut&#151;perhaps not unlike those 
              being unearthed on her property&#151;and watching the men come in 
              from a hunt, carrying fresh kill. &quot;They dropped the animal 
              in front of the women, and then walked off. I mean, those women 
              had to do everything!&quot; Thinking about the people that lived 
              here more than a 1000 years ago &quot;gives me goose bumps,&quot; 
              she says. &quot;I dig down and I'm standing on the same surface 
              they were. I don't even have to use my imagination to see it.&quot; 
            </p>
            <h3>Gene Schaffner: A Versatile Lieutenant </h3>
            <p class="text">Along with Graham, another critical leader at the 
              site has been Gene Schaffner of Horseshoe Bay. A Missouri native 
              and former nurse, Shaffner brings a questioning mind and meticulous 
              care to her work, Hixson says. When she and her husband, Bob, moved 
              to the Lake LBJ area from Illinois, they joined the Llano Uplift 
              Archeological Society (LUAS). Gene Schaffner served as president 
              from 1997-1999 and still leads tours for the public at the Nightengale 
              Archeological Society in Kingsland.</p>
            <p class="text">On a recent 101-degree afternoon there, Schaffner 
              took group after group through the center and&#151;with the same 
              enthusiasm&#151;headed for the outdoor interpretive trails in the 
              blazing sun. &quot;She brings a lot of energy to LUAS,&quot; Hixson 
              says. In addition to excavating, the Schaffners have also bought 
              equipment, tarps, and ladders for the project, items which can break 
              the budget of a small operation. Gene Schaffner also brings her 
              photographic skills to the site&#151;many of the images used in 
              this webpage are hers. 
            <h3>Help Wanted</h3>
            <p class="text">At the Nightengale Center, the camaraderie among the 
              three is evident&#151; there is much good-natured teasing. Charlotte 
              Graham points out that the group of excavators used to be much larger 
              &quot;before Chuck made us dig trenches through the midden with 
              a trowel!&quot; (Many archeologists will use shovels or larger tools 
              to excavate through the dense layers of rock in a typical burned 
              rock midden.) The trench they dug was &quot;thigh-high,&quot; Graham 
              claims. &quot;And then we did all the weighing of the rocks and 
              sorting them all by size. That's when we lost a lot of our volunteers.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p class="text">But, as the story is now known, Hixson and his crew 
              moved on from the midden to uncover&#151;with painstaking care&#151;the 
              remains of perhaps the largest &quot;rancheria&quot; yet documented 
              in central Texas, a rare place indeed. The success of the small 
              crew is still being told today in their detailed documentation of 
              the ancient house remains and work areas, now shown in the maps 
              and photos on this web page, and in the carefully catalogued artifacts 
              in the lab. Many archeologists and professors who have visited the 
              site have commented on the professional quality of the work being 
              done by the all-volunteer group. And as they knuckle down to uncover 
              what may be yet a SIXTH house at the rancheria, they are not too 
              proud to ask for help. </p>
