                  <p class="text"> Around A.D. 700, the aboriginal hunters of 
                    central Texas began using the bow and arrow and eventually 
                    discarded the older atlatl and dart that had been in use for 
                    thousands of years. The arrival of this new weapon technology 
                    is signaled in the archeological record by the appearance 
                    of small, thin, stone points that tipped arrows, in contrast 
                    to the larger, heavier ones used on darts or spears. Arrow 
                    points mark the end of the Archaic era and the beginning of 
                    what most archeologists call the Late Prehistoric period. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Early archeologists were aware of the late appearance 
                    of the bow and arrow in Texas (and the rest of North America), 
                    but it was not until excavations in Texas rockshelters between 
                    the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, that two distinct bow-and-arrow-using 
                    culture groups were identified.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The earlier of the two cultures is called the 
                    <em>Austin phase</em>. The earliest arrow points had notches 
                    flaked into the corners of the bases to facilitate hafting 
                    to the arrow shaft. Archeologists have identified several 
                    different styles of corner-notched arrow points in central 
                    Texas but the most common and widespread are the Scallorn 
                    type, the same type used at the Graham-Applegate rancheria. 
                    Scallorn points are found over wide areas of Texas and adjacent 
                    states. For this reason, some archeologists speak of an Austin 
                    <em>horizon</em>, meaning a set of cultural traits, principally 
                    the Scallorn point style, that extends over very large regions. 
                    This style of arrow point was used by the agricultural Woodland 
                    cultures of the midwest and early Pueblo cultures of the Southwest, 
                    as well as hunter-gatherers of south and coastal Texas. But 
                    in central Texas, the people who used Scallorn points had 
                    a different culture that grew out of a long and successful 
                    tradition of hunting and gathering among the hills and villages 
                    of central Texas. The Austin peoples reoccupied campsites 
                    of Late Archaic folk, built nearly identical house forms, 
                    and, in some cases, re-used Archaic-period earth ovens.</p>
                  <p class="text">There were differences from the Archaic, however, 
                    besides just the use of the bow and arrow. Formal cemeteries 
                    came into use for the first time in central Texas during this 
                    late period (although earlier Archaic-period cemeteries have 
                    been documented in sites south and east of the site). What 
                    is most unusual about the Austin phase cemeteries is the finding 
                    of Scallorn arrow points embedded in some of the skeletal 
                    remains. This suggests that warfare&#151;perhaps borne of 
                    territorial disputes or population pressures&#151;may have 
                    may have been a concern for the peoples of this time period. 
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Based on what was found at sites such as Loeve-Fox 
                    in Williamson County and Pat Parker in Travis County, burial 
                    grounds were unusually compact, occupying an area of around 
                    100 square feet. The bodies are invariably in a flexed position, 
                    with the heads often oriented towards the north. Isolated 
                    burials are also known, such as that found in the late 1930s 
                    in San Saba County near the Colorado River and a later discovery 
                    at Cottonwood Terrace, also near the Colorado River in Burnet 
                    County. Both these burials were covered by large rocks, either 
                    as grave markers or to protect the bodies from scavenging 
                    animals. Although the sample is very small, it is interesting 
                    that the known cemeteries occur on the prairies east of the 
                    escarpment, while only isolated burials are known to the west 
                    on the Edwards Plateau (including the Llano Uplift). It is 
                    likely that Austin folk living on the Plateau continued a 
                    long tradition of using natural sinkholes as burial places, 
                    a practice that often leaves little or no permanent trace.</p>
                  <p class="text">All the burials discussed above have been assigned 
                    to the Austin Phase because they contain Scallorn arrow points 
                    in or near the skeletons. One could make the argument that 
                    some of the points were included in the burials as grave goods, 
                    but in many cases, such as with some of the burials at Loeve-Fox, 
                    the position of the points suggests that they were embedded 
                    in the people buried there. Scallorn points were also apparently 
                    what killed the individuals from the two isolated burials 
                    mentioned above. The San Saba individual had two points in 
                    the chest cavity, while the Cottonwood Terrace skeleton had 
                    a point embedded in the neck area. It should also be pointed 
                    out that there are Austin phase burials, such as the two from 
                    Kyle Rockshelter in Hill County that do not contain arrow 
                    points.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Much of what is known about Austin phase culture 
                    comes from excavations of burial sites and rockshelters. Comparatively 
                    few are open campsites, especially ones with only (or even 
                    mostly) Austin phase occupation. The Graham-Applegate site 
                    is helping to provide a more-complete account of human life 
                    in central Texas in the last centuries of prehistory. For 
                    example, it is now known that Austin phase people used earth 
                    ovens that resulted in the formation of large burned rock 
                    piles (or middens), a cooking technique that archeologists 
                    once thought belonged exclusively to the earlier Archaic period. 
                    It appears that the Austin phase came to an end sometime in 
                    the fourteenth century, or at least the evidence of their 
                    culture diminishes or changes. </p>
                  <p class="text">Long after the Graham-Applegate rancheria was 
                    abandoned, a late Austin phase group, perhaps a hunting party, 
                    returned to the site and cooked a meal on a stone hearth. 
                    They repaired their arrows and tossed away broken Scallorn 
                    points. A radiocarbon date from the wood they burned fell 
                    to between A.D. 1285 and 1405, a very late time for these 
                    people. What finally happened to the Austin phase people is 
                    unknown. While it is possible they were wiped out by warfare, 
                    more likely they simply adopted the trappings of the succeeding 
                    Toyah phase folk and no longer made tools that we can identify 
                    with the Austin phase.</p>
