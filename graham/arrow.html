            <br><p class="text">The bow and arrow was a relatively new weapon system 
              in central Texas a thousand years ago when the Graham/Applegate 
              rancheria was inhabited. It had come into use only a few centuries 
              earlier, around A.D. 700, perhaps brought into the region by new 
              migrants, or more likely, simply adopted by the indigenous population. 
              The bow and arrow was spreading across much of North America around 
              this time, replacing the older atlatl and dart as the principal 
              weapon for hunting large game and for warfare. While some aboriginal 
              groups continued to use both weapon technologies, archeological 
              evidence in central Texas seems to point to a rapid and complete 
              replacement of the atlatl and dart by the bow and arrow.</p>
            <p class="text"> An interesting revelation from the excavations at 
              the Graham/Applegate site is that the hunters who resided in the 
              rancheria were apparently using both kinds of projectile weapons: 
              the atlatl and dart, as well as the bow and arrow. The most convincing 
              evidence for this was uncovered on the floor of House 1, the largest 
              structure at the site. A small stone point that once tipped an arrow 
              was found near two heavier points that probably once armed light 
              spears (darts) that would have been thrown with the atlatl. </p>
            <p class="text">The atlatl (or spear thrower) is a short stick, two 
              feet or so in length with a small prong or hook at one end, which 
              was used to throw a light spear or dart. Although simple in design, 
              it is an extremely effective weapon, allowing the user to throw 
              a spear much farther&#151;the length of a football field&#151;than 
              he could without it and with the force necessary to bring down large 
              game . The atlatl is a very ancient weapon&#151;no one really knows 
              how old, but it was in use in the Old World at least 20,000 years 
              ago&#151;and there is a strong likelihood that the earliest people 
              to enter the New World were equipped with it. </p>
            <p class="text"> On the other hand, the bow and arrow came into use 
              relatively late in the Americas. This weaponry was known to the 
              Late Paleolithic people of Europe over 10,000 years ago, but it 
              appears that the native peoples of the New World only took it up 
              during the last two thousand years. Perhaps the bow and arrow was 
              independently invented somewhere in North America, or, more likely, 
              the technology spread or diffused from the Old World. Unfortunately, 
              archeological evidence documenting the spread of the bow and arrow 
              and the atlatl and dart is largely lacking due to the fact that 
              these weapons were made primarily of wood and other perishable materials. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">The history and diffusion of these technologies is 
              traced almost entirely by the stone points used to tip the arrows 
              and darts, artifacts that survive to become part of the archeological 
              record. The larger, heavier dart points were shaped to a large degree 
              by percussion flaking, while the lighter, thin arrow points were 
              mostly pressure flaked. Because they are so small and light, stone 
              arrow points are often called &quot;bird points&quot; by collectors 
              but, in fact, they were used to hunt the same kind of animals as 
              the larger points hafted to darts&#151;deer, antelope, even bison. 
              Only under extraordinary conditions have prehistoric artifacts made 
              from perishable materials survived to the present day in the relatively 
              humid climate of central Texas. </p>
            <p class="text">No prehistoric bows are known to have been found 
              in this region, but in a rockshelter near Waco, several fragments 
              of prehistoric arrows were recovered during excavations in the early 
              1960s. They date to a slightly more recent time than the Austin 
              phase but perhaps offer an indication of the kinds of arrows used 
              by the hunters of the Graham-Applegate rancheria. The main shafts 
              of the arrows were made from cane, and because of their delicacy 
              (and to add forward weight), the front of the shaft was fitted with 
              a short foreshaft of hard wood, the tip of which was notched for 
              the stone arrow point. Virtually all prehistoric arrows that have 
              been found in the United States (mostly in dry caves and rockshelters 
              of the arid Southwest) are made of cane and therefore are extremely 
              light compared to most modern arrows. This explains why such light-weight 
              stone points were attached to them.</p><br>
