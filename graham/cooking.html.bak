                  <p class="text">The people who lived at the Graham-Applegate 
                    rancheria were great consumers of granite rock; they brought 
                    many tons of it into the settlement from isolated outcrops 
                    in the surrounding area. Some of the rocks went into the construction 
                    of the houses, providing material for the wall supports and 
                    central hearths, but by far the greatest amount of rock was 
                    used in the cooking of food. Most rocks when heated in a fire 
                    absorb and store heat. Long after the fire has died down, 
                    the rocks continue to release the heat, making them ideal 
                    heating elements for different kinds of stone-age cooking 
                    &quot;appliances.&quot; In prehistoric times, the people of 
                    central Texas made full use of this kind of cooking technology, 
                    constructing stone hearths in many different shapes and sizes. 
                    Most interestingly, they constructed earth ovens&#151;layered 
                    arrangements of hot rocks and food placed in shallow pits 
                    and capped by a thick layer of earth. These were used to cook 
                    many kinds of foods but particularly certain plant foods that 
                    require long cooking before they are edible or their full 
                    nutritional value is realized. When the rocks cracked into 
                    small pieces from repeated heatings, they were tossed out 
                    and the oven pits re-lined with new rocks. The huge mounds 
                    of fire-cracked rocks, or burned rock &quot;middens,&quot; 
                    that built up over time around these often inconspicuous ovens 
                    have long confounded archeologists. </p>
            <p class="text">Virtually all the cooking features&#151;hearths and 
              ovens&#151;that have been studied in central Texas were constructed 
              of limestone rocks. The Edwards Plateau that dominates the region 
              is made up of Cretaceous limestone and was the only rock available 
              in most places. However, this is not the case at the Graham-Applegate 
              site. Millions of years ago, erosion removed a portion of the Cretaceous 
              limestone on the northeastern part of the Plateau, exposing a 2500-square-mile 
              region of ancient metamorphic and igneous rock known today as the 
              Llano Uplift. The Graham-Applegate rancheria is located in the southeastern 
              part of the Llano Uplift in an area of granite bedrock. In the immediate 
              area of the site, the granite near the surface has weathered into 
              small gravel-size fragments, except for thin horizontal seams (known 
              as pegmatites) of more consolidated feldspar and quartz rock. Along 
              the nearby arroyos where the pegmatite seams are exposed, ancient 
              people could have gathered rocks large enough for their building 
              and cooking purposes.</p>
            <p class="text"> The rancheria people constructed dozens of small, 
              flat circular hearths on which they grilled or roasted different 
              kinds of foods. Unfortunately, with the exception of mussel shells, 
              few food remains have survived in the sandy, gravelly soils at the 
              site. Scores of these shells have been found scattered about the 
              area, particularly around the small hearths on which they were cooked. 
              Mussels were probably collected from the Llano River a half-mile 
              (0.8 km) away. Considering the large numbers of arrow points found 
              at Graham-Applegate, animal foods must have been very important 
              but the direct evidence is no longer there: even bones do not last 
              long in the ground in the site area.</p>
            <p class="text"> The single largest feature at the rancheria is the 
              earth oven and its surrounding pile of fire-cracked rock (burned 
              rock midden) that dominates the southwestern corner of the site. 
              While burned rock middens of limestone rock are common on the Plateau, 
              very few granite middens have been recorded by archeologists in 
              the Llano Uplift. Why this is so is not yet clear; perhaps earth 
              ovens were only rarely constructed of granite because they made 
              inferior heating elements, although recent experiments do not seem 
              to bear this out. Granite takes and holds heat well but breaks apart 
              after only one or two uses. Limestone, in contrast, can sometimes 
              be reheated five or more times before breaking. Perhaps granitic 
              burned rock middens are more difficult to detect on the Llano Uplift 
              because of the soil and topographic conditions there. </p>
            <p class="text">The midden at Graham-Applegate went unnoticed until 
              a test pit was excavated over it. Almost 30 feet across and nearly 
              2 feet thick, the burned rock midden at the Graham-Applegate rancheria 
              contains perhaps as much as 20 tons of burned rock, representing 
              many oven firings and subsequent cleanings. Few food remains were 
              found in the burned rock debris surrounding the oven; there were 
              a few small fragments of a large, deer-sized animal, mussel shells 
              both large and small, and a small amount of charred plant material. 
              The central area of the midden contains traces of numerous pits 
              dug out over time for ovens. These pits were probably lined with 
              large granite boulders. The soil in the interior is almost black 
              from the many fires that burned there. Outside the midden area the 
              soil is a light tan but, closer to the center, it becomes more and 
              more stained by carbon. Evidence from other sites indicates these 
              ovens were constructed to bake certain plant foods for long periods 
              of time. Just what was cooked at the rancheria is not yet known, 
              although we have some ideas. Sotol, an important food that was baked 
              by aboriginal people in earth ovens, does not grow in large numbers 
              (if at all) in the sandy soils of the Llano Uplift. A related species, 
              a kind of narrow-leaf yucca, however, does; the edible parts include 
              the emerging flower stalk available in late spring and the green 
              seed pods that develop a little later in the year. Both yucca and 
              sotol could be baked in earth ovens. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today, the site is covered by dense stands of 
                    prickly pear cactus, much to the consternation of the crew&#151;especially 
                    those who don't watch their step. Ranching in recent times 
                    has no doubt encouraged its spread but this plant was certainly 
                    present in the Llano Uplift in the Late Prehistoric. The green, 
                    pad-like stems, or nopales, were a reliable food source as 
                    were the fruit or tunas when ripe in late summer. If the rancheria 
                    was occupied primarily in winter, nopales would have been 
                    available for earth-oven baking; if the stay was extended 
                    into spring, wild onions and yucca stems would have been an 
                    abundant food source for the rancheria dwellers.</p>
