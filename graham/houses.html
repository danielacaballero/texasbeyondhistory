            <br><p class="text"><a name="1"></a>For many decades, archeologists were 
              pessimistic about ever finding remains of prehistoric houses in 
              central Texas. The mobile bands of hunter-gatherers who lived in 
              this part of the state were thought to have constructed very flimsy 
              huts or skin-covered tents that would leave little trace for archeologists 
              to find, especially after hundreds or thousands of years. This changed 
              in the early 1960s when unusual stone circles were discovered eroding 
              out of the sandy shoreline of Lake Buchanan, a large artificial 
              reservoir 60 miles northwest of Austin. There was speculation at 
              the time that these stone circles were the remains of ancient structures, 
              although other explanations also were proposed. Some thought they 
              might be the remains of specialized cooking facilities. Excavations 
              of similar circles at the Lion Creek site in Burnet County in the 
              mid 1970s and the Turkey Bend Ranch site in Concho County in the 
              late 1980s provided additional evidence that these features were 
              probably the foundations of houses built by Archaic and Late Prehistoric 
              peoples. </p>
            <p class="text"> At the Graham-Applegate site, the remains of what were tentatively identified as five houses were excavated, and these are very similar to the stone circles discovered 
              earlier elsewhere. In this section, we explore some of the evidence that initially led us to believe these remains were houses. This interpretation has since changed (see <a href="file:///U:/tarl-tbh/TBH%20Website%20Temp/graham/new-interpretations.html" target="_blank">A New Interpretation of Features</a> in this exhibit).            </p>
            <h3 class="text">Elements of a House?</h3>
            <p class="text">As at the other sites, all that has survived 
              of these features are a central stone pavement where the hearth 
              fires may have burned and a ring of stone clusters surrounding this pavement 
              that may have helped support the walls. Exactly how the outer ring of stones 
              of these possible houses supported the walls is unclear. Some stones may 
              have been used to hold down the hides or whatever material was covering 
              the structures, while others braced the bases of the thin saplings 
              that are believed to have supported the walls. At the Graham-Applegate 
              site, we thought the stones likely were used primarily for the latter 
              reason, that is, to stabilize the posts in the loose, gravelly soils 
              around the site. While no traces of post holes (or woodpost stains) 
              can be seen in the soil, the elevation of these rocks in relationship 
              to the floor surface indicates that, in most cases, the posts were 
              placed in shallow holes dug by the aboriginal builders. The rocks 
              would have been placed around the base to prevent the posts from 
              shifting or coming out of the ground during strong winds. It is 
              also possible that a shallow trench was dug completely around the 
              wall area, in part to create a trap for rain water, but also for 
              the wall posts.</p>
            <p class="text"> If these indeed were houses, we can only speculate as to what the superstructure 
              may have looked like based on materials and technologies available 
              to the people during the Late Prehistoric. The brief descriptions 
              left by early explorers of North America and the more-detailed descriptions 
              of recent houses built by people with a similar level of technology 
              also aid us in reconstructing the rancheria houses. Most likely 
              a dome-like frame was constructed by arranging a ring of green sapling 
              posts upright in the ground, and then bending upper ends inward 
              and tying them together. Small branches would then be attached horizontally 
              to these posts to form a framework to support the covering. Many 
              covering materials would have been available, and early Spanish 
              accounts of Indian houses in what is now south Texas mention grass, 
              woven mats, and animal hides.</p>

            <p class="text">There was a curious aspect to these possible houses that set 
              them apart from other known hunter-gatherer dwellings. Much of the interior 
              space was devoted to a large, central paved area or hearth, leaving 
              only a relatively narrow (a meter or less) ring of living area between 
              the hearth and walls (note the spatial arrangement in the artist's 
              scene of hut interior). With some of the &quot;houses,&quot; it is possible 
              that the living space extended onto the stone pavement, while in 
              others the pavement seems to have been raised somewhat above the 
              floor. One theory is that the pavement served as a &quot;work bench&quot; 
              of sorts, where tasks could be performed above or away from the 
              floor and close to the fire for light and warmth. For obvious reasons, 
              a large fire would not have been built on these hearths inside a 
              thatch-covered structure, and the archeological evidence supports 
              this. Very little charcoal staining was noted in the hearth fill 
              of &quot;House 1&quot;&#151;fires were built there but not intense ones such 
              as those in the earth oven. Some Indian groups in the American West 
              would heat rocks outside their dwellings and then bring the hot 
              stones inside for heating without the hazards of smoke and flames. 
              The presence of these large central hearths has led to speculation 
              that this type of structure was used as a sweat lodge, but evidence 
              from Graham-Applegate seemed to support the view that these were 
              places where people lived and carried out domestic activities. Several 
              of these structures are in very close proximity to one another, 
              which would be unusual for sweat lodges. Three of the structures 
              have small hearths outside their walls, along with food remains, 
              more in keeping with a small hut-like dwelling where cooking was 
              done outdoors whenever possible.</p>
            <h3><a name="ga"></a>The Graham-Applegate &quot;Houses&quot;</h3>
            <p class="text">The feature originally identified as House 1 is the largest and the best preserved 
              of the five presumed houses  excavated at Graham-Applegate. The rocks 
              used to stabilize the walls (<a href="images/LL419-CH1.html" target="_blank" class="text">wall 
              supports</a>) form a nearly complete and well-defined ring. The 
              large gap in this ring on the south side is a clear indication that 
              the doorway faced in that direction, away from the prevailing winds 
              of winter cold fronts or &quot;northers.&quot; The diameter of the 
              entire structure is 4.25 m (14.2 ft) and has a floor area (including 
              central hearth) of around 12.5 square meters. A large stone pavement 
              or <a href="images/LL419-CH43.html" target="_blank" class="text">central 
              hearth</a> covers the middle of the floor area. It provided a platform 
              for the small fires that would have warmed the house and perhaps also served 
              as low table or work bench. A cross-section of the hearth reveals 
              that a shallow basin was first dug and then filled with stones of 
              different sizes to create a level surface. This presumed house also contains 
              many more artifacts both on the floor area and outside it than the 
              other &quot;houses&quot; and has at least five small cooking hearths outside 
              its walls. The clutter about this structure might mean it was occupied 
              (and perhaps reoccupied and rebuilt) over a long period, allowing 
              more refuse to build up around it. Or perhaps &quot;House 1&quot;&#151;with 
              its larger size and close proximity to the communal earth oven&#151;was 
              the focal point for activities of the entire rancheria. <br>
              <br>
              The feature first identified as &quot;House 2&quot; is a much smaller structure than &quot;House 1&quot; and is similar 
              in size to the three other &quot;houses&quot; that were discovered later. The outer 
              diameter is a little over three meters (nearly 10 feet) and has 
              a floor area with the central hearth of about seven square meters. 
              Perhaps this is the &quot;normal&quot; size of houses for the rancheria. 
              The central hearth in this presumed house, though of a slightly smaller diameter, 
              is much like the one in &quot;House 1.&quot; Circular in plan, it contains large, 
              nearly boulder-sized rocks as well as smaller ones. The surface 
              is slightly uneven which could have resulted from later stone robbing. 
              The rocks that supported the posts and wall structure of this &quot;house&quot; 
              do not form a continuous ring. Bedrock lies close to the surface 
              in areas where there are no rocks, and therefore digging pits in 
              which to place posts would have been next to impossible. Still, 
              something had to support the wall in those areas, and stones might 
              have simply been placed on the ground around the posts without first 
              digging a hole. The exposed rocks would then have been vulnerable 
              to later stone robbing after the house was abandoned.</p>
            <p class="text"><br>
              The remains thought to be &quot;Houses&quot; 3, 4, and 5 were laid out in a closely spaced linear 
              arrangement on what is now the edge of a densely wooded area that 
              extends north of the site. The three presumed houses share many construction 
              details, including unusual triangular&#151;rather than round&#151;central 
              hearths composed of cobble-sized rocks. It seems obvious that the 
              structures were built at the same time by closely related households: 
              they are set apart both by distance and in the way they were constructed 
              from &quot;Houses&quot; 1 and 2. What all this means is not yet clear. Unfortunately, 
              we are not exactly sure when these &quot;houses&quot; were built. The projectile 
              points found with them (or next to them) cover a period of many 
              thousands of years (from Late Paleoindian to Late Archaic) and no 
              charcoal for radiocarbon dating has yet been recovered. The unexcavated 
              central hearth of &quot;House 5&quot; contains a distinct carbon stain in the 
              fill around the rocks and eventually may yield charcoal.</p>
            <p class="text">A singular pile of quartz rocks two meters long connects 
              &quot;Houses 3 and 4,&quot; stacked there by the rancheria folk for some unknown 
              purpose. Quartz was not a very useful rock for these people. It 
              tends to break rapidly into many small, sharp shards when exposed 
              to heat, making it a poor choice for cooking stones. Unlike quartz 
              crystal, the quartz found around the site area does not flake well 
              and this rock was rarely used to make chipped stone tools. Perhaps 
              they were stacking the stone there simply to get it out of the way. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Given the rarity of prehistoric structural features in the archeological record, it is important to consider all possibilities during investigations. In this case, initial interpretations were disproved by evidence gleaned in later technical studies, discussed in the <a href="new-interpretations.html" target="_blank">New Interpretations</a> section. </p>
