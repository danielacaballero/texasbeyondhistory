    <td><p>Throughout this project, we had wondered where  Ransom and Sarah might have been buried. We found no death certificate for  Ransom Williams, and speculated that he might have been buried on his farm or  perhaps with friends or relatives at the Antioch Colony cemetery (near Buda) or  somewhere near Manchaca. But this was all speculation. Our archival research  did discover a death certificate for Sarah, and it stated that Sarah Williams&rsquo;  maiden name was Houston and that she died on March 11, 1921 in San Marcos at  the age of 70. </p>
      <p>Online searches of cemetery databases lead to the finding of  several Sarah Williamses who were buried in or near San Marcos, but none of  them had the right death date. Finally, a breakthrough came when it was  discovered that one online listing had been recorded incorrectly. In the <em>Find-A-Grave</em> database for the San  Marcos-Blanco Cemetery in Hays County was a listing for a Sarah Williams who  reportedly died in 1902. However, the headstone photograph linked to this grave  seemed to show a death year of 1921 along with &ldquo;AGE 70.&rdquo; A quick trip to the  cemetery on the north side of San Marcos confirmed that this was indeed the  grave marker for the Sarah Williams who was once married to Ransom Williams. </p>
<p>The headstone is a tall rectangular cast concrete  marker with an inscription that reads: </p>
<p>SARAH<br>
  WILLIAMS<br>
  DIED<br>
  MAR 11, 1921<br>
  AGE 70<br>
  AT REST</p>
<p>The San Marcos-Blanco Cemetery is a 10-acre  African American graveyard with burials dating back to 1886. While it contains  more than 300 marked graves, it is obvious that there are many other graves  without headstones as indicated by depressions, vegetation patterns, and  surface artifacts. It is interesting that Sarah&rsquo;s grave is isolated from other  marked graves nearby, but adjacent to it is a slight depression with darker  green grass and a bent metal stake marker. This is most likely a grave, and it  is certainly possible that this is burial site of Ransom Williams, who died in  ca. 1901. It is also possible that some of Ransom and Sarah&rsquo;s children are  buried nearby.</p>
