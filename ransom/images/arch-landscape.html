      <td width="480" valign="top"><p>The examination of the Williams farm  system began with a comprehensive landscape analysis focusing on the 45-acre  farm and its relationships to the surrounding areas. This work involved many  different tasks: gathering historic and modern aerial photographs and maps;  mapping of onsite features (e.g., rock alignments, remnants of barbed wire and  wooden fences, rock mounds) and landscape topography at different levels using  GPS equipment and an electronic total station; pedestrian survey and collection  of surface artifacts; metal detector surveying and documentation of metal  detected artifacts; mapping of very large hardwood trees and documentation of  tree features; and backhoe trenching to investigate rock walls and a possible  pond location.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;The onsite investigations were limited to the  portion of the site located within the state-owned right of way, but the entire  45-acre property and surrounding areas were examined using the historic and  modern aerial photographs and maps. </p>
        <p>One of the main results of this  landscape analysis was the creation of an integrated GeoPDF file that consists  of many layers of spatial data linked to real-world coordinates. Each aerial  image or map layer was georectified to the same UTM coordinate system, which  allowed the PAI archeologists to overlay and display different types of data in  many visual formats to look at spatial relationships between variables. As it  turns out, the spatial patterns discovered in this manner are quite meaningful  and reveal a great deal about the history and evolution of the Williams  farmstead. </p>
        <p>Knowing where the 45-acre farmstead  is located was the starting point for the landscape study. The first step was  to rectify the old historic maps and aerial photographs with modern maps and  aerial images. We began with the 1874 plat map that showed the subdivision of a  portion of the John G. McGehee League into 40-acre tracts. Once this map was  linked with modern Travis County Appraisal District maps, it was then easy to  transfer the location of Williams' Lot No. 11 onto various modern maps. The  correspondence between maps was not perfect, and some adjustment had to be made  for the additional 5 acres, but it soon became apparent our link between the  old and new maps was solid. Once this was established, we could look at the  location of Williams' 45-acre property, including his house and all the other  features on the land, in relation to all types of old and modern spatial  imagery. </p>
        <p>As shown on the U.S. Geological  Survey map, &nbsp;Williams&rsquo; property is  located on the uplands south of Bear Creek. Because there was no stream on his  property, water would be a precious resource on his land. It is also notable  that the south and west half of the property is relatively flat while the north  and east portions have a significant slope. The slope of the land was an  important factor dictating how Ransom Williams would use his property. &nbsp;The base map is the 1988 Oak Hill Quadrangle  by the U.S. Geological Survey, and there has been considerably more development  in the area since the 1980s.</p>
        <p>A comparison of aerial photographs  of the Williams property in 1937 and in 2005 shows how the land has changed  over time.&nbsp; (Topographic lines at 2-ft  intervals have been added to both images.) The 2005 photo (top half) shows how  the property looked about the time the historic research on the farmstead was  beginning. The area was densely wooded and a large housing subdivision was  located to the west. In 1937, the 45-acre property looked quite different. Some  cultivated fields are obvious in the old photo, while roads and fencelines are  visible as lines of cleared vegetation found along property boundary edges. It  is notable that the southern half of the property was being cultivated in 1937  while the northern half of the property was left wooded. There is considerable  evidence indicating that this was the way that Ransom Williams originally laid  out his farm. </p>
        <p>Once all of the landscape mapping  data were compiled and analyzed, a picture of the layout of Williams&rsquo; 45-acre  farm emerged (see aerial map with features plotted). Topographically, the  location made perfect sense to incorporate the maximum drainage area for  channeling rainfall into the livestock pond.&nbsp;  The house location was judiciously selected because it was on the east  side of the cultivated fields, where the family could watch over the fields and  plant a garden nearby, but it was still fairly close to the corral complex and  the livestock pond. At the time the Williams family lived on the farm, access  to and across the property was probably along a north-south road along the east  edge of the property. It is likely that Ransom Williams would have gone off his  property in the northeast corner and followed an old road to the north or east  to go down to Bear Creek. </p>
        <p>There are many components that would  be considered typical of late nineteenth-century rural farms and ranches that  are not shown on this map, but this does not mean that they did not exist. Some  important features that probably existed on the Williams farmstead were  not found. Examples of these types of features include a chicken coop,  pig pens, cow barn, fenced garden, corncrib, hay shed, and smokehouse. </p>
        <p>The oral history interviews are  filled with peoples&rsquo; recollections of raising corn, cotton, hay, garden  vegetables, chickens, pigs, and hogs, as well as mentions of livestock barns,  chicken pens, pig pens, hay and corn sheds, and smokehouses. Once the  above-ground structures are gone, these types of features are nearly invisible  archeologically, so it is not surprising that we found no evidence of them. But  the farmstead did yield lots of evidence that hints at the existence of many of  these features. We found bones of chickens, pigs, and cows, a garden hoe,  charred corn kernels, and a patented hand-sheller for removing kernels from  corncobs. When taken together, the oral history and archeological evidence  suggest that the farm had a smokehouse and other structures to house animals  and store hay and corn. The oral histories also mention vegetable gardens and  orchards, and charred fragments of sweet potato and peach pits were found on  the Williams farmstead.</p></td>
