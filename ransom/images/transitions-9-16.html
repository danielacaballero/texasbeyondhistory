      <p> In his  article on &ldquo;The Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau Schools  in Texas, 1865&ndash;1870,&rdquo; historian Alton Hornsby, Jr. cited increasing  racial prejudice, the growth of the KKK, and spread of violence as factors  limiting the success of the establishing black schools in Texas in the late  1860s. He wrote: </p>
      <p><em>Growing  violence of the Ku Klux Klan variety occupied the major part of the [Freedmen&rsquo;s  Bureau] reports coming from Texas  in late 1868 and early 1869. This violence, coupled with intimidation and  discrimination, was listed repeatedly as the major factor hampering Negro  education. General Reynolds reported in the fall of 1868 that juries in Texas were beginning to  exhibit flagrant examples of racial discrimination in their evaluation of  testimony and in their verdicts. Ku Klux Klansmen &ldquo;practiced barbarous  cruelties upon the freedmen,&rdquo; and Negro morale was at its lowest point since  the war. Reynolds said that the Klansmen were &ldquo;most numerous, bold, and  aggressive east of the Trinity River. . . The  murder of negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep accurate  account of them.</em>      </p>
