      <p>Of all the  nineteenth-century black newspapers in the Austin area, one of the most influential was  the <em>Sunday School Herald </em>(1889&ndash;1892)  and its antecedent, <em>The Herald</em> (1893&ndash;1917). Edited by the Reverend L. L. Campbell, the <em>Sunday School Herald</em> was touted as providing &ldquo;The Highest Religion,  Education training&rdquo; and a &ldquo;A Newspaper Devoted to the Moral Religious and  Educational Interests of the Baptist Sunday Schools and denomination of Texas.&rdquo; A prominent  figure in Austin&rsquo;s history, Campbell became the pastor of the Third  Baptist (now Ebenezer) Church in 1892 where he remained in leadership for  thirty-five years. Many of the 1892 issues of the <em>Sunday School Herald</em> have survived, and most have articles on  religious and morality topics, along with a fair number of advertisements for  national and local products and services. The advertisements undoubtedly helped  make the paper financially successful, but ads for alcohol were noticeably  absent.<br>
