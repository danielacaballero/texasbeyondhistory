  The number of artifacts related to sewing and clothing that were found at the site suggest that Sarah Williams, and possibly her daughters as well, may have been sewing for neighbors in addition to fulfilling the needs of the Williams family.</p>
<p>
Velcro and zippers, so popular in clothing today, are inventions of the 20th century.  In the 1800’s, clothing was fastened with ties or laces, small metal hooks, and most frequently, with buttons.  Over ____ buttons were uncovered during the excavation of the Williams’ homestead.  They include a wide variety of styles, sizes and materials.  Some were carved from bone or shell.  Some were made of metal, glass or hard rubber.  Some are small, about 3/8 inch, and plain in design and were commonly used on men’s shirts.  A few of the buttons are fancier with color or engraved designs and probably added a fancier touch of to clothing worn to church or for special occasions.</p>
<p>
Scissors, thimbles, needles, pins, and thread would have completed Sarah’s sewing kit. Some of these items were just about worn out! </p>

  </em>This rusty fragment of scissors is missing its blades. Did you know the  invention of  scissors can be traced to the spring scissors used in ancient Egypt as early as  1500 BC? Modern scissors, a simple  combination of levers that pivot around a point between the blade and the  handles, came into use in Rome and the Far East at about the same time, 100  CE.&nbsp; Over time, they have been made out  of a variety of metals, and though different styles have developed, the basic  shape has not varied much.

  <p>The thimble shown at right probably protected Sarah's and the girls' thumbs from being jabbed by their needles while sewing. The earliest metal thimbles date to the Han  Dynasty (206 BC &ndash; 202 CE) in ancient China.&nbsp;&nbsp; In medieval Europe, thimbles  were made from thick leather, bone, and ivory, in addition to metals such as  brass.&nbsp; In the 1700&rsquo;s, access to cheap  silver in the Americas made silver thimbles a popular gift for ladies.&nbsp; While thimbles may be very plain or covered  with small geometric designs, they can also be very elaborate with engraved  pictures and initials. herds of buffalo&#151;those big shaggy beasts&#151;pass by.</em><span class="blue"><em>

 <p class="blue">The safety pin is a more practical version of the  fancy brooches women and men in ancient Greece used to hold the draped sections  of their clothing together.&nbsp; The modern  safety pin was patented by an American mechanic named Walter Hunt in 1849.&nbsp; Hunt used an 8 inch piece of brass wire and  design a coil in the center so the pin would &ldquo;spring&rdquo; open and a clasp at one  end to shield the wearer from the sharp point. The safety pins found at the Ransom Williams farmstead are bent and broken. </p>

 <p>   Hook and eye enclosures, measuring less that a  half inch, were often used on the neckline and the cuffs of dresses.&nbsp; They could also be sewn one after the other  in a very closely-spaced line down the back of a dress to join the fabric like  a step-by-step version of a zipper. &nbsp;&nbsp;Catalogues  from the late 1800&rsquo;s advertise hooks and eyes, 2 dozen to a card, in black and  silver.</p>
