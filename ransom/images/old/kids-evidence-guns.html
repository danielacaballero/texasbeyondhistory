	<p><img src="kids-dr-dirt-guns.jpg" width="288" height="203" align="left"><span class="whatsstyle">A gun was an important tool for people living in rural areas in the late 1800's.  Farmers usually needed to hunt to add food to their family table. They also needed a weapon to protect their farm from intruders and their livestock from attacks by wild animals, such as wolves and coyotes. For these reasons, the archeologists were not surprised to find gun parts and ammunition at the Williams farm. They were a bit surprised, however, at the many types of gun-related artifacts they uncovered. </span></p>
 
    <span class="whatsstyle">The archeologists found a wide variety of ammunition, including shells for .22, .32 and .42 caliber weapons.  One 12-gauge shotgun shell has the name WINCHESTER engraved on it while another bears the name PETERS.  Several cartridge cases, left over after the bullet is fired, were also found.  They also uncovered the remains of different kinds of percussion caps used on muzzle-loading weapons of the Civil War period.</span>
    <p class="whatsstyle">In addition to the ammunition, the archeologists found the rusted remains of  a variety of weapons, including a hammer and breech plug. These were part of a black powder muzzle-loading shotgun.   (Muzzle-loading guns were loaded from the top, or front end of the gun.) Based on cartridge heads, at least three shotguns are represented. A shotgun is a very versatile firearm that can be used for hunting birds and small game (like quail, dove, squirrels, and rabbits) as well as large game (such as deer). A shotgun could also provide a good deal of security and is an excellent close-range weapon for self defense. Living in an isolated location during the Jim Crow era, the Williamses were certainly aware of the potential for racial violence, and personal protection may have been an important consideration.</p>	</td>

	  <p class="whatsstyle">The trigger guard shown below is probably from a Flobert rifle. Based on a picture from an 1895 catalogue, this type of gun cost around $2.50. The Flobert was a single shot rifle often used for target practice. Because it was a simple and relatively inexpensive gun, it would have been a good choice for a kid's first gun.  </p>

  <p class="whatsstyle">Archeologists also found a part of an Enfield rifle, the oldest style of gun found at the farm. It was a brass butt plate which would have fit on the end of the gun, the part that rests against the shooter's shoulder. Enfield rifles were used widely during the Civil War. After the war, the large surplus would have made this a  relatively cheap large caliber rifle to own.</p>
  <p class="whatsstyle">All these guns would have needed repairs from time to time, and the archeologists found several tools for just that use.  A  wrench used for working on a muzzle-loading gun and a pocket screwdriver are pictured below. The screwdriver was  a folding set that would have been used to disassemble and repair firearms. </p>
