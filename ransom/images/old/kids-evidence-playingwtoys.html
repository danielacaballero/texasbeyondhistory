	<p><img src="kids-dr-dirt-trowel-bubble-playwtoys.png" width="288" height="203" align="left"><span class="whatsstyle"> Ransom and Sarah Williams had a total of nine children while they lived on the farm, so we can imagine that toys were important items to have on hand! Archeologists uncovered a variety of toy parts. Some were rusty, and  some were broken into pieces, but with  careful study, most of them could be recognized.   Among the  small pieces of  white ceramics  are remnants of a doll and  doll-sized cups and saucers.  There also are several types of marbles,  a rubber ball, and even a cap gun.  </span></p>
 
    <span class="whatsstyle">The porcelain doll pieces found at the farn are typical of dolls made in the U.S. and Europe in the late 19th century.  Typically, the doll’s head, and sometimes the arms and lower legs, were made of porcelain,  papier-mache or a blend of sawdust and glue, and the body was made of leather or fabric.  No doubt the Williams’ girls sewed  dresses for their dolls, held tea parties and learned about caring for babies, just like girls do today. 
    </p>
	</span>
    <p class="whatsstyle">Dolls and other human-like figures have been popular playthings for many thousands of years.    Before the mid-1800’s, dolls were made by hand, one at a time.  Some were fancy with embroidered faces and button eyes, but most were plain and made from materials that were readily available such as wood, bone, corn husks and scraps of yarn or fabric.  </p>	</td>

Children in many cultures have played a variety of games with similar small round objects.  Marbles was a very popular game among American boys from colonial times to the mid-20th century.  Often boys made their own marbles out of clay, drying them in the sun until they were hard.  The first mass-produced clay marbles in the U.S. were made by S. C. Dyke in Akron, Ohio in the 1890’s.  A decade later, manufactured glass marbles began to appear in stores.   </p></td>

	<p class="whatsstyle">The handle and barrel of a CHIEF cap pistol found at the site is another store-bought toy the Williams’ children owned.  It is missing the firing mechanism.  The charge was a simple mixture of powdered chemicals in small dots between two layers of paper layers.  Gases created by the chemical mixture made a loud sound when the cap was struck.  Boys enjoyed imitating their fathers hunting and acting out the exciting cowboy stories in the books they read.  Cap guns became even more popular during the 1930’s and 40’s because of the flood of Western movies and stars such as Tom Mix, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. </p> </td>
