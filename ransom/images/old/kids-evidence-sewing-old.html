  The number of artifacts related to sewing and clothing that were found at the site suggest that Sarah Williams, and possibly her daughters as well, may have been sewing for neighbors in addition to fulfilling the needs of the Williams family.</p>
<p>
Velcro and zippers, so popular in clothing today, are inventions of the 20th century.  In the 1800’s, clothing was fastened with ties or laces, small metal hooks, and most frequently, with buttons.  Over ____ buttons were uncovered during the excavation of the Williams’ homestead.  They include a wide variety of styles, sizes and materials.  Some were carved from bone or shell.  Some were made of metal, glass or hard rubber.  Some are small, about 3/8 inch, and plain in design and were commonly used on men’s shirts.  A few of the buttons are fancier with color or engraved designs and probably added a fancier touch of to clothing worn to church or for special occasions.</p>
<p>
Scissors, thimbles, needles, pins, and thread would have completed Sarah’s sewing kit.

    should see my school. Sergeant Stackhouse opened it in the south end of the 
    fort commissary, which is a warehouse for storing corn and flour and other 
    things the soldiers need. But to make it look more like a school, my teacher 
    went to a lot of trouble. <table width="200" align="right"><tr><td><img src="kids-thimble-sm.jpg" width="200" height="300" align="right" class="thumbimg"></td>

    to him, we pupils sit on benches with seats and backs, with layers of clean 
    white sacks that make them softer. My teacher is a very nice man. He must 
    love teaching. Mother can't believe it. Here he is teaching almost forty children, 
    all different ages at the same time, and not charging any of us a" red cent."

  <p>I
    love living here on the frontier. We live on a big ranch, in a solid stone 
    house. Even the corrals are made of stone. I can see the hills beyond, and 
    the valley is covered in wildflowers in the spring. When we first moved there, 
    I was afraid. The house was in a shambles, with broken glass from the windows 
    lying on the floor. And there were tooth marks on the front door, where some 
    wild animal&#151;perhaps a wolf or a panther&#151;had gnawed on it. Now I 
    love to watch the animals here. There are deer and antelope, and some days, 
    great herds of buffalo&#151;those big shaggy beasts&#151;pass by.</em><span class="blue"><em>

  <p>our family had to move 
    to a ranch further down the river called Fort Davis, for protection from the 
    Indians. There were about a hundred of us there, living in houses surrounded 
    by a wall. The men would sit on the wall to watch for Indians. Being there 
    with the other families made us feel safer, and we had some happy times. I'll 
    never forget the day we had the flag raising. I was chosen to carry the flag 
    in our parade. We marched around the fort as band music played. Then the men 
    fired three shots and raised the flag. Later, there was barbecue and dancing 
    all through the night.
