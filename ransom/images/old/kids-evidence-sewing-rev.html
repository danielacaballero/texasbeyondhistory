Archeologists found all of these items at the  Williams farmstead. In fact, there were so many artifacts  related to sewing and clothing that we think Sarah, and possibly her daughters  as well, may have been sewing for neighbors in addition to taking care of the  needs of their own family. </p>
 
   The archeologists found a pair of rusty  scissors handles (missing their blades). They were just the right size  for cutting fabric. Did you know the invention of scissors can be traced to the  spring scissors used in ancient Egypt  as early as 1500 BC? Modern scissors, a simple combination of levers that pivot  around a point between the blade and the handles, came into use in Rome and the Far East at  about the same time, 100 CE.&nbsp; Over time, they have been made out of a  variety of metals, and though different styles have developed, the basic shape  has not varied much.</p>
 </span>
 <p class="blue">The thimble shown below probably  protected Sarah's and the girls' thumbs from being jabbed by their needles  while sewing. The earliest metal thimbles date to the Han Dynasty (206 BC &ndash; 202  CE) in ancient China.&nbsp;&nbsp;  In medieval Europe, thimbles were made from  thick leather, bone, and ivory, in addition to metals such as brass.&nbsp; In  the 1700&rsquo;s, silver thimbles were a popular gift for ladies in America.&nbsp;  While thimbles may be very plain or covered with small geometric designs, they  can also be very elaborate with engraved pictures and initials. Sarah&rsquo;s thimble  is very rusty, having been buried in the ground for so many years, but it  appears to be simple in design.<span class="blue"><em></em></span></p>

 <p class="blue">Both  straight pins and safety pins were found at the farm. Straight pins were used  to pin clothes while sewing. Safety pins were used for fastening diapers and other  clothing.&nbsp; The modern safety pin was patented by an  American mechanic named Walter Hunt in 1849.&nbsp; Hunt used an 8-inch piece of  brass wire and designed a coil in the center so the pin would &ldquo;spring&rdquo; open.  There is a clasp at one end to shield the wearer from the sharp point. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Velcro and zippers, so popular in clothing today, are inventions of the 20th  century and make our lives easier. In the 1800&rsquo;s, clothing was fastened with  ties or laces, small metal hooks, and most frequently, with buttons. Sewing  these tiny items onto clothing was time consuming for the seamstress.</p>
  
    Nearly 450 buttons were uncovered during the excavation of the Williams&rsquo;  farmstead. They include a wide variety of styles, sizes and materials. Some  were cut from bone or shell. Some were made of metal, glass or hard rubber.  Some are small, about 3/8 inch in diameter, and plain in design; these were  commonly used on men&rsquo;s shirts. A few of the buttons are of bright colors or  have engraved designs, such as sunbursts, flowers, and swirls. These fancier buttons  probably added a stylish touch to clothing worn to church or for special  occasions. </p>

 <p class="blue">Hook  and eye enclosures, measuring less that a half inch, were often used on the  neckline and the cuffs of dresses.&nbsp; They could also be sewn one after the  other in a very closely spaced line down the back of a dress to join the fabric  like a step-by-step version of a zipper. &nbsp;&nbsp;Catalogues from the late  1800&rsquo;s advertise hooks and eyes, 2 dozen to a card, in black and silver.</p>

    The  brass buckles shown here are from suspenders used to hold up men&rsquo;s trousers.&nbsp; The buckle at top left is stamped with the  patent date of 1890, and matches the patent drawing showing the mechanism of  the buckle. Many times archeologists consult historical catalogues and patent  documents to help identify the artifacts they find.. </p>
