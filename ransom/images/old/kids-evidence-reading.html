	  <p class="whatsstyle">In the 1800s, many children learned to write using slates and slate pencils.   Because paper and pencils were relatively expensive, students often did their daily classwork and practiced skills such as handwriting and math on a framed piece of black slate., known as a slate table.    The teacher or an older child would check the work, then the student could erase the assignment and begin the next one.  </p>
	  
  <p class="whatsstyle">Archeologist found two large pieces of broken writing slates  and several pieces of slate pencils at the farm. One of the slate fragments has some symbols on it that were engraved with a knife blade or other sharp-pointed object.  Slate pencils  were made of a soft rock like talc or soapstone  to practice writing. </p>    </td>

These  writing utensils  are more familiar to modern school kids.  One specimen  has its original gum eraser and part of the wooden pencil still encased within the ferrule. Another type of writing tool found at the farm were carbon battery rods that had been sharpened on both ends. These may have worked just like pencils, leaving a heavy black mark on surfaces.</p></td>

Archeologists found a variety of lamp parts at the farm site, including  the burner mechanisms. These  sections rested on top of the  base that held the kerosene or other oil that was burned to make light. These pieces probably came from a lantern that once had a glass globe held in place by a metal frame.  No rural homes had electricity in the late 1800’s, so lanterns were the only source of light in the evening. </p> </td>
