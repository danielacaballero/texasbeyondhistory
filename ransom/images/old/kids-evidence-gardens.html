	<p><img src="kids-dr-dirt-farming.jpg" width="300" height="264" align="left"><span class="whatsstyle">The Williams farm must have been a very busy operation! Archeologists found many types of tools used for gardening and farming in the fields.  While some work had to be done by hand, other work was done with machinery, such as a plow pulled by horses and mules. </span></p>
 
    <span class="whatsstyle">Specific tools related to farming and gardening include a set of pruning shears, the blades of two garden hoes, and a heavily worn pick-mattock. These items likely saw a variety of uses on the farm, from digging up rocks and tree roots, to preparing the garden bed and tending vegetables. We also can imagine that Sarah might have wanted some roses or other flowers planted near the house.  
    </p>
	</span>
    <p class="whatsstyle">The pick mattock is a very handy tool that combines the pointed head of a pick, used for digging up hard soil and rock, and an adze, which can be used for cutting through roots.   Ransom Williams and his sons probably used the pick mattock to clear the higher ground on their property for farming.  </p>	</td>

	  <p class="whatsstyle">The archeologists identified the rusted pick mattock found at the farm in an 1873 tool catalogue, based on the name, "Hunt," which was stamped on the tool.  It was manufactured by the Douglas Axe Manufacturing Company in Massachusetts.</p>
	  <p class="whatsstyle">&nbsp;</p>
	  
  <p class="whatsstyle">In order to till the land, some form of plow was needed.  Archeologists found a piece of a plow called a jointer blade.  In order to attach the farm machinery to the horse or mule, a clevis was used; in this case a clevis pin wrench. This multifunctional tool was used to tighten various nuts and bolts on the machinery.  Other tool parts found at the farm were from a scale used to weigh crops, such as cotton. </p>
  <p class="whatsstyle">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="whatsstyle">&nbsp;</p> 
  <p class="whatsstyle">The Williams men probably cut a number of trees on the farm, using some of the wood to build their cabin.  They also needed a steady supply of firewood for cooking and heating the cabin. For these tasks they needed a strong axe. Archeologists found a steel axe head at the farm, but its butt end was split open and battered from heavy use. Although its main function was as an axe,  it also had been used as a wedge for splitting wood or prying out rocks to be used in fences. </p>

	<p class="whatsstyle">Any tools with an edge, such as axes and hoes, would wear down after frequent use and need to be sharpened.  Ransom Williams purchased a large grindstone fixture to sharpen his tools. The tool consisted of a large stone wheel that would spin when the machine was turned with the hand crank. To sharpen a tool, the blade was placed against the stone wheel as it turned.  The archeologists found almost all the pieces of this tool, except for the stone grinding wheel.</p>
