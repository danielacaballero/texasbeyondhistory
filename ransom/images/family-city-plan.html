      <p align="center"><strong><em>A City Plan for Austin</em>,  1928</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Racial segregation and discriminatory laws were still a fact of life for  African Americans in the South for more than a century after emancipation.  Those who left the rural farming life for the cities in the early twentieth  century still could not escape it. For many years, the white leaders in the  city of Austin  debated how to deal with the negro population. In 1928, an engineering firm  working for the city came up with a solution that was published as the <em>City Plan for Austin, Texas</em>. This  historical document reinforces the degree of racial discrimination that existed  in Texas and  across the South. The authors of the <em>City  Plan</em> noted that &ldquo;negroes&rdquo; lived in small numbers all over the city but were  most concentrated in a specific area of east Austin. They decided that this area should be  established as the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;negro district.&rdquo;&nbsp;  They would then encourage all the negroes in the city to move there,  which would help the city&rsquo;s budget because they would not have to provide  separate facilities for African Americans in other parts of town. Page 57 of  the <em>City Plan</em> states:&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">&hellip;<em>It is our recommendation that the nearest  approach to the solution of the race segregation problem will be the  recommendation of this district as a negro district; and that all the  facilities and conveniences be provided the negroes in this district, as an  incentive to draw the negro population to this area. This will eliminate the  necessity of duplication of white and black schools, white and black parks, and  other duplicate facilities for this area.</em></p>
