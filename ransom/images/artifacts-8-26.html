    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" --><p>Archival and archeological evidence indicate that Ransom Williams worked in the business of horses, either raising them, training them, or possibly both. Tax records show that Ransom consistently owned some horses and mules and at least one wagon during all three decades that he farmed the land. Between 1870 to 1873, he owned between 6 and 9 horses and mules, which was more than most of his neighbors, and he owned 1 or 2 horses or mules almost every year after that. The sheer number of horse-related artifacts recovered from the farmstead is impressive. Not only were horses an important mode of transportation, they were clearly used as beasts of burden to pull the plows and wagons he owned. Horse-labor may also have been a source of outside income if Williams used his wagons to haul freight for others. </p>

<p>This image shows an assortment of harness and bridle buckles (a), saddle cinch rings (b, c, d), and bridle bits (e, f). One of the items is part of a decorated snaffle bit (e) that has an elaborate shield-star-stripes motif indicative of American pride and patriotism.
