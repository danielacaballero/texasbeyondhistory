        </strong>
      </div>
      <p>Permanent, stable freedmen&rsquo;s colonies were based on  ownership of land within the community. To freedmen, land represented self-determination and an  ability to provide for themselves and their families rather than return to  virtual servitude as sharecroppers or tenant farmers under their former slavemasters. The mere acquisition of land by men and women who could not read or  write and who were emancipated with few possessions beyond the clothes on their  backs was no small achievement. Some were assisted by their former masters, but  most worked at odd jobs or as farm laborers for several years before they saved  enough money to buy small parcels of land. In some Texas counties, potential landowners were  hampered by laws that specifically prevented land sales to blacks.</p>
      <p>Despite such obstacles, nearly  one-fourth of African American farmers in the south succeeded in buying their  own land between 1870 and 1890. In Texas,  the increase in landownership among freedmen was extraordinary; in 1870, five years  out of slavery, only 1.8 percent of the state&rsquo;s black farmers owned land, but  by 1890, an amazing 26 percent achieved landownership. Black landownership in Texas continued to  increase and peaked at 31 percent just after the turn of the century; it then  remained relatively stable through 1920. </p>
      <p>These two graphs depict trends in  the percentage of black landowners in Texas  based on data from Loren Schweninger&rsquo;s  (1997) book: <em>Black Property Owners in the  South, 1790&ndash;1915</em> (noting that no data were available for 1880 in the  sources he used). The top graph shows the total number of black  landowners in Texas,  which rose steadily from 1870 to 1920, and then began a downward slide and  plummeted after 1950. The bottom graph shows the percentage of black landowners  out of all black farmers and planters, which included renters, tenants,  sharecroppers, and wage laborers. Agricultural census evidence shows that  between 20 and 30 percent of black farmers were landowners from 1900 through  1930, and this percentage rose dramatically over the next four decades. These  two graphs display reverse trends that are a reflection of one significant  phenomenon&mdash;the Great Migration. It began in the late nineteenth century as  rural blacks abandoned their farm-related jobs to move to the cities and out of  the South. This migration exploded in the twentieth century as conditions got  worse for blacks in the Jim Crow South. As the overall numbers of black  landowners decreased, the percentage of landowners within the total black  farmers and planters increased (while the actual numbers did not). Quite  simply, black landowners had a reason to stay on the land and maintain their  farms, while poor tenant farmers and laborers did not.</p>
