    <td><p>It  cannot be stated with absolute certainty where the main entrance to the house  was located  nor how many doors the dwelling may have had, but circumstantial evidence  indicates that it  probably had only one door on the south side sheltered by a front porch or other type of overhang. In his 1978 book on Texas log  homes, cultural geographer Terry Jordan describes single-pen, or single-room, log homes in  detail and provides the evidence for what the Williamses&rsquo; log house probably  looked like.</p>
      <p>First,  the rock chimney was located on the east side of the Williamses&rsquo; house, and  almost all single-pen  log houses in Texas had a gabled roof with the chimney on one of the gable  ends. Almost  all single pen log houses in Texas also had side-facing gables relative to a  single doorway, and  front porches with long overhanging eves were common. The single door was a  practical matter,  because having a second entrance would effectively remove too much of the  usable floor space  inside a small dwelling. The doorway was generally centered on one wall if the  log house was  square or nearly square, but the door was often offset on one long wall in  rectangular single pens.  This means that the Williams log home probably had a single door centered on  the north or south  side.</p>
      <p>Prevailing  winds in Travis County are southerly throughout the year, and it would have been important to take advantage of the  breeze during  the hot Texas summers. Conversely, the arctic cold fronts that often hit  central Texas in the  winter months produce bitterly cold, north winds. For these reasons, it is  likely that the door of  the Williamses&rsquo; log house would have been on the south side. Additional  circumstantial evidence  for a southern entrance is that the most concentrated portion of the trash midden is  located only  29 to 43 ft (9 to 13 m) east of the southeast corner of the house. Rather than  walking all the way  around the house from the west or north side, it is logical to assume that one  would walk out of  the south-facing doorway and turn left for the shortest walk to the east edge  of the yard to throw  out their garbage.      </p>
    <p>From  the inferred south wall of the Williamses&rsquo; log house, it is notable that  another east-west line  of rocks was present about 4 feet away, south of and parallel to the south  wall. If the door  was located in the center of the south wall as suspected, this second alignment  of stones probably  represents a line of foundation rocks skirting the south edge of a front porch.  If the house  was a single-pen log cabin and the family lived there for more than 30 years,  it seems almost  certain that it would have had a long overhanging eve and a front porch on the  south side of  the dwelling. Most of the small square and rectangular single-pen log cabins in  Texas illustrated  by Jordan had  substantial overhanging  eves or covered porches. </p></td>
