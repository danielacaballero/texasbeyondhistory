    <div class="caption">Fourth Annual Report of the Agricultural Bureau of Texas, published in 1892 for the agricultural year 1890–1891. At this time, agriculture in Texas was overseen by the Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History, and the annual reports provide a wealth of historical data on livestock and crops production, economics, and general information for all the counties and cities in the state, along with descriptions of mineral resources, public lands, and state-run facilities and universities. This report can be accessed online through Google Books. </div></td>
	<td width="448" class="text"><p>Archeological evidence from the farmstead, including findings of charred corn kernels and a corn-shelling tool, indicates that the family used some of the corn they grew. However, most other farmers in the area produced some amount of surplus corn for sale as a cash crop, and Ransom Williams probably did too.</p>
	  <p>Williams&rsquo; 45-acre farm included 18.5  acres of improved lands under cultivation and 26.5 acres of forested,  unimproved land that was used as livestock pasture. Using agricultural census  data for the freedmen farmers in nearby Antioch Colony in 1880, we may make an  educated guess regarding Williams&rsquo; crop production. If he intended for cotton  to be his main source of outside income, it is surmised that Williams may have  allocated his cultivated land as follows:</p>
	  <p>10.5 acres of cotton (57  percent) <br>
        7  acres of corn (38 percent)<br>
    1  acre devoted to the house and garden (5 percent)</p>	  <p>In this scenario, all of  Ransom&rsquo;s cotton was a cash crop (sold in 500-lb bales), and we can speculate  that about one half of his corn crop (sold by the bushel) would have been used  by the family or as supplemental livestock feed, leaving the other half as a  cash crop. The next step was to look at crop productivity per acre, and we used  the 1880 agricultural census data for this comparison. We compared the crop  productivity for seven average freedmen farmers in Antioch Colony, located  about 4 miles from the Williams farm, and for seven average white farmers in the  Bear Creek area, including Ransom Williams&rsquo; closest neighbors. These two  communities were quite similar in terms of the crops and livestock they raised,  total farm size and productivity, and total land and produce value. The level  of </p></td>

      <p>production on the Williams farmstead would certainly have varied from year  to year, with drought years being the least productive. However, using the average productivity data for Williams’ farming neighbors in 1880 does provide a reasonable proxy for what Williams was doing on his farm in the 1880s and 1890s. The 1880 crop yields per  acre for the Antioch Colony and Bear Creek farmers were as follows:</p>
      <p><strong>COTTON:&nbsp;</strong> Average yield was 0.3 bales/acre for both  Antioch Colony and Bear Creek<br>
      <strong>CORN:</strong>&nbsp; Average yield was 11.2 bushels/acre for  Antioch Colony and to 12.5 bushels/acre for Bear Creek      
<p>We then calculated the productivity  of cotton and corn on the Williams farmstead as follows: </p>
      <p><strong>COTTON:</strong>&nbsp; 10.5 acres x  0.3 bales/acre =&nbsp; 3.15 bales produced<br>
        <strong>CORN</strong>:&nbsp; 7 acres x 11.2  to 12.5 bushels/acre =&nbsp; 78.4 to 87.5  bushels produced</p>
      <p>We then used the 1890&ndash;1891 Texas  Agricultural Bureau report to calculate crop prices as follows:<br>
        <strong>COTTON:</strong><br>
        Hays County  = $50.04 per bale<br>
      Travis County  = $43.83 per bale</p>
      <p><strong>CORN:</strong><br>
        Hays County  = $0.51 per bushel<br>
      Travis County  = $0.98 per bushel</p>
      <p>The final step in this exercise was  estimating the total sales price for all the cotton and surplus corn that  Ransom Williams produced annually. Although we do not know the exact place(s)  where Ransom would have sold his cotton and corn in the 1880s and 1890s, he  undoubtedly would have sold it locally in Travis or Hays Counties.  Living so close to the county line, Ransom probably had equal access to markets  in both counties, and he would likely have sold his produce wherever he could  get the highest price in any given year. The estimated total amount of income  from Ransom Williams&rsquo; cash crops is as follows:</p>
      <p><strong>COTTON</strong>:&nbsp; Sale  of 3.15 bales of cotton at $43.83 &nbsp;to $50.04 per bale = $138.06 to $157.26<br>
        <strong>CORN</strong>:&nbsp; Sale  of 33.6 to 43.8 bushels (one half of total corn produced) <br>
      at  $0.51 to $0.98 per bushel = $17.14 to $42.92      
<p>This mathematical exercise leads us  to the following conclusion: If the Williams farmstead operation was similar to  that of his fellow freedmen in Antioch Colony and his white neighbors in the  Bear Creek area, Ransom Williams could have made between $155.20 and $200.18  annually from the production and sale of cash crops in a good year. We can  imagine that as much as one-half to three-quarters of this annual income was  spent on consumable goods (such as food, medicine, tobacco, ammunition),  durable goods (cloth and buttons for making work clothes, farm tools, equipment   and parts), and other necessities. The remaining money, which could be  as little as $38.80 and as much as $100.09,  was discretionary money. The  calculations above do not take into account any additional forms of income from  outside works or odd jobs performed by Ransom, Sarah, or any of the children.  Ransom may have used his wagon to deliver water to his neighbors, worked as a  farrier, or made  some extra cash repairing firearms. Sarah could have brought in  some cash as a seamstress, doing small sewing jobs for neighbors or friends at  church. During the cotton or corn harvest, any of the family members could have  hired on to help local farmers bring in their crops.</p>
    <p>The discretionary money represents  the net profit that Ransom and Sarah Williams made from their successful  farming operation after subtracting their operating expenses and essential  purchases. This extra money, perhaps as much as $100 in a good farming year,  represented a significant amount of buying power in the late nineteenth century.  For Ransom and Sarah Williams, it represented the ability to purchase a few  luxuries for themselves and their children, and a chance for them to participate  in the great American dream. </p></td>
