	<td width="448" class="text"><p>Wilkie  observed that crystals and dart points were &ldquo;religiously and magically  important artifacts&rdquo; that were found in yard areas and underneath houses at the  Riverlake Plantation in Louisiana.  Projectile points and other Native American chipped stone tools also were recovered  from the Levi Jordan quarters, which housed the enslaved and freedmen community  at a plantation in Brazoria County,   Texas. These artifacts were  recovered from contexts that suggested they might have had ritual functions.</p>
	  <p>At the Hermitage Plantation near Nashville, Tennessee,  15 artifacts found in one of the slave cabins included several broken  projectile points. Archeologist Aaron Russell stated that &ldquo;The recovery of  prehistoric artifacts in African-American contexts at the Hermitage raises the  possibility that enslaved African Americans were actively collecting and using  them for some purpose.&rdquo; He also notes that African Americans may have used the  projectile points as strike-a-lights for starting fires. </p>
	  <p>One ethnographic  account suggests an unusual connection between arrowheads, fire-making, and  ritual charms. In the 1926 classic, <em>Folk Beliefs of the Southern Negro</em>, Newbell  Niles Puckett reported: &quot;One old conjure-doctor in Mississippi told me that the Indian  arrowheads often found in the locality were not made by man at all, but were  fashioned by God out of thunder and lightning.&quot; </p>

  <tr> 
    <td class="text"><p><em> To use one for good luck, strike  a spark from it with your knife (if the sparks fly readily you will know that  you have a good knife) and let the spark fall upon a piece of powdered punk.  Let the punk smoulder into ashes, which are to be wrapped in a piece of  newspaper and carried with you always for good luck.</em></p>
      <p>This oral testimony suggests a direct connection between  projectile points, the creation of fire, and conjuring for bringing good luck,  so a link between hearths and projectile would be a logical extension of this  spiritual connection. In this case, the flint arrowhead was not the charm.  Rather, it was a powerful tool used to make the ashes that were carried as a charm.</p>
      <p>The link between hearths and ritual activities is  strongly evidenced in African American archeological contexts. At the  Ashland-Belle Helene Plantation in Louisiana,  for example, archeologists observed: &ldquo;The coin, beads, shells, buttons,  and smoothed stones were found more frequently near hearths than in other parts  of the cabins or in the yards.&rdquo; They suggest that this may reflect ritual  activity centered on the hearth and that such a ritual would take place  within the house where it could be hidden. </p></td>
