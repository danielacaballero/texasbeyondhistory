      <div class="text">Headstone  of Will E. and Clara Williams. Born in 1876, Will was the oldest  son of Ransom and Sarah Williams, and he married Clara Franklin in 1901. The  couple lived for many years near Clara&rsquo;s family in the small community of  Creedmoor in southern Travis County, but they eventually moved to east Austin and lived in a  house on East 19th Street,  now Martin Luther King Blvd.  Will and Clara had eight children. One of their boys, Arnold, eventually  married Novella Harris, and the couple settled in the house next door where  they raised five children of their own. As part of the oral history research on  the Williams farmstead, we interviewed three of Arnold and Novella&rsquo;s daughters, who are great  granddaughters of Ransom and Sarah Williams&mdash;Corrine Harris, Lourice Johnson,  and Jewel Andrews. They all had fond memories of Will and Clara, and they  recalled the many farm animals that their grandparents kept. Apparently, Will  and Clara brought a little of the farm life to the city when they came to Austin.<u></u> Will died in 1954 at the age of 78, and Clara Williams died in 1977 at the age of 103. They are buried  next to each other in the Evergreen Cemetery in east Austin, less than half-a-mile from the house  where they lived on East 19th    Street.<strong></strong></div>
