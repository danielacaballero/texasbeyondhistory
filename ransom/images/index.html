  <p>Although U.S. President Abraham Lincoln  issued his Emancipation Proclamation in January, 1863, African-American slaves  in Texas  would have to wait two and one-half more years before gaining their freedom.  News of emancipation came to Texas  on June 19, 1865, and it spread across the state over the next several months. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;We can only imagine how Ransom Williams and  Sarah Houston felt when they learned that they were now free&mdash;that they were no  longer someone else&rsquo;s property. Ten years later, they would be married, living  on a farm that Ransom had bought in Travis  County just south of Austin, and starting their own family. The  couple would see many changes in their lives during the late nineteenth century  and into the twentieth century as they transitioned from being enslaved to  being free Americans. For newly freed blacks, legal emancipation was only the  beginning of a long journey toward actual freedom and equality. It was a  journey that would take many generations. </p>
  <p>Evidence suggests that Ransom  Williams had been a slave of the Bunton family who came to Texas  from Kentucky and started a plantation at Mountain City,  near Buda in Hays   County.&nbsp; It is possible that Ransom took the Bunton  family name, but later changed his last name to &ldquo;Williams.&rdquo;&nbsp; He bought his 45-acre farm in Travis County  in 1871, and married Sarah Houston in 1875.&nbsp;  The couple had nine children over the next two decades.&nbsp; Ransom died in 1901, but Sarah and some of  the children continued to live on the farm until about 1905, when they moved to  the well-established African American community in East   Austin.&nbsp; It is clear that  someone, probably renters, continued to use the Williams farmland for  agricultural purposes after that, but the historic and archeological evidence  indicate that no one actually lived on the property after ca. 1905. <strong></strong></p>
    <h3><strong>Significance:  A Rare Perspective on Texas  History</strong></h3>
    <p>This small, hardscrabble farm near  Bear Creek was home to the Williams family during the post-Civil War  reconstruction and well into the Jim Crow era, when discrimination against  blacks was encoded into state laws across the South. Ransom Williams purchased his  45 acres in a time when only a small percentage of blacks could afford any land  at all. He and Sarah were both illiterate, but as parents they made sure their  children attended school and practiced reading and writing at home. The vast  array of artifacts recovered from their farmstead show that the Williams family  prospered while many other blacks were struggling as low-wage laborers or  falling into the oppressive system of tenant farming or sharecropping for white  landlords. The Williams family lived within a rural white farming community,  yet they managed to avoid the racial violence that was a very real threat for  all blacks during the Jim Crow era. </p>
    <p>Documented archeological sites known  to represent freedmen farmsteads are extremely rare. Rarer still are sites that  have been thoroughly investigated through archival research and oral history  interviews, as well as through archeological excavations. While there are a few  of these in the state, the Williams farmstead stands alone in its high degree  of archeological integrity. The farmstead is relatively pristine, from an  archeological perspective. Virtually all of the structural remains and  artifacts on the site were created or used by the Williams family, and there  were minimal disturbances to the site after the family left the property.</p>
    <p>While one can find countless books,  chapters, and articles written about white farmers and farm families all across  Texas,  comprehensive stories of post-emancipation freedmen farmers in the state are  few and far between. The Williams Farmstead Archeological Project is the most intensive  archeological and historical investigation ever attempted for an African  American-owned farmstead in Texas  The project has illuminated a comprehensive and detailed story of one African  American family during its transition from slavery to freedom. </p>
    <h3><strong>It  All Started with a Toll Road </strong></h3>
    <p>A proposed toll road project in  southern Travis County provided the opportunity to  conduct an in-depth study of the post-emancipation transitions of African Americans  by investigating the historic farmstead owned by Ransom and Sarah Williams. The  investigations of this site were part of a multi-year, multidisciplinary,  historic archeological project sponsored by the Texas Department of  Transportation (TxDOT). The project was a collaborative effort between three  Austin-based groups. Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted the on-site  archeological investigations of the Williams farmstead, while Preservation Central,  Inc. carried out the historic archival research. The third component of the  project was the community outreach and oral history interviews with descendant  community members, and this work was performed by the Department of  Anthropology at the University   of Texas. <strong></strong></p>
    <p>Archeological field investigations  were conducted at the Williams farmstead site from 2007 through 2009.&nbsp;  It was   determined that the house site was relatively intact; the rock chimney and  large foundation stones delineated the approximate   location where a wooden  house had stood, and the work revealed intact   archeological deposits with numerous nineteenth-century artifacts. Around the house were  indications of a possible outbuilding,   a substantial trash dump, and   some old rock walls. </p>
    <p>When we looked at  the entire farmstead   property, rock alignments were found on the borders of the  property,   and large walls of stacked limestone rock fences were found along the    edges of a heavily wooded area downslope and north of the house. By studying vegetation patterns in comparison with historic and   modern aerial  photographs, we were able to  discern fields    that were cleared long ago as  well as areas that were left wooded to serve as   livestock pasture. </p>
    <p>The extensive work recovered over 26,000  artifacts and documented many household and farm features in a detailed  landscape analysis of the property.&nbsp; The  community outreach and voluminous oral histories (more than 39 hours of  audiotaped and fully transcribed interviews) bridge a gap between the Williams  family on the farm in the late nineteenth century and their descendants living  in East Austin today. These narratives  correspond with the farmstead material culture in many ways, and they provide a  unique African American perspective on the rural farm life in central Texas. </p>
    <p>An additional avenue of research  that is somewhat rare for this type of &ldquo;cultural resource management&rdquo; project  was also conducted&mdash;a review of late nineteenth-century African American newspapers  housed in Austin  archives. The abundant advertisements for products and services helped us interpret  the farmstead artifacts, and the diverse editorials and news articles provide  yet another nineteenth-century African American perspective that cannot be  found anywhere else. </p>
    <h3><strong>Post-Emancipation  Transitions and African Diaspora Studies</strong></h3>
    <p>In time and space, the research  focus for the Williams farmstead archeological project is seemingly narrow. But  this small plot of land in central Texas,  owned and occupied by a single black family from 1871 to 1905, is part of a  much bigger story. &nbsp;They did not know it  at the time, but when the Williams family left the farm in 1905 they were  participants in the &ldquo;great migration.&rdquo; This was a widespread trend when many  black farmers sold off their small farms or left rural farming jobs to move to  cities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the Jim  Crow era, racial discrimination was codified into laws all across the southern  Untied States.&nbsp; Racial prejudice and fear  of violence were high on the list of reasons why many black farmers&mdash;including  landowners, tenants, sharecroppers and laborers&mdash;abandoned their rural homes and  moved to the larger cities in both the South and North.</p>
    <p>The investigation of the Williams  farmstead falls into the genre of African <em>diaspora</em> research, which is the greater effort to fully document and interpret the  movements of African peoples across the world through all time periods. To  understand why African diaspora studies are so important to Texas history, we must remember that  Euro-Americans wrote most of the state&rsquo;s history, and it is told from a  decidedly Anglo-European perspective. Much of Texas&rsquo; history has been written by and about  the white society that dominated the state&rsquo;s political, economic, and academic  realms throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Within this broader  historic context, the Williams farmstead represents a snapshot in time and  space within the larger story of the African Diaspora. </p>
    <p>Through archeology, historical archives,  and oral history, the Ransom and Sarah Williams farmstead project tells the  story of one African American family&rsquo;s transition from slavery to freedom. This  family&rsquo;s tenure on the land spans three decades after emancipation, a period  that is poorly represented in historic and archeological records in Texas and throughout the Southern   United States. While this project chronicles the life of a single  freedmen farm family in central Texas, in a  larger sense it represents thousands of other African American farm families  all across Texas  whose stories cannot be told.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3 align="left"><strong>In This Exhibit</strong></h3>
    <p>In the following sections, you can  learn the story of the Williams farmstead as revealed through archeology,  archival research, and oral histories. The <strong><a href="context.html" target="_blank">Historical  Context</a></strong> section provides background on slavery in Texas, the Reconstruction period, and the  early Jim Crow era.&nbsp; <strong><a href="settlement.html" target="_blank">Family and Community</a> </strong>traces the Williams family history  within the rural communities of Bear Creek, Rose Colony, and Antioch Colony in southern Travis and northern Hays   Counties.&nbsp; This section includes a Williams Family Tree, compiled with information and photos discovered during the project.</p>
    <p>The<a href="archeology.html" target="_blank"><strong> Archeology </strong></a>section details findings from landscape analysis and excavations using interactive  maps. The thousands of<strong> <a href="artifacts.html" target="_blank">Artifacts</a></strong> recovered from the  site link the Williams family to the American consumer culture of the late  nineteenth century, and these items are discussed in detail within a gallery of images.</p>
    <p><strong> <a href="life.html" target="_blank">Life on the Farmstead</a></strong> is reconstructed in three colorful scenes based on archeological and historical evidence recovered during the project. The <strong><a href="project.html" target="_blank">Oral History</a></strong> section summarizes the  descendant community outreach efforts and the oral history research as key  components of the Williams farmstead project. Online audio clips from the  interviews demonstrate strong links in the details of daily life between the  nineteenth-century farmstead archeology and the twentieth-century  recollections. </p>
    <p>The special section on <strong><a href="newspapers.html" target="_blank">19th-Century  African American Newspapers</a></strong> traces post-emancipation life in Central Texas in the news media, including the pivotal  role of the church and black businesses in education and racial issues.&nbsp; <strong><a href="transitions.html" target="_blank">Post-Emancipation  Transitions</a></strong> draws together the full range of project findings and examines  the experience of the Williams family within a broader context.</p>
    <p>The <strong><a href="kids-discover.html" target="_blank">Kids</a></strong> section features learning activities linking the  archeological and historical findings to life on the Williams farmstead. An interactive timeline for the 1870s-1890s coupled with  a population statistics activity provide stimulating learning challenges for slightly older students. &nbsp;The <strong><a href="teach.html" target="_blank">Teachers</a></strong> section includes curricula for 4th- and 7th-  grade students focused on African American life after slavery, the transition to  citizenship, and the importance of Freedom Communities. <strong><a href="credits.html" target="_blank">Credits and Sources</a></strong> acknowledges the organizations and people who  contributed to the Williams farmstead archeological project and this exhibit  and provides references and links to &nbsp;sources for additional information. </p></td>
