      <td width="480" valign="top"><p>The  artifact assemblage from the Williams farmstead is amazingly pristine from an  archeological perspective for several reasons. The site was occupied for a  relatively short period of time, about three decades, and the abandonment by  the Williams family was fairly rapid in the first decade of the twentieth  century. It also appears that the site experienced minimal disturbances after  its abandonment. </p>
        <p>This  unique combination of factors means that the entire artifact assemblage has an  excellent archeological context, and its association with the Williams family  is very strong. Among the thousands of artifacts, there are only a few that  post-date the Williams occupation, but even these can be easily explained. For  example, fragments of two glass bottles came from wine bottles manufactured  after 1913, but these were all concentrated along one of the rock walls where  someone was using them for firearms target practice after the Williamses had  moved off the property. Another out of place artifact is a 1941 coin that was  probably dropped by someone who visited. Even though the Williams family had  moved off the property by 1905, they continued to farm the land or lease out  the property, so someone was still coming to the old homestead.</p>
        <p>This type of contextually discrete  assemblage can provide a wealth of information about the daily lives they  experienced on the family farm. But the artifacts cannot speak for themselves  and will not  reveal their stories without some coaxing. In order to  interpret the material remains, archeologists must identify, classify, and  study the artifacts in many different ways. </p>
        <h3>Classification by Function</h3>
        <p>The  classification scheme chosen by PAI archeologists for the Williams farmstead  analysis is essentially a modified version of the widely used functional  classification system developed by historical archeologist Stanley South   in the 1970s.&nbsp; The Williams farmstead classification scheme is presented in  its entirety to show the comprehensive scope of the entire collection. This  scheme employs ten main groups, with five key functional categories: Architectural, Kitchen and Household, Activities, Clothing and Adornment,  and Personal. Within each major category, artifacts are further classified in  subgroups and then specific artifact types.</p>
        <p>However, any classification scheme used to analyze  material culture has certain strengths and weaknesses. This type of  classification system is based on the original intended function for which each  item was manufactured, and one of its strengths is that most items were indeed  used for their originally intended purposes. The scheme does allow for items to  have multifunctional uses, such as a pocketknife that had an unlimited range of  potential uses. How it was actually used depended upon who owned it, and in  this classification scheme pocketknives are classified as personal items  without reference to the many ways they were probably used.</p>
        <p>When this classification system is  employed in its strictest form, however, it does not adequately address the  reuse of objects, which was and still is a common human behavior, or complex  contexts where items were used in unusual ways. Any object will have a primary  function, which is its original intended function, but it may also have many  secondary functions, reflecting various ways in which items were recycled and  reused. It is also acknowledged that many objects found on a farm may never  have been used for their primary function and only been used in various  secondary functions.</p>
        <p>
          A few examples will illustrate how  complex it is to understand the primary and secondary functions of many items,  and to show how their contexts or attributes can sometimes reveal their  functions. A steel axe head was found at the farm, but its butt end was split  open and battered from heavy use. Its primary function was as an axe, but its  secondary function was its use as a wedge for splitting wood. Once it broke, it  was considered useless and discarded into the trash midden. </p>
        <p>
          A long section of twisted metal  rod, threaded on one end, was originally manufactured as a lightning rod, a  safety device that could be installed on a house or barn. But only one section  of lightning rod was recovered, and we found no clips to attach rods to a  structure. This suggests that the lightning rod section was probably salvaged  elsewhere and brought to the farm to be used in other ways, such as a pry-bar  or a tether stake for securing an animal.        </p>
        <p>
          A carbon rod from a dry-cell  battery has a specific primary function to generate a direct electrical  current, but the two specimens found at the Williams farmstead had their ends  sharpened. We don&rsquo;t know if the Williamses had some device that used a dry cell  battery, perhaps a flashlight such as the &ldquo;Electric Search Light&rdquo; advertised  with the dry-cell batteries in the 1902 Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company catalog. In  any case, we surmised that the battery carbon rods were sharpened to function  as writing implements.</p>
        <h3>Rules, Exceptions, and Unknowables</h3>
        <p>The pie graph  at right  shows the relative  frequencies of the functional classification groups of artifacts recovered from the Williams  farmstead. The numbers of specimens in these groups vary widely, from 86 items  in the Botanical and the Unknown-Unidentifiable groups to 11,965 items in the  Kitchen and Household group. This graph also illustrates  an important  point&mdash;not all of the classification groupings are equally important for  interpretive purposes. The most important groups for analyzing the historic  artifacts are the five main functional groups&mdash;Architectural, Kitchen and  Household, Activities, Clothing and Adornment, and Personal. Collectively,  these groups comprise 70.2 percent of the total artifact assemblage and include all of the  man-made artifacts that are most useful for interpreting the historic  activities and behaviors that created the site.        </p>
        <p>
          Two points are worth noting about these groups. First,  to be consistent in the classification of thousands of artifacts, a set of  rules was established to govern which items belonged in which functional groups.  Second, there were exceptions to these rules. There were quite a few cases where  an artifact was classified into a particular group based on its archeological  context rather than its simplest identification based on its primary function.  </p>
        <p>The faunal and botanical remains  are not artifacts per se. These groups contain the animal bones and plant  fragments that survived, and many of the specimens were indeed modified by  people. Most of the plant remains are charred, and whether they were burned  intentionally or accidentally, it was the burning that enabled them to survive.  Some of the plants are charred woods used as fuel, while others are charred  remains of foods that were consumed by the Williamses. Similarly, butchering  marks and spiral fractures on many animal bones indicate that certain species  were being killed and eaten, while some other bones only represent critters  that lived around the farmstead and died of natural causes. The animal and  plant remains are important evidence, indeed, but these groups combined only  represent 11 percent of the recovered materials.</p>
        <p>Of the categories shown in the chart at top, three are  excluded from further consideration in this online exhibit because they are really not that important  for interpretive purposes. A small handful of items (n=86) are classified as  Unknown-Possibly identifiable; these are mostly fragmentary specimens that have not  been identified but perhaps can be in the future.  More than 4,000 specimens are in the  Unknown-Unidentifiable group, and these are dominated by small rusted pieces of  iron. These are too corroded and too fragmentary to ever be identified, and  they have little or no interpretive value. The last group is the chipped lithic  artifacts, and it includes 784 specimens. These are mainly chert flakes and  some core and tool fragments that were found in the excavation units but were  not deposited or used by the Williams family. These chipped stone items are  associated with a large, low-density prehistoric lithic scatter that covers  most of the old farmstead. These artifacts provide evidence that Native  Americans once used the land, but this whole category is not important for  understanding the Williams farmstead. </p>
        <p>Having said this, there is one notable  exception in the lithic category. A prehistoric dart point was found in the chimney firebox, and its  context clearly indicates that it was picked up and placed there by someone who  built the chimney. As such, this dart point represents an unusual historic  activity, and rather than being lumped in with the unassociated lithics it was  classified as a collectible in the Personal artifact group. A fragmentary arrow  point also was found in the yard, and we will never know if its occurrence was  fortuitous or if it was picked up and brought there by one of the Williams  children.</p>
        <p>Of the total assemblage, 18,742  artifacts are classified into the five main functional groups, and these are  the specimens of prime  interest for interpreting the daily activities and rural  life on the Williams family farm. But since these numbers can be misleading, a few  words of explanation are needed here.&nbsp;  First, whenever possible, each artifact was classified into one of the  functional groups whether it was whole or only a fragment. For example, a nail  fragment gets counted as one artifact just as a whole nail would be. One  artifact might be a complete dinner fork, while another might be a single tine  off of a fork. An entire cast iron cooking stove might be  represented by only a leg section and fragments of its body and burner plates.  This problem is unavoidable, however, since most artifacts that end up in a  historic archeological site are actually fragments of much larger items. It is  easy to see how the specimen numbers can become quite large depending on how  objects were broken and dispersed within the site. This is particularly true of  fragile items like ceramic vessels and glass bottles. <br>
          </p>
        <p>With one glance at the artifact graph (above right), the  Kitchen and Household group stands out because it contains many more  artifacts that the other functional groups. This impression is misleading  because the large number of glass fragments and ceramic sherds skew the data. In a  nutshell, the Kitchen and Household group contains more fragments of fragile  items than do all the other categories.&nbsp;        </p>
        <p>In the rest of this exhibit section, it would be  impossible to describe every type of artifact that was found due to the sheer  size of the collection. For this reason, only selected groupings of artifacts  are illustrated and discussed as being most representative of each of the five  functional categories. </p></td>
