    <p>The single most compelling artifact related to Ransom Williams' connection with horses came in the form of a fragment from a branding iron. A single letter "R" was found near the house, and the broken shank on one side leaves no doubt that it was from a livestock brand. The style of the "R" matches the "RA" that Ransom registered as his "Horse Brand" with Travis County in April 1872.  The orientation of the letter is most intriguing, however. Based on how the shank was once attached, the letter "R" would have been burned backwards into the horse's hide. We suspect that this was a mistake by a blacksmith, and when it was discovered the backward "R" had to be removed and a new correct one was made and attached to the brand shank. Ransom may have saved the original letter "R" as a keepsake.
