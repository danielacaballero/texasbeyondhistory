    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" --><p>One activity that would have  occurred regularly in and around the home was sewing, and this was particularly  important in a household with as many 9 to 11 people at any given time. Lost  buttons and torn clothing required repairs, and the Williamses also probably  made some clothes from new or recycled fabric, especially for the young  children. They may have also made and repaired bed sheets, pillow cases, window  curtains, etc. The use of quilts was common in the nineteenth century, and the  Williamses may have made and owned a variety of quilts made from scraps of  fabric salvaged from worn-out clothes.</p>
        <p>The sewing artifacts shown here are (a)  straight pins (used to pin clothes while sewing), (b) safety pins (used for  fastening diapers and other clothing), (c) scissors (for cutting fabric), and (d)  a thimble (used to protect a finger while pushing sewing needles). The first  safety pin was patented in 1849, and we recovered three types of safety pins  that date from the late 1800s, as shown in the two patent drawings from 1878  (e) and 1888 (f). </p>
