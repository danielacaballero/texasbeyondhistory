<p>Transfer-printed whiteware dishes also were common at the Williams farmstead, having been found around the house and in the trash midden. This image shows all four of the transfer ware vessels that were identified, and they all have a floral print design identified as Kenwood pattern manufactured in England by Alfred Meakin, Ltd. The globe mark seen on the plates was used by the Alfred Meakin pottery only between 1875 to 1897, but the word "England" indicates manufacture after the 1890 McKinley Tariff act required the country of origin be marked on all imported goods. The vessels in this photo are: (a) reconstructed plate with maker's mark; (b) reconstructed saucer with maker's mark;  (c) tea cup; and  (d) reconstructed tea cup.</p>
<p>
In addition to these four vessels, many other sherds with the same transfer-printed floral design were found, and these are probably from other plates, saucers, and cups. Some of the cup fragments had small loop finger handles. This evidence suggests that the Williams family probably purchased a complete set of English-made transfer-printed dinnerware  manufactured between ca. 1891 and 1897. The Kenwood pattern by the Alfred Meakin pottery was apparently popular in late nineteenth-century Texas because identical sherds were found at an Anglo farmstead in the Onion Creek area of Hays County (41HY53), and in two African American households (41HR1010) in Houston Freedmen's Town.
