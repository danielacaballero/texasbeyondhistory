      <p>In conjunction with the Williams  Farmstead Archeological project, some of the most important artifacts were sent  to the Conservation Research Laboratory, which is operated through Texas A&amp;M   University&rsquo;s Nautical  Archaeology Program. While they specialize in conserving artifacts from  shipwrecks and other underwater sites, they also provide commercial services to  conserve, stabilize, or restore artifacts from other types of sites. The  conservation process varies depending on the type of materials in each object,  but the intent is to halt deterioration and stabilize items to prevent their  destruction. The most vulnerable artifacts from historic  sites on land are  those made of iron and combination metals that  may continue to corrode  over time. Once iron artifacts begin to rust, for example, the natural chemical  processes that breakdown iron to iron oxide will continue unless something is  done to stop it. But if artifacts are properly conserved, the items are  completely stabilized for long-term curation and are suitable for museum  displays. </p>
      <p>Many of the artifacts from the  Ransom Williams farmstead were severely corroded from being buried in the  ground and subjected to natural elements, specifically, repeated wetting and drying. A sample of those  materials, including some of the most significant items in advanced stages of  deterioration, were processed by the Conservation Research Laboratory in 2013 and  2014. </p></td>
