    <p>Twenty-two vessels identified as whitewares have different kinds of decorations and finishes. The assemblage includes a variety of serving dishes, plates, bowls, cups and saucers, and specialized containers. The vessels in this image include (a) fragments of annular ware, an older style of ceramic that declined in popularity by the mid-nineteenth century;  (b) and (c) plain whiteware tea or coffee cups.  Specimen (d) is a teacup in Victorian majolica style (exterior and interior views shown). This majolica is a refined earthenware and should not be confused with the earlier tin-glazed majolicas. Victorian majolica became popular in America after the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, but it fell out of popularity and production ceased around the turn of the century. This particular piece has a bright pink interior slip with an embossed exterior brightly painted in green, light blue, and pink. The exterior design matches the "shell and seaweed" designs on many "Victorian majolica" and "Etruscan majolica" wares that were made in Europe and America in the last half of the 1800s.  Item (e)  is an embossed oval lid, possibly to a large casserole dish. The knobs on the handle are broken off.
