      <h2><strong>Racial Violence in the News during the Late 19th  Century</strong></h2>
      <p>Late nineteenth- and early  twentieth-century newspapers often included articles about the racial violence  that was becoming common in southern states during the Jim Crow era, but the  white newspapers often told a different story than the black newspapers. The <em>Austin Daily Statesman</em>, for example,  regularly noted instances of racial violence, including articles that  highlighted the lynching of black men and women, the forced expulsion of blacks  from towns, and the pending threat of violent retribution for actual or alleged  attack or murders. The prevalence of news stories about racial and sexual  violence, and a review of many articles in the white newspaper, the <em>Austin Daily Statesman,</em> suggests that  the white press played a significant role in perpetuating the myth of the black  &ldquo;rape fiend.&rdquo; The headlines of the articles<em>,</em> leave little doubt as to the biases of the white authors and editors in  incidents were blacks were accused of violence against whites: <br>
 <ul> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  Like Negro Ravishers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Incident in Kansas City, Kansas. <br>
  <em>Austin Daily Statesman</em>, April 13, 1893</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Shot  and Burned a Murderer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Incident in Eufaula, Alabama. <br>
          <em>Austin Daily Statesman, </em>April 15, 1893</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Will  Hang for Rape&rdquo; Incident in Columbus,   South Carolina.<br>
          <em>Austin Daily Statesman</em>, April 15, 1893</ul></p>
      <br><p>These and other  articles offered little sympathy for those accused of a crime, rarely assessed  the validity of the evidence presented, and often omitted crucial facts  pertinent to the story. In many cases, white mob violence was seen as a  justifiable behavior when blacks were accused of violent crimes. Guilt was  assumed, and the white authors and editors refrained from expressing any  disgust or disdain for the total disregard for justice. Mob violence often  resulted in someone being lynched, or even more horrifying, being tied down and  burned to death. </p>
      <p><br>
        An October 15, 1894 article in the <em>Austin Daily Statesman</em> talked about a white mob lynching of a black  man accused of murder. The author stated: &ldquo;This is the eighth lynching in  central Kentucky  in six months and the people have determined to put a stop to murder if they  have to take the law into their hands every time a man is killed.&rdquo; These words  seem to condone the mob&rsquo;s violent behavior by suggesting that the they were  somehow administering justice.<br><br>
        An 1896 article in <em>The  Searchlight</em> is titled: &ldquo;Your Vote Can Check a Mob.&quot; The original newspaper  is torn, and the end of the article is missing. But the unknown author is  expressing the opinion that black voters can and should try to elect officials  who would help curb mob violence. Another 1896 <em>Searchlight </em>article is titled: &ldquo;Travesty Upon Justice.&rdquo; In it, the  newspaper&rsquo;s city editor, James H. Harrison, describes the lack of justice in  the murder of a black woman. She was shot and killed by a young white boy who  was upset because she owed him 25 cents. The injustice occurred when the boy&rsquo;s  actions were quickly ruled to be an accidental murder, and the charges were  dropped. At the end of the article, the author states:&nbsp; <br>
       &quot;The partial manner in which  the laws of our country are being administered is a burning disgrace to  christianity and civilization. Who can say that a Negro has equality before the  law in South Carolina, in Texas or the South? Not the city editor.&quot;
