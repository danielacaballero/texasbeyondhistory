      <p>Toys were important items because  Ransom and Sarah Williams had a total of nine children while they lived on the  farm. Their children were born over a period of 16 years, from 1876 to 1892, so  young children were always present on the farm for more than two decades. This  image shows a variety of toys that were found: (a) a cap gun with the word  &ldquo;CHIEF&rdquo; on one side;&nbsp; (b) marbles made of  clay and glass; (c)&nbsp; a hard rubber ball;  (d) ceramic doll fragments; and (e-f) ceramic fragments from different vessels  in a child&rsquo;s tea set. Generally speaking, cap guns, marbles, and rubber balls  tended to be boy&rsquo;s toys while dolls and tea sets were girl&rsquo;s toys. But  historical evidence and oral history interviews reveal that there was always a  great deal of overlap in the use of toys by young children. </p>
