    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" --><p>This image shows six items classified as collectibles. People pick up different hobbies throughout their lifetime, and collecting objects is one that most children try at some point. Such collecting may turn into lifelong pursuits for adults. Someone in the Williams household was in the habit of collecting unusual natural stones, such as the round quartz stone (upper left) and the round and cylindrical hematite nodules shown here. Geologically speaking, natural hematite nodules are not found in the immediate vicinity of the farm, and the quartz stone is probably nonlocal as well. While the quartz rock appears to be unmodified, each of the hematite nodules exhibits some degree of polishing and some may be shaped as well. Because most of them are relatively round, it is possible that these natural geofacts were collected by the Williams children  and intentionally modified to make them rounder so they would function as marbles.
