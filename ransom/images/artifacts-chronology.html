    <tr>
      <td width="480" valign="top"><p>Historical evidence indicates that  the Williams family lived on their farm from ca. 1871 to 1905, and the  recovered artifacts are indeed representative of this time frame. But the  process of interpreting the chronology of artifacts from a historic site is not  as easy as one might imagine. Identifying the timeframe of an occupation based  on a large artifact assemblage involves understanding the full life cycle of  individual artifacts. </p>
        <p>After an object is manufactured, it  is purchased or obtained by a consumer. The object may be used for a short  period of time, or a long period of time, and it may be modified and recycled  for some use other than its intended function. Ultimately, each object gets  broken and discarded, lost, or left behind so that it then enters the  archeological record. For historical archeologists, some items are good  chronological indicators because they represent a  distinctive type or have distinctive markings that can be dated. But in any given assemblage,  most of the items recovered are not particularly informative for chronological  assessment. Broken bottle glass, plain whiteware sherds, and rusted iron pieces  are the most common items found, and they are obviously of historic age.  Unfortunately, they cannot provide much additional chronological information,  and archeologists must focus their efforts on items that are temporally  sensitive. </p>
        <p>For the Williams farmstead material remains, the chronology must be  assessed based on the items that have diagnostic markings (such as maker&rsquo;s  marks, company or product names, or patent dates) or represent a class of  objects specific to a particular time period, such as cut or wire nails. Both types of evidence are useful  for evaluating the age of the farmstead material culture.</p>
        <p>For any historic site, we cannot  assume that the manufacture dates for any particular item represent the time  when that item was acquired, used, or discarded. The main problems with making  this assumption are: (1) Items with known beginning manufacturing dates could  have been made and purchased many years or even decades after their initial  appearance; (2) Items with known ending manufacture dates could have been made  for many years before they stopped being made; (3) Items with known beginning  and ending manufacture dates could have remained unsold in a wholesale or  retail store for many years or even decades; and (4) Items can be resold or  traded from one consumer to another years or decades after they were made.  </p>
        <p>Archeologists call this phenomenon the &ldquo;time lag&rdquo; effect, and it must be  considered when studying artifacts from any historic sites. Historic archeologist  William Hampton Adams defined time lag as &ldquo;the difference between the date of  manufacture and the date of deposition,&rdquo; noting that &ldquo;the manufacturing date  for an artifact cannot be equated with an artifact&rsquo;s use date.&rdquo; Adams summarized this concept succinctly when he said:  &ldquo;&hellip;it takes time for these objects to be broken and discarded.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>For nineteenth-century historic  sites, some time lag between manufacture and deposition should be expected for  almost all artifact categories, but the degree of time lag will vary by  artifact types. A site occupied only for one year in 1895, for example, would  probably have relatively few items made in the 1890s but many items made in the  1880s and 1870s. The average time lag for many fragile items (glass containers  and ceramic dishes) might be a few years, while the lifespan of many durable  items (hand tools) was much longer. Historic sites may even yield heirloom  items&mdash;treasured possessions that were handed down from one generation to the  next&mdash;and such objects were often manufactured many decades before they were got  broken and discarded or lost. </p></td>
