	<td width="448" class="text"><p>Important features of the swept yard were summarized by archeologists  Barbara Heath and Amber Bennett in their 2000 article, &quot;The Little Spots  Allow&rsquo;d Them: The Archeological Study of African American Yards.&rdquo; They note  that African, Caribbean, and African-American  yards today serve as locations for spiritual and artistic expression. Swept  yards are common features of West and Central African domestic compounds, and the  practice of sweeping carries spiritual as well as social dimensions. Among  the Bakongo of Central Africa, &ldquo;sweeping is an ordinary ritual gesture for  ridding a place of undesirable spirits&rdquo; in a landscape populated by day with  the ghosts of witches and others who have not been accepted into the villages  of the dead, and by night with the ancestors.&nbsp;  The authors note that this African practice of yard sweeping has  continued into the 20th century among African Americans from rural Maryland to the hills of Jamaica. Sweeping is explained as a  way to keep the yard free from insects and provide a comfortable area for  social activities, but may preserve spiritual meaning as well. </p></td>

    <td class="text"><p>In Texas,  there is historical and archeological evidence for the practice of yard  sweeping in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the Richland  Chambers Reservoir archeological project in northeast Texas, oral history researchers noted that  almost all of the informants who were interviewed keep their yards swept.  Furthermore, archeological evidence of yard sweeping was clearly visible in at  least four farmstead sites and present but less evident in five others. The  researchers concluded that the practice &ldquo;did not seem to be strongly associated  with any specific socioeconomic group or temporal period.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>Virginia archeologist Garrett Fesler notes  that &ldquo;few African Diaspora archaeological projects have attempted to study  yards.&rdquo; This is unfortunate, she believes, because the yard is such a critical area for  understanding African American sites : </p>
    <p><em>We have come to learn that Anglo Americans and Europeans centered their  livelihood inside their homes, whereas Africans and African Americans orbited  outside their houses, sometimes by hundreds of feet, and spent comparatively  little time indoors. For archaeologists to concentrate their excavations inside  dwelling foundations at a site occupied by people of African descent is another  case of letting the core take precedence over the periphery</em>.</p></td>
