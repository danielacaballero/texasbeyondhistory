    <td class="text"><p>These two figures depict different locations along Rock Wall F1, illustrating the large size of the rocks and the substantial nature of this rock wall. The wall sections are not particularly tall, being less than 3 ft in most places, but they are 4 to 4.5 ft wide and would have made a very effective livestock fence. The individual stones are large slabs of limestone that undoubtedly came from the wooded pasture area to the north. The large stones were probably dragged into place using a skid pulled by a mule or horse. Note that the photo scale in the photograph on the right is a 1-meter stick marked in 10 cm increments.</p>
<p>Another interesting phenomenon is visible in both profiles. Sediments are trapped and preserved on the south side of the wall sections, but are deflated and eroded on the north side as a result of two factors. The northern area was designed as a livestock fence and corral, and traffic by mules, horses, and cows certainly contributed to the erosion. The northern area also slopes more substantially than the area to the south, increasing the likelihood that the sediments would wash away.</p> </td>
