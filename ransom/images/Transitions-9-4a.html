      <p>Paul Mullins, professor and chair of the Anthropology  Department at Indiana University-Purdue, has published a number of articles and books  focused on   identifying evidence of consumer behavior from archeological material culture and determining how culture, race, and racism  are intertwined with buying practices. In his research,  Mullins has shown that transposing modern concepts of wealth onto past peoples  is misleading. Archeologists, he cautions, should not measure wealth in  monetary terms alone without considering the underlying &ldquo;material symbolism.&rdquo;  Consumption has always been an expression of &ldquo;social and personal desires.&rdquo;   Many  objects carried  symbolic meaning for the people who owned them and to  others within and outside their community. </p>
      <p> African Americans, Mullins notes, cannot be  characterized by a single, simplistic consumer behavior pattern. Consumer  practices varied widely across time and space, as did the underlying political  motives for some forms of consumption. In some cases, consumerism may have been  a conscious form of resistance to the dominance of white society&mdash;a subtle form  of political activism. Under other circumstances, consumer choices may have  been expressions of people&rsquo;s personal identities rather than political  statements.</p>
      <p>Historical research and archeological studies have  demonstrated one important fact about the African Americans in the post-emancipation  period. Rather than being idle bystanders in this period of unprecedented  growth, the large freedmen population from the South spread across the country  and became a significant factor within the nation&rsquo;s consumer economy as they  sought to obtain their slice of the American dream. </p>
