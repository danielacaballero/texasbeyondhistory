      <h3>Populations and &ldquo;Packing Thresholds&rdquo;</h3>
      <p>The lower Bosque River basin covers 2,351&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, or ca. 235,130 hectares, and   includes the South and Middle Bosque Rivers, Hog Creek, and the lower North   Bosque River from its merger with the South Bosque to ca. 65&nbsp;km upstream to the   vicinity of Meridian, Texas. The lower Bosque River basin contains vital   resources that were exploited by hunters and gatherers, a few of which were   heavily or commonly used at all three sites and many other sites throughout the   area. These include white-tailed deer, geophytes (roots, bulbs, and tubers),   freshwater mussels, firewood, and lithic raw materials.</p>
      <p>Access to these resources was assured through mobility. In his 2001analysis   of modern-day hunters and gatherers, archeological theorist Lewis Binford found   that residential mobility was the key mechanism that assured groups access to   resources. Hunters and gatherers, particularly those that exploit large mammals,   tend to use relatively narrow environmental niches and face constricted mobility   as regional populations grow. Based on ethnographically known hunters and   gatherers largely dependent on large terrestrial game such as deer, he found   that &ldquo;packing&rdquo; of the landscape begins at about 1.6 persons per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. At this   point the regional population of large mammals declines, and hunting as a major   subsistence strategy decreases. Hunting of large mammals will continue to   decrease as population densities increase to a &ldquo;packing threshold&rdquo; of 9.1   persons per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. At this point mobility becomes severely constrained, and   groups are forced to broaden their diet through new subsistence strategies.   Depending on environmental parameters, this may include intensified use of   aquatic resources such as fish and shellfish, intensified use of plants, or the   adoption of horticulture.</p>
      <p>Based on evidence recovered from the  Britton, McMillan, and   Higginbotham sites, subsistence patterns, and hence mobility, appear unchanged   over the last few millennia in the lower Bosque basin. Because there is no   indication of intensified use of aquatic or plant resources or the use of   horticulture, we assume that the &ldquo;packing threshold&rdquo; of 9.1 persons per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>   was never exceeded during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. A   broad-spectrum foraging pattern focused on deer, geophytes, mussels, and small   mammals and reptiles suggests that the initial &ldquo;packing&rdquo; point of 1.6 persons   per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was exceeded and that mobility was not unrestrained. In a broad   sense, this subsistence pattern predates the time frame represented by these    sites and represents an unchanging, successful way of life that had its   genesis nearly 9,000 years ago in the region. In his 1995 overview of central   Texas archeology, archeologist Michael Collins states that &ldquo;there are   distinctive changes to be seen within the Archaic archeological record, but it   is not clear how significant these really were at the times they occurred.&rdquo; We   assume that sometime around 9,000 years ago, Binford&rsquo;s initial packing threshold   (1.6 person per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was reached. At this point exploitation of large   mammals, primarily deer, started to decline, resulting in subsistence and   dietary adjustments such as increasing the diet breadth. Overall, the   subsistence pattern remained relatively stable over the time frame represented   by the  Britton, McMillan, and Higginbotham sites, but mobility appears   to have become more constricted. The formation of burned rock middens at   McMillan, Higginbotham, and other sites of the same time period in the region is   evidence of this, because the accumulation of burned rock hearth and oven debris   represents more frequent reuse of various locales. </p>
      <p>So how did the subsistence pattern remain relatively unchanged for several   millennia, with mobility becoming more constrained? The answer must be that,   although human population densities increased, the resource base was rich enough and/or acquisition  and use was efficient enough to support hunting and gathering groups in increasingly smaller spaces. This is   not to say that hunters and gatherers did not experience periodic food   shortages. On average, though, there were plenty of resources that, when used efficiently, could  support a   foraging way of life in the lower Bosque basin. This suggests that, throughout   the Archaic and subsequent Late Prehistoric periods, population densities far   exceeded the initial packing point of 1.6 persons per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> but did not ever   exceed the packing threshold of 9.1 persons per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p>Given this, <strong>we estimate that up to 9.1 persons per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> inhabited the   lower Bosque River basin&mdash;an estimate that equates to 214 people. </strong>We assume that   groups and group membership were dynamic and fluid and that the 214 individuals   living in the lower Bosque basin may have at times comprised either many small   groups or a few larger groups. Based on the division of labor and labor   schedules of ethnographically known hunters and gatherers, Binford suggests that   a minimal group size of 18 to 20 people could be maintained throughout most of   the year. Based on a producer/dependent member ratio of 1.75, this minimal group   would consist of 10 to 11 food producers (both male and female) and 7 to 10   dependents (e.g., children). Groups as small as 9 people could be maintained,   but only for relatively short periods of time. </p>
