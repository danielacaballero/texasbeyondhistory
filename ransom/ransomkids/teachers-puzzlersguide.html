    <td height="1565"><p>In the POPULATION Puzzlers activity, students use U.S. Census data to answer relevant questions about Texas and United States racial groups during the 1850-1890 time period. Viewing this data gives students a better understanding of Ransom Williams&rsquo; place in the larger state and national populations. The associated questions in the activity are math-based and include &lsquo;hints&rsquo; to help students solve the problems. Student scores are recorded on the activity page. This activity was designed for 7th and 8th grades but can easily be adapted for other grade levels. </p>
      <p>The questions below may be used to test your students&rsquo; mastery of the material after completing the activity.</p>
      <p>Questions for students:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which Texas and U.S. populations show the greatest difference between 1860 and 1870? How would you explain this difference?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>In 1865, all 182,566 slaves in Texas became free. What social and economic problems might they have had adjusting to freedom? </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you think all slaves becoming free affected Texas&rsquo; economy after the 1860s? Explain.</li>
      </ul>
