        &nbsp;<em>Discover  a 19th-Century African American Farmstead</em></p>
<p>Ransom and Sarah Williams were former slaves who raised 9  children on their farm southwest of Austin,   Texas. We know about their lives  from archeological and historical research conducted at the site in 2008-2010.  The five activities in this module provide an opportunity for students to learn  what life was like for an African-American family after Emancipation and in the early  years of the 20th century. These should be particularly valuable and  interesting activities for <strong>Black History  Month</strong>.</p>
      <p>A handout of questions to test your students&rsquo; knowledge of  these activities is included below and may be downloaded as a pdf file. A standards-based,  multi-day <strong>lesson</strong> for 4th-7th  grades also is correlated to this activity set (see www.texasbeyondhistory.net/ransom/teach.html). Here's what's covered in the activities:</p>
      <p><u>Activity 1:</u> <strong><em>What&rsquo;s the Story</em></strong> is a colorful and  fun interactive led by Dr. Dirt, the Armadillo Archeologist.&nbsp; He explains why the farmstead site and the  Williams family are significant and how archeologists and historians wove  together evidence about their lives.</p>
      <p><u>Activity 2:</u> In<strong><em> Explore the Farm</em></strong>, students examine  a special interactive painting of the Williams Family in 1878. In the process,  they will learn about individual family members and the artifacts that helped  archeologists reconstruct these engaging scenes of farm and family life, from  working in the fields to playing with toys.</p>
      <p><u>Activity 3:</u> <strong><em>Peek Inside the Cabin</em></strong> works off a scene  of Sarah Williams and her daughter Mattie engaged in a typical activity after  supper. Students are challenged to find &ldquo;hidden clues&rdquo; to several fascinating  artifacts found inside the cabin.</p>
      <p><u>Activity 4</u>: In <strong><em>Check out the Corral</em></strong>, students see  the various types of evidence that archeologists used to reconstruct the corral  area on the farm and how they learned&nbsp;  that Ransom Williams raised horses.</p>
      <p><u>Activity 5</u>: <strong><em>Visit on the Porch</em></strong> is an imaginary  story about the Williams family woven together from the actual evidence recovered  in farmstead investigations.&nbsp; Teachers  may read it aloud to the class or students may read independently.</p>
      <p><strong><u>Student Questions:&nbsp; </u></strong>10 questions to test your students&rsquo;  understanding of these activities: <u><a href="images/Interactive Questions 7-2.pdf" target="_blank">Download as pdf</a></u></p>
      <p><strong><u>Teachers' Answers:</u></strong> Suggested answers to questions.&nbsp; Some  will be subjective. <u><a href="images/Interactive Answers 7-2.pdf" target="_blank">Download as pdf.</a></u></p>
<p><strong>Credits&nbsp; </strong><em>Discover a 19th-Century  Farm</em> was written by 4th-grade teacher  Laine Leibick and TBH Editor Susan Dial, and developed as an interactive for the web by Assistant Editor Heather Smith. Leibick has taught in Austin I.S.D. since 1976, serving as a classroom  teacher in third and fourth grade and a science specialist for grades K - 5.  She has worked with gifted students in language arts, science and social  studies, conducted teacher in-services, and written curriculum used in a number  of A.I.S.D. G/T programs. She has been recognized with the <strong>HEB Lifetime Achievement Award</strong> for excellence in teaching at a Texas elementary school, as well as a 2014 <strong>Outstanding Teacher of the Humanities Award </strong>by Humanities Texas. <strong><u></u></strong></p>
