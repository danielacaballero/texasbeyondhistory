    <td><p>The interactive Who, What, Where, and When? Timeline displays local, state and national events by decade, from the 1850s through the 1880s. Historical information, illustrative images, vocabulary definitions, and relevant primary source documents help students paint a picture of Ransom Williams&rsquo; life during the turbulent period before, during, and after the Civil War. The activity is designed for 7th and 8th grade students, but can be easily adapted to other grade levels.</p>
      <p>After students explore the timeline, ask the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What do you see as the main difference between life for African Americans in Ransom Williams&rsquo; time and life for them today?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>If you could meet Ransom Williams today and ask him three questions about his life and times, what would you ask? What three questions would you ask his wife, Sarah?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The Williams family had no radio, television, telephones, or computers and little access to written materials. How do you think they might have learned about events in their community? In Texas? In the United States?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li>How are primary sources different from other sources? How are they valuable in studying history?</li>
