The team found fragments of the Williams' dishes, utensils, crocks, and pots used for storing food, cooking, and serving meals. They even uncovered the remains of some of the meals at the Williams farmstead, including the bones of pigs, cows, chickens, rabbits, and birds.   Some of the bones had distinctive cutting, chopping, and sawing marks made by knives or other metal tools during butchering or before cooking.  </span></p>
	<span class="whatsstyle">Even though they raised animals for food, Ransom Williams and his sons also added to their family’s food supply by hunting.  They probably supplied the family dinner table with rabbit, squirrel, possum, and turkey from the woods on their property, as well as doves and quail. Based on plant remains found at the site, the Williams  girls may have gathered wild plants, such as onions, walnuts, and dewberries, and also served corn, sweet potatoes, and peaches from the garden at mealtimes.</span></td>

Before canning methods were developed in the late 1700 and early 1800’s, there were just a few ways, such as drying, salting and smoking, that food could be safely preserved for very long.   By the time the Williams family was living on their Texas homestead, many canned foods were available.  Farming families sometimes used these foods to get through the winter months when their supplies ran low. </p>
	
	<p class="whatsstyle">A variety of heavy stoneware crocks and jugs were found at the Williams farmstead.  These usually had a lid and were used for storing food to keep it fresh.
