In addition to transporting the family back and forth to town,  wagons were used to haul heavy tools and supplies from one part of the farm to another.    Horse-labor may also have been a source of outside income if Williams used his wagons to haul freight for others. </span></p>

The brake arm was held in position by a series of notches.  Interestingly, the brake could not completely stop a wagon without the horses’ cooperation.  Even with the brake on, a runaway team of horses could still drag the wagon if they did not want to stop!</p>	</td>

Mules were probably employed for the heavier work around the farm such as hauling and plowing, since horses were considered far more valuable and are more prone to injury than mules.  The metal “shoe” helps protect the hooves of horses and mules which are made of material similar to human fingernails but much thicker.  The nails are driven through small holes in the shoe and into the hoof. Archeologists found a total of 13 horsehoes and 2 muleshoes. Muleshoes are typically larger than horseshoes and are shaped differently. </p>
	  
<p class="whatsstyle">A variety of horse gear—or tack—was found at the farm, including several kinds of bridle bits.  The bit is the piece that goes into the horse’s mouth.  Different kinds of bits may be used for different jobs, such as individual riding and pulling wagons or carriages.  Bits also vary according to the size of the horse and how quickly the horse responds to the rider’s or driver’s directions. <img src="kids-right-arrow-sm.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="15" align="absmiddle"></p>    </td>

The letters “RA” were registered to Ransom Williams in April of 1872 as his horse brand according to the Travis County Register of Marks and Brands from that year.  </p>
	
	<p class="whatsstyle">The horses and mules may have pulled wagons filled with large wooden barrels, an especially important job at the Williams farm. Archeologists found more than 40 pieces of metal barrel  hoops at the  site.  These metal strips held together the wooden boards, or staves, that make up a barrel.  <img src="kids-right-arrow-sm.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="15" align="absmiddle"></p>
	<p class="whatsstyle">Some of the hoops show the machine-cut ends and rivets that fastened the band into a large circle.  Others are crudely cut and repaired by hand indicating that Ransom made his own repairs to continue using a broken hoop.  Since they did not have running water in the cabin, or even a water well, the Williams may have used barrels to haul water from nearby Bear Creek for daily use. Water was a critical resource for the family and  the livestock on the farm. </p></td>
