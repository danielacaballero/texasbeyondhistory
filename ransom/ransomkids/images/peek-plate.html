    <td class="text"><p>The lovely blue and white dinner plate that Sarah Williams  is drying was part of a matching set of china. Archeologists found pieces of  several broken plates, cups, and saucers that had the same floral pattern  printed on them. Several fragments had marks printed on the bottom that tell us  which company made the dishes. The distinctive maker&rsquo;s mark has a banner with  the name &quot;KENWOOD&quot; inside it, over a globe and banner enclosing the  name &ldquo;ALFRED MEAKIN.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;ENGLAND&rdquo;  appears under the globe. </p>
      <p>This mark dates the manufacture of these wares between 1891  and 1897, and Kenwood is the name of the floral pattern. Similar wares made by  the Alfred Meakin company of Tunstall,   England, were  sold in mail-order catalogs (like the 1895 Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. catalog).  These English-made decorated wares were moderately expensive. We can imagine  that Sarah and her daughters spent a fair amount of time looking through the  china sets illustrated in the catalog before deciding which one to buy. According to the catalog page shown above, Sarah chose the new color, &quot;flown pearl&quot; which was a dark blue. </p></td>
