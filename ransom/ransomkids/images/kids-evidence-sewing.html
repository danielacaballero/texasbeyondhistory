Archeologists found all of these items at the  Williams farmstead. In fact, there were so many artifacts  related to sewing and clothing that we think Sarah, and possibly her daughters  as well, may have been sewing for neighbors in addition to taking care of the  needs of their own family. </span></p>
 
    <span class="whatsstyle">The archeologists found a pair of rusty  scissors handles (missing their blades). They were just the right size  for cutting fabric. Sarah likely used these to cut out patterns  for new shirts and dresses and to cut the squares for her quilts. </span>
    <p class="whatsstyle">The thimble shown below probably  protected Sarah's and the girls' thumbs from being jabbed by their needles  while sewing. Did you know thimbles date back almost 1800 years to  ancient China?&nbsp;&nbsp;  In medieval Europe, thimbles were made from  thick leather, bone, and ivory as well as brass.&nbsp; In  the 1700&rsquo;s, silver thimbles were a popular gift for ladies in America.&nbsp;  While thimbles may be very plain or covered with small geometric designs, they  can also be very elaborate with engraved pictures and initials. Sarah&rsquo;s thimble  is very rusty, having been buried in the ground for so many years, but it  appears to be simple in design.</p>	</td>

	  <p class="whatsstyle">Both  straight pins and safety pins were found at the farm. Straight pins were used  to pin clothes while sewing. Safety pins were used for fastening diapers and other  clothing.&nbsp; The modern safety pin was patented by an  American mechanic named Walter Hunt in 1849.&nbsp; Hunt used an 8-inch piece of  brass wire and designed a coil in the center so the pin would &ldquo;spring&rdquo; open.  There is a clasp at one end to shield the wearer from the sharp point. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="whatsstyle">Velcro and zippers, so popular in clothing today, are inventions of the 20th  century and make our lives easier. In the 1800&rsquo;s, clothing was fastened with  ties or laces, small metal hooks, and most frequently, with buttons. Sewing  these tiny items onto clothing was time consuming for the seamstress.</p>    </td>

They came in a wide variety of styles, sizes and materials. Some  were cut from bone or shell. Others were made of metal, glass or hard rubber.  Some are small, about 3/8 inch in diameter, and rather plain in design; these were  commonly used on men&rsquo;s shirts. A few of the buttons are of bright colors or  have engraved designs, such as sunbursts, flowers, and swirls. These fancier buttons  probably added a stylish touch to clothing worn to church or for special  occasions. </p>

The buckle at top left is stamped with the  patent date of 1890, and matches the patent drawing showing the mechanism of  the buckle.

	  <p class="whatsstyle">With as many 9 to 11 people living at the Williams farm at any given time, sewing was a very important activity! Lost buttons and torn  clothing required repairs, and Sarah and the girls probably made some clothes from  new or recycled fabric, especially for the young children. They may have also  made and repaired bed sheets, pillow cases, quilts, and window curtains.</p></td>
