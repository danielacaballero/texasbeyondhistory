Archeologists found many types of tools used for gardening and farming in the fields.  While some work had to be done by hand, other work was done with machinery, such as a plow pulled by horses and mules. </span></p>
 
    <p class="whatsstyle">Specific tools used for farming and gardening include a set of pruning shears, the blades of two garden hoes, and a worn out pick-mattock. <img src="kids-right-arrow-sm.jpg" alt="" width="59" height="11" align="absmiddle"></p>
    <p class="whatsstyle">These items likely saw a variety of uses on the farm, from digging up rocks and tree roots, to preparing the garden bed and tending vegetables. We also might guess that Sarah might have wanted some roses planted near the house.
  </p>
    </p>
    <p class="whatsstyle">The pick mattock is a very handy tool that combines the pointed head of a pick, used for digging up hard soil and rock, and an adze, which can be used for cutting through roots.   Ransom Williams and his sons probably used the pick mattock to clear the higher ground on their property for farming.  </p>	</td>

In order to attach the farm machinery to the horse or mule, a clevis was used; in this case a clevis pin wrench. This multifunctional tool was used to tighten various nuts and bolts on the machinery.  Other tool parts found at the farm were from a scale used to weigh crops, such as cotton. </p>

  <p class="whatsstyle">The Williams men probably cut a number of trees on the farm, using some of the wood to build their cabin.  They also needed a steady supply of fire wood for cooking and heating the cabin. For these tasks they needed a strong axe. </p>
  <p class="whatsstyle"><img src="kids-left-arrow-sm.jpg" alt="" width="45" height="14">Archeologists found a steel axe head at the farm, but its butt end was split open and battered from heavy use. Its primary function was as an axe, but it also had been used as a wedge for splitting wood. </p>
  <p class="whatsstyle">The wedge-like tool also would have been useful for prying out rocks to be used in fences. There were rock fences all over the Williams farm! As shown in the photo below, on the left, archeologists surveyed and took measurements and notes on all the fences. </p></td>

To sharpen a tool, the blade was placed against the stone wheel as it turned.
