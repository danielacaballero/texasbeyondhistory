At the Williams' farm, archeologists found a strange, rectangular  piece of cast iron  studded with dangerous looking  metal teeth.   It was not an instrument of torture, but a tool for husking and shelling ears of corn!  </span></p>

By researching online, they found a drawing from the patent application filed in December of 1870 showing the parts of the device and how it was used.

An ear of  dry corn was placed between the two metal  pieces and pulled through the pointed device with a twisting motion.  Shelling corn was still a tedious task, but at least the sheller made the work faster. This was important for farm families, because corn was a staple crop, with many uses. Archeologists at the Williams farm found several tiny fragments of burned corn, which might have been remnants of a meal. (Organic materials, such as food and plant parts, are more likely to be preserved in the ground if  they were  burned.)  </p>

  <p class="whatsstyle">Corn, sometimes called maize, has been a part of the diet of the inhabitants of Texas since prehistoric times.  The corn raised by 19th-century farmers didn't look like the bright yellow sweet corn we buy today.  Some kinds weren't even yellow! </p>
  <p class="whatsstyle">Corn was used for animal feed and eaten by humans.  It was easier to grow and less expensive than wheat flour.  Settlers roasted ears of corn or dried and shelled it, then ground the kernels into coarse flour to make cornbread, hoecake, pudding, and fritters.  Dried corn was popped over the fire. Corn kernels were soaked in lye water to make hominy and ground for grits.    </p>
	
	<p class="whatsstyle">Corn was useful in many other ways as well.  The dried cobs could be used for pipes, tool handles, toys, bottle stoppers, fishing floats and other practical items.  Corn cobs were even used as fuel for fires and for smoking meat.  </p> </td>
