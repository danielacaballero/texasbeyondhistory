    <td><p><strong>Subject: </strong>Texas, American, or World History </p>
      <p><strong>Grade Level: </strong>TEKS are provided for 7thgrade  but can easily be adapted for grades 8, 10, or 11.</p>
      <p><strong>Rationale: </strong><br>
        Material objects found at historical sites can be  both intriguing and informative, especially when examined carefully in the  classroom with students. A  thorough discussion of any given artifact can be based on Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy, a classifying  device used to illustrate the&nbsp; hierarchy  of thinking levels, from simple and concrete to complex and abstract. Analyzing  artifacts from the Ransom Williams farmstead using Bloom's Taxonomy allows  students on all levels to exercise the complete range of critical thinking  skills while appreciating the cultural significance of historical objects. </p>
      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
        In this  lesson, students will analyze several of the more than 25,000 artifacts  discovered by archeologists on the historical Ransom Williams farmstead in  central Texas. These artifacts help document the story of an African American  family&rsquo;s transition from slavery to freedom and give a cultural snapshot of  life on their farm between 1874 and 1920.<strong> </strong></p>

       <li> 23B - Use a decision-making process to  identify a situation that requires a decision, gather information, identify  options, predict consequences, and take action to implement a decision.</li>
      <p><strong>Activity: </strong> </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Step 1 - Display the word <strong>artifact </strong>and       ask student volunteers to offer definitions of it. Lead students to the       following definition: &lsquo;<em>anything made or altered by man</em><strong>.&rsquo; </strong>Ask students to volunteer examples of artifacts.</li>
        <li>Step 2 - Display the image of the rusty key       and ask students if it would be considered an artifact. Explain that many       questions can be asked about artifacts, some simple and some very complex.       Explain that students will be working in small groups to answer questions       about artifacts from the Ransom Williams farmstead, discovered by       archeologists in central Texas.</li>
        <li>Step 3 - Display the Ransom Williams       website (URL here) and briefly describe the William&rsquo;s farmstead history.</li>
        <li>Step 4 - Explain that students       will use Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy to help analyze artifacts from the Williams       farmstead.       Share with students that in 1956, Dr. Benjamin Bloom devised a way to measure the       steps by which we learn. The steps begin with simple learning (knowledge)       and move up to complex learning (evaluation). To illustrate the different       levels of thinking, ask for two student volunteers. Ask one student what       his name is (simple knowledge). Ask the other student whether he would       rather ride the school bus home or ride home with his best friend (complex       evaluation). Ask students which question was simple and which was complex       and have them explain their answers. </li>
        <li>Step 5 - Have students get into small       groups. Distribute one copy of the student handout, <em>Bottles, Pins, and       Horseshoes: Analyzing Artifacts From the Ransom Williams Farmstead</em> to       each group and display the handout for the class.</li>
        <li>Step 6 - Model the lesson: Using the rusty       key image as an example, go through the chart&rsquo;s six Thinking Levels and       corresponding Cue Words with the class. Ask students to volunteer answers       to the Artifact Questions for each       thinking level on the handout, using the rusty key as their       artifact. </li>
        <li>Step 7 - Distribute artifact images to       students, one per group. Explain that they are to analyze their artifact       using Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy, just as the class did with the rusty key artifact.       Direct students to work in their groups and write their answers on the       student handout. </li>
        <li>Step 8 - Collect completed student       handouts.</li>
        <li>Step 9 - Display the webpage: <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/protect/ransom/ransomkids/kids-peekinsidethecabin.html">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/protect/ransom/ransomkids/kids-peekinsidethecabin.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a student volunteer to search for  and click on the &nbsp; stone dart point hidden  on the fireplace hearth. Read &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about  the dart point aloud with students, pointing out &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that this artifact had two applications at different times; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first as a  weapon, later as a talisman, or good luck &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charm. Explain that most cultures have examples of &nbsp;&nbsp; such &ldquo;magic&rdquo; objects, e.g. the Irish consider  the four &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaf clover a lucky charm.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Step 10 - For closure, ask students the       following: What do the artifacts we analyzed today tell us about the life       and times of Ransom Williams? Did using Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy help you       understand more about each artifact? </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Modification  for Special Learning Needs: </strong> <br>
        Instead  of having students work independently in groups, call on individuals to fill in  answers to the Student Handout. Fill in correct answers on displayed student  handout and have students copy them onto their handouts.</p>
      <p><strong>Extension Activities:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain  that artifacts can have both personal and cultural significance. Have students  bring personal artifacts from home and share them with the class, explaining  what personal and cultural significance each artifact has.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Display  the word <strong>metacognition</strong>. Explain that it means thinking about one&rsquo;s own  thought processes, an activity we engage in every day. Activities such as  analyzing an artifact or planning how to study for a test are examples of  metacognition. Ask students to name more examples. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Assessment: </strong> <br>
        Correct  completion of Student Handouts. </p>
