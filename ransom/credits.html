    <td width="480" height="2694" valign="top"><p>The Ransom and Sarah Williams  Farmstead exhibit was written by <strong>Doug  Boyd</strong> and <strong>Aaron Norment</strong> (Prewitt  and Associates, Inc.), <strong>Maria Franklin</strong> (Department of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin), <strong>Terri Myers</strong> (Preservation Central,  Inc., Austin), and <strong>Nedra Lee</strong> (PAI  and Department of Anthropology, UT-Austin). </p>
      <p>TBH Editor <strong>Susan Dial</strong> and Assistant Editor <strong>Heather Smith</strong> designed and developed the exhibit for the web, with assistance of Liberal Arts Instructional Technology Services (LAITS) at UT-Austin. TBH Education Advisors <strong>Carol Schlenk</strong> and <strong>Laine Liebick</strong> created the teachers' curricula and student activities. Special thanks to <strong>Trudy Williams </strong>who contributed countless hours proofreading and testing the exhibit.</p>
      <p>The regional and  site maps were created by PAI graphics supervisor <strong>Sandy Hannum</strong>, and <strong>Brian  Wootan</strong> created the compilation artifact figures using photographs taken by <strong>Jennifer McWilliams</strong>. The three  paintings that depict the historic lifeways of the Williams family on their  farm are by Austin  artist and retired archeologist <strong> Frank  Weir</strong>.</p>
      <p> The  audio clips used in this exhibit are from the Williams Farmstead Oral History  Collection, now housed at the <a href="http://www.cah.utexas.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Dolph Briscoe Center for American History</a> at the University of Texas  at Austin. The  video clips are from two different sources. Some are footage taken by  KLRU-television in Austin for their <em>Juneteenth Jamboree 2010</em> and used  courtesy of producer <strong>Michael Emery</strong>, while others are footage taken by LAITS and used courtesy of <strong>Daniel Garza</strong>. The Briscoe Center also provided digital images of period African-American newspapers for use in the Newspapers section of this exhibit.      </p>
      <p>The project was sponsored by  the <strong>Texas Department of Transportation</strong>. Additional funding for the exhibit was  provided by the <strong>Travis County Historical Commission</strong>, <strong>Travis County</strong>, the <strong>Texas Archeological Society</strong>, the <strong>Council of Texas  Archeologists</strong>,  the T<strong>ravis County Archeological Society</strong>, and the<strong> Friends of </strong>  <strong>the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory</strong>. <p>The many groups and individuals that  contributed to the project and this exhibit are recognized below.</p>
  <h3>Prewitt  and Associates, Inc.</h3>
  <p> As  one of the firms that contracts with TxDOT to provide cultural resources  services around the state, PAI took the lead role in the historic archeological  investigations at the Williams Farmstead from 2007 through 2013. Doug Boyd  served as the project manager and principal investigator, and the project  archeologists were Aaron Norment and Jennifer McWilliams. </p>
  <p>Boyd was raised in the small town of Tulia in the Texas Panhandle.                 He attended West Texas State University and later earned his Masters degree at Texas A&amp;M. Since                 1987 he has been a consulting archeologist for the Austin-based                 firm Prewitt and Associates, Inc., where he is now Vice President.                 </p>
  <p>Norment is a staff archeologist at Prewitt and Associates, and   much of his work focuses on historic archeology. Since the beginning of   the Ransom and Sarah Williams Farmstead project, he was   involved in project planning and execution, from field work to   laboratory analysis and report writing.  Norment received his B.A. in   Anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin and his M.A. in   Anthropology from Texas Tech University.</p>
  <h3>Department  of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin</h3>
  <p>Dr.  Maria Franklin served as an archeological consultant and directed the oral  history component of the Williams Farmstead Archeological Project. Franklin is an associate professor in the Department of  Anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin,  with a joint appointment in the African and African Diaspora Studies  Department. She is also affiliated with UT&rsquo;s John L. Warfield Center  for African and African American Studies. Franklin  joined the Williams Farmstead Archeological Project in 2008, and her  involvement is the primary reason the descendant community outreach was such an  outstanding success.</p>
      <p>Nedra Lee was a PAI employee on the  field crew for the 2009 data recovery, and she assisted in the subsequent  artifact analysis and did the archival research examining African American  newspapers published in Austin  in the late nineteenth century. In addition, Lee is a graduate student in UT&rsquo;s  Anthropology Department, and her dissertation research (directed by Dr.  Franklin and completed as of 2014) involves looking at the Williams Farmstead  material culture to examine race, space, and identity in the rural Bear Creek  community where the farm was located.</p>
      <h3>Preservation  Central, Inc.</h3>
      <p> Terri  Myers operates Preservation Central, Inc. in Austin, providing a wide range of services,  such as archival research, National Register nominations, preservation  planning, and historic resources surveys. She served as the project historian  and conducted archival research intermittently for Prewitt and Associates from  2005 through 2013. Following even the most elusive historical leads, she made  many wonderful discoveries that changed the direction and tone of the research.  Because of Myers&rsquo; meticulous research, the story of the Williams family is rich  and comprehensive.</p>
      <h3>Texas  Department of Transportation</h3>
 <p> The  Williams Farmstead Archeological Project was funded by the Texas Department of  Transportation, and overseen by the Archeological Studies Program of the  Environmental Affairs Division in Austin.  Dr. Scott Pletka is the program director, and Jon Budd is the staff  archeologist who served as project manager for all the phases of work at the  Williams Farmstead. They both took an active role in managing what turned out  to be a long and complex archeological project.</p>
      
      <h3>Manchaca-Onion  Creek Historical Association</h3>
 <p> Once  they found out about the Williams Farmstead project, members of the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mochaonline.org/" target="_blank">Manchaca-Onion Creek Historical Association</a> took an active interest our research, visiting both the archeological site and  the PAI laboratory. In particular, Marilyn Dunnahoo McLeod has a deep  connection to the site, and she had heard of Ransom Williams. As it turns out,  her great-grandfather Daniel Labenski was Ransom Williams&rsquo; neighbor from the  1870s to the turn-of-the century. McLeod shared all of her family genealogy and  research files with PAI, and this information proved to be quite helpful in  many ways.</p>
 <h3>Descendant Community </h3>
 <p>The oral history research, organized and directed by Dr.  Franklin, was an integral part of the Williams Farmstead Archeological Project.  While Dr. Franklin and PAI certainly played a big role in this effort, the real  contribution to the project is the 46 hours of audiotaped stories generously  donated by the 27 people who agreed to be interviewed. All of these people had  a vested interest in the project, and they believed that their stories&mdash;and the  history we were seeking to document&mdash;were important. </p>
 <p>Since the publication of  the oral history narratives in 2012, no one can deny that these interviews  contain valuable historical perspectives and details not found in any other  sources. All but two of the interviewees are African Americans who are members  of the descendant community, and these people share a common heritage and bond  with the Williams family of the late nineteenth century. All of these people deserve a big  &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; for their contributions! On a sad note, three of these people  passed away before the oral history report was completed in March 2012, so they  did not get to see the fruits of their labor.</p>
