    <td width="480" height="11574" valign="top"><p>The story of how  Ransom and Sarah Williams, through hard work and perseverance, made their way up from slavery,  through the Reconstruction period, into  the Jim Crow era and  to the time they left  the farm early in the twentieth century, is a post-emancipation success story of a kind not found in other Texas historical narratives. This was a period of tremendous  changes for African Americans as they became citizens, landowners, businessmen,  paid laborers, craftsmen, and consumers.</p>
      <p> When viewed in light of  historical documents and records, the archeological materials recovered  from the farmstead provide tangible evidence of these transitions and the  success of this freedman family in central Texas. Amid the thousands of artifacts and  farmstead remains, we also find poignant expressions of the family&rsquo;s traditions  and values&#8212;and even echoes of their distant African ancestry. </p>
      <p>Ransom Williams purchased his 45-acre farm in 1871, and he  likely lived alone for a few years before marrying Sarah Houston, sometime  around 1875. In these early years, Ransom began clearing some of his land for  cultivation, building rock fences for his livestock, and working on his log  cabin. He probably completed the construction of the house before he and Sarah  were married, and their first son, Will, was born in 1876. While Sarah took care of the child and did the cooking, mending, gardening and other chores, Ransom  worked the pastures and agricultural fields, tending to his livestock and  crops. The family grew over the next two decades, and Ransom and Sarah worked  hard at raising nine children on the family farm.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Williams farm was situated in a thin-soiled, rocky  upland&mdash;the type of land not particularly conducive to farming. But hard work  and careful attention to the land and the crops could ensure a successful yield  each year as long as rainfall was adequate. As former slaves, Ransom and Sarah  were not strangers to hard work. Most likely, Ransom had been a slave on the  Bunton plantation in northern Hays   County, and he probably  knew first hand the labor involved in planting and picking cotton, how to care  for livestock, including horses, and how to do  other farming tasks under  less than ideal farming conditions. Historic records and the artifacts found on  the farmstead prove that hard work did indeed pay off for the Williams family.  Their success can be traced in tax records and in the consumer goods they  purchased during the three decades they spent on the farm. On a larger scale,  these reflect the family&rsquo;s transitions from self-sufficient farmers to  participants in the rapidly changing American economy.</p>
      <h3><strong><a name="consumers"></a>The Williams Family  as American Consumers</strong></h3>
      <p>In the early 1870s, having just purchased the farm and  gotten married, Ransom and Sarah Williams would not have had much extra cash.  During this time, the farm operation was probably geared toward home production  and self-sufficiency. The family produced and made most of what they needed on  the farm, but they had little extra to sell and probably purchased outside  goods from other farmers or commercial businesses only when absolutely  necessary. As time passed and they became more successful, the Williamses  continued to purchase the necessities of farm life, but they also spent more of  their extra income on nonessential items and even some things that would be  considered luxuries. As the Williams family grew, however, there were more  mouths to feed and children to clothe. There is no doubt that the Williamses  had to have had a steady source of income to simultaneously raise their  children, increase their farm productivity, and acquire the material wealth  that is evident in the archeological record. </p>
      <p>During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, America was  experiencing an economic boom resulting from the mass-production of goods, the  rapid spread of rail transportation, and widespread consumer-oriented product  advertising. All types of goods could be manufactured more quickly and  efficiently, shipped more easily, and sold more cheaply than ever  before.&nbsp;Prices dropped and availability increased. The railroad had come  to Austin in  1871, just as Williams was buying his farm, and it turned the capital city into  a regional market hub. They might have been able to shop in some general stores  in small communities that were closer to their farm (such as Manchaca Springs),  but the Williamses most likely made occasional journeys to Austin by horse or  wagon. The Williams farmstead was about a dozen miles from Austin as a crow flies, and more than 15  miles by wagon roads. A round trip by horse would have taken most of a day,  while a round trip by wagon would probably have taken the better part of two  days and required an overnight stay. </p>
      <p>In 1880, the International &amp; Great Northern Railroad was  completed from Austin to San Marcos, and the small communities along  the route began to blossom and thrive. The town of Manchaca Springs was  relocated about 2.5 miles east of the Williams farm. This meant that Ransom Williams  could make a quick trip into town, by horse or wagon, to get supplies. The  proximity of the railroad at Manchaca, as it came to be known, increased the  Williams&rsquo; access to goods and services, as well as the family&rsquo;s ability to get  their farm products to markets. </p>
      <h3><a name="catalogues"></a>Mail Order Catalogs  and Mass Production</h3>
      <p>Efficient manufacturing technologies and a more extensive  transportation network meant lower prices, and a vast array of durable goods  became affordable for the masses, including farmers and laborers in the rural  hinterlands.&nbsp; By the late 1880s, large  retail companies such as Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. and Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.  were selling a wide variety of products to consumers all across the country  through their mail-order catalogs. These typically were available in general  stores in small, rural towns.</p>
      <p>After the Civil War, people across America began shifting away from  home production toward consumption of commercial products, but it seems the  Williamses were still very much a part of both ways of life. In many ways, the  Williams farm was always a self-sufficient operation, and the family probably  produced a great deal of the food they consumed and the products they used in  any given year. But as the family farm became increasingly successful, some aspects  of the farming operation may have become more commercialized. Planting more  cash crops brought in more income, and this money would have been used to pay  taxes, buy essential farming tools and staple foods, and perhaps to purchase  seeds for the next year&rsquo;s crops. If there was any money left, it could be saved  or spent on nonessential or luxury items. </p>
      <p>It is interesting, albeit somewhat tricky, to try to  calculate how much income he might have netted each year and how much buying  power he might have had. Ransom Williams managed to be excluded from all the  population and agricultural censuses while he lived on the farm, and this may  have been intentional if he wanted to stay out of the limelight. This exclusion  means that we do not know exactly what crops he grew or how much money he made  from the sale of particular cash crops. However, we can make an educated guess based on the records of his neighbors and data from the annual Agricultural Bureau Report.</p>
      <p>Based on the estimated prices paid for cotton and corn  during the 1880s and 1890s in Travis and Hays counties, Ransom could have made  somewhere between $155 and $200 annually.&nbsp;Likely half to three quarters of  this amount would have been spent on consumable goods (food, medicine, tobacco,  ammunition, etc.) and durable goods (fabric, buttons, tools, and equipment).  The remaining money may have been as little as $40 or as much as $100, and this  money, along with any other income Ransom and Sarah might have derived from  doing odd jobs such as hauling, sewing, or gunsmithing, was discretionary  money.&nbsp;This extra money&mdash;small by our standards today&mdash;represented a  significant amount of buying power in the late nineteenth century. For Ransom  and Sarah Williams, it represented the ability to purchase a few luxuries for  themselves and their children, and a chance for them to participate in the  great American dream.</p>
      <p>Judging from the recovered artifacts, it appears that the  family&rsquo;s purchasing power and consumption of commercial products increased  significantly in the 1890s. Ransom and Sarah Williams clearly used some of their  discretionary money&mdash;profit made from their successful farming operation&mdash;to  purchase nonessential items, and they likely made some of their purchases through mail-order catalogs. &nbsp;Among the artifacts we matched with pictures in the catalogs are several musical instruments, a men's pocket watch, a Frontier Bull Dog revolver, a kerosene lamp with crysal glass base, ornamental items such as a ladies' brooch, jet buttons, a hair comb, and a variety of childrens' toys and school items. Despite their physical isolation, there is  little doubt that the family soon became well entrenched in the burgeoning  American consumer culture of the day.</p>
      <h3><a name="identity"></a>Making Choices and Expressing Identity </h3>
      <p>For the Williams family, this new means of making choices  and expressing identities may have been laden with symbolic as well as  political meanings. In the view of archeologist and author Paul Mullins, people  have always used material culture as a means of reinforcing their social  status, group affiliation, and individual identities.&nbsp;To freedmen who had  once been commodities themselves, the concepts of wealth, class, and social  privilege were not at all foreign. In <em>The  Archaeology of Consumer Culture</em>, Mullins posits: &nbsp;&ldquo;African Americans understood the significant  privileges vested in consumer citizenship, privileges many white consumers  simply took for granted. The collapse of Reconstruction vanquished many of  African Americans' partisan political ambitions and began a lengthy assault on  their public rights, and this may have boosted the politicization of  consumption among African Americans.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many  blacks were optimistic that free-market capitalism would eventually level the  playing field, but others &ldquo;tended to soberly acknowledge  the deep rootedness of anti-black racism and believed that it was only in a  largely insular black economy that African Americans might blaze their own path  to self-determination.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>As successful farmers and landowners, Ransom and Sarah  Williams were able to build a good life for themselves and acquire some  luxuries for the family. They did business with African American  enterprises when possible. When they spent extra money on a matching set of  china with an elegant floral design, imported from England and complete with a tea  service (cups and saucers), it was an expression of their financial success and  equality as American consumers. Owning such objects was for them, as it is for  so many people today, a source of pride and a statement of identity. At the  same time, however, Ransom and Sarah Williams probably had no illusions about  their place on the social ladder in the Jim Crow South. When they ventured into  public in the white world, they would have dressed conservatively and kept their  displays of wealth  to a minimum.</p>
      <h3><a name="socialid"></a>Archeology and Social  Identity: Who Were the Williamses?</h3>
      <p>Ransom and Sarah Williams and their children cannot be  lumped into a group represented by a single identity. Rather, like all peoples,  their identities varied according to particular social situations. At different  times, they would have been Americans, African American freedmen, Texans,  central Texas  farmers, horse breeders, business entrepreneurs, consumers, laborers, or  Christians. At many times, the family&rsquo;s identity would have been defined by a  combination of their race and economic class, with their role as African  American landowners being the significant criteria that defined their lives  within the white Bear Creek community and the nearby freedmen communities at  Antioch Colony and Rose Colony-Manchaca. Their identities  also were shaped by  the larger political structures that were controlled by white-run society,  including the governments of Travis County, the State of Texas,  and the United States. </p>
      <p>Amid these many transitions, there also is evidence the family  held on to some of the old ways, perhaps derived from Ransom&rsquo;s early years in  the plantation South where cherished African folk traditions and spiritual  beliefs were passed on from generation to generation and burnished in their  memories. In this section, we examine some of the Williams family identities as  revealed by the archeological investigations and recovered artifacts. </p>
      <h3><a name="tradition"></a>Keepers of Tradition:  The Southern Swept Yard</h3>
      <p>Although it was less intensively investigated than the house  footprint or trash midden, the immediate yard area around the Williams house  proved to be an important component of the farmstead. After comparing the  artifact recovery rates across the house complex, we discovered that the yard  area had an extremely low artifact density and yielded an abundance of small  and fragmentary items. To explain this phenomenon, we proposed that the  Williams family maintained a swept-earth yard, keeping it devoid of vegetation  and regularly sweeping it to remove debris. </p>
      <p>The swept yard, a tradition that can be traced back to Africa and the Carribean, serves not only a practical function but  carries symbolic and social meaning. Archeologists Barbara Heath and Amber Bennet note that the Bakongo of Central Africa believe that sweeping as a ritual gesture helps rid a place of undesirable spirits (see sidebar: The Southern Swept Yard). </p>
      <p> In his summary of African American  archeology in the South, Virginia archeologist Fesler summarized  the practice as follows:</p>
      <p><em>Sweeping a dirt  yard bare around the house is a familiar practice today to most rural American  Southerners, both black and white, although swept yards are especially  prevalent in rural African-American home sites in the South. In fact, Southern  whites likely adopted the practice of yard sweeping from African-Americans as  Southern culture was creolized. The functional reasons for keeping a yard swept  are numerous, including ridding the yard of insects, snakes, and other vermin,  keeping the grass down to prevent brush fires, and providing a clean, orderly  place for socializing out of doors, especially during the hot and humid summer  months.</em></p>
      <p>The swept yard tradition was still  practiced in central Texas  into the 1930s and 1940s, as demonstrated in an oral history interview. Ruth  Fears, who grew up in the Antioch Colony freedmen community 4.5 miles from the  Williams farmstead, recalled: &ldquo;We got out and swept the yard, swept the yard  clean.&rdquo; She also recalled using broom weed: &ldquo;We&rsquo;d get them and tie them around  at the bottom and sweep the yard up. That&rsquo;s what we swept the yard with.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Given the long history and  significance of the swept yard tradition among Southern African Americans, it  is not surprising that the Williams family practiced yard sweeping at their  home. The archeological evidence suggests that they did this regularly over a  long period of time. Exactly why they did this is less certain. As former  slaves, it is likely that Ransom and Sarah would have been aware of the  spiritual connotations of yard sweeping. Unfortunately, we know nothing of  their specific African roots and can only speculate on the extent to which  Ransom and Sarah believed they were sweeping away evil spirits. Perhaps this  cultural tradition was important to them because it provided a connection with  their ancestors. Or they may have simply wanted a swept yard to provide a safe  place for young children to play and protect their home from brush fires. In  any case, the original knowledge of the early practitioners has been lost, and  people who keep swept yards today are often totally unaware of the spiritual  connotations that yard sweeping once had.</p>
      
        <h3><a name="ritual"></a>Believers in Ritual: The  Dart Point in the Chimney Firebox</h3>
      <p>A small  artifact found inside the cabin provides further evidence of deeply held  traditions among the Williams family. In terms of its symbolic meaning, it is intriguing that this artifact is not even a historic item but a prehistoric one. Archeologists  uncovered a nearly complete chipped-stone dart point in the chimney. Clearly, it had   been placed in the sand and rock layer at the bottom of the firebox for  a particular purpose. Its context leaves no doubt that the dart point  represents some type of ritual offering that was made when the chimney and  house were being constructed. We believe that this dart point was a protective  charm placed in the fireplace by Ransom Williams. </p>
      <p>The dart point may have had a  relatively simple meaning, such as to bring good luck to the household, similar  to what a horseshoe hung above a doorway means. Or its symbolism may have been  deeper, perhaps representing an offering to honor the ancestors who lived on  the land before, or a charm to keep evil spirits from entering the house through  the fireplace. </p>
      <p>There are many examples of material culture used by African  Americans as charms in religious, spiritual, or ritual contexts. Documented  through oral history, archeological finds, or both, these types of offerings  include: concentrations of sewing items and shiny objects associated with  conjure bags; placement of particular objects into symbolic patterns (e.g., cosmogram);  markings on artifacts (engraved cosmogram); coins worn in a shoe; coins (often  dimes) with drilled holes worn as necklaces and ankle bracelets; exotic natural  stones (crystals and polished rocks), and Native American artifacts (especially  projectile points).</p>
      <p>In their 1997 article, <em>Conjuring in the Big House Kitchen:  An Interpretation of African American Belief Systems, Based on the Uses of  Archaeology and Folklore Sources</em>, Mark Leone and Gladys-Marie Fry note that  chimneys and hearths were important locations within African American dwellings  where ritual caches or bundles were frequently placed, citing cases in Virginia  and  Maryland. Collectively, a great deal of historical and  archeological evidence indicates that windows, doors, and chimneys were thought  to represent openings where evil spirits could enter or leave a house, and  these were the spots were conjuring charms were placed.</p>
      <p>Although we will probably never know why Ransom Williams  placed this dart point in the center of the firebox when he built his house, we  can add this example to a growing list of archeological finds where Native  American artifacts were placed in probable ritual contexts within African  American households. This pattern appears to represent a belief system that was  common among African Americans, and the special symbolism of Native American  items and hearths are subjects that warrant more study.</p>
      <h3><a name="symbols"></a>Bearers of American Patriotic  Symbols</h3>
      <p>Three types of artifacts from the  farmstead incorporate visual symbolism of the United States of America, and these  objects may have been valued possessions in the Williams family because of this patriotic association.  Two U.S. Army general service buttons were found; their faces are stamped  with the classic image of a spread-winged eagle with a stars-and-stripes shield  on its chest. The style of the eagle indicates they were manufactured between  1855 and 1884, and they may have been from a uniform that was used during the  Civil War or surplus sold after the war. There is no way to know whether Ransom  Williams acquired a U.S. Army jacket with the buttons on it, or only acquired  the military buttons. It is reasonable to assume, however, that he would have  been aware that these button were the same style worn by the Union soldiers who  helped emancipate the enslaved African Americans. He would also have been aware  that regiments of African American soldiers, some northern freedmen and some  escaped Southern slaves, had fought for the Union  and wore these buttons. As a  former slave who was probably 19 years old at emancipation, Williams may have believed that these military buttons  were symbolic of freedom and thus an important possession.</p>
      <p>The second artifact bearing a patriotic  symbol is the cheek plate of a snaffle bit with a distinctive U.S.  star-and-shield design. There is little doubt that Ransom Williams was an  accomplished horseman since he had his own horse brand and worked with horses  for more than 30 years. Like most horsemen, he probably took pride in his horse  gear, and the star-and-shield snaffle bit was the most ornate piece of horse  tack that was found. He could have obtained a secondhand bridle or bit and been  oblivious to the symbolism, but this seems unlikely. Rather,  Ransom probably selected this bit  intentionally because he was proud to display this patriotic symbol when riding his horse in  public.</p>
      <p>The third artifact with U.S. symbolism  is most intriguing. It is a commemorative spoon, manufactured to honor Captain  Sigsbee and the battleship USS Maine that sank in Havana Harbor  in February 1898. This was a critical event in the buildup to the  Spanish-American War, and most adult American men would have been aware of this  important national news.   The item may indicate that Ransom Williams kept up  with current political affairs and wanted to display his patriotism and  support for the U.S.  war effort. In addition, he was probably well aware that many African American  soldiers fought and died in the Spanish-American War, and this may have been a  source of pride for him as well. Ironically, Ransom purchased the commemorative spoon  less than three years before he died.</p>
      <h3><a name="network"></a>Participants  in a Regional African-American Economic Network</h3>
      <p>The Williams family was typical of many American consumers  in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and their material remains  denote their success in  farming endeavors. As African Americans, however, their success was exceptional,  given the restrictions imposed on their freedom and social  interactions during the post-emancipation, Jim  Crow era. Blacks in the post-war South cooperated with whites economically,  but their relationships were seldom on the social level, at least not in  public. Blacks attended segregated churches, went to segregated schools, and  followed a strict set of rules for how they should behave and interact with  whites on a day-to-day basis. Like the rest of the South, central Texas was a highly  segregated and discriminatory society, and the Williams family had to deal with  this reality. </p>
      <p>Within this context of mandated social segregation, African  Americans not only congregated into their own communities, but they also sought  to create their own businesses and economies. Whenever possible, black  consumers tried to do business with black-owned enterprises; they would buy  products manufactured by blacks or black-owned firms, and use the services  provided by blacks. In addition, blacks also sought to do business with  national and local companies that were friendly to the African American  community, especially those firms that catered to black consumers through  advertising.</p>
      <p>Two  lines of evidence from the farmstead indicate the Williams family was indeed connected to a  regional African American economic network and even  consumers of African-American-made products. In both cases, the evidence  involves interpreting artifacts from the farmstead in light of historical  evidence. </p>
      <p>Archeologists found numerous  stoneware sherds  at the Williams farm that, looked quite similar to some of the stoneware  made at the Wilson potteries near Seguin, Texas. These historic potteries&#8212;among  the earliest African American-owned businesses in Texas&#8212;were operated by brothers Hiram and James Wilson, both former slaves of the Rev. John McKamey Wilson, who founded the first  pottery-making enterprise there in 1857. Although we know very  little about the distribution and marketing of their wares, the Wilson potteries operated  for many decades, and their pots were widely distributed. It is reasonable to  suggest that after 1865 the Wilson potteries  would have distributed their wares to white-owned and black-owned retail stores  throughout the central Texas  region.</p>
      <p>To determine if the four reconstructed stoneware vessels from the farmstead were from the Wilson Pottery, a sourcing study  (Neutron Activation Analysis) was conducted on the sherds to compare their chemical constituents to samples from the pottery and other sites.  This involved a statistical analysis of 32 elements to define the chemical clusters. Based on  findings from the analysis of 50 sherds, we can tentatively say that the four pots from the farmstead were made at one  of the Wilson potteries. If correct, this interpretation is significant for African  Diaspora studies because it denotes a specific type of consumer behavior among  late-nineteenth-century freedmen, and it demonstrates that rural freedmen  farmers in central Texas were participants in a larger regional economic  network that involved black-owned businesses. </p>
      <p>Another line of evidence suggests the Williams family patronized businesses that marketed to the African-American community. Seven bottles found at the Williams farmstead  bear the name of the Morley Brothers Drugstore or one of its products. The  Morley Brothers started their business in downtown Austin in 1874, and they advertised regularly  in  African American newspapers in the 1890s. </p>
      <p>In conjunction with the  Williams farmstead artifact analysis, University of Texas archeologist Nedra Lee  reviewed five different African American newspapers published in Austin from 1868 to1907, looking for historical evidence  of how the news media influenced the freedmen communities and the identities of  black Texans. She  recorded each paid advertisement that appeared in 135 issues. This data turned  out to be quite useful for interpreting the artifacts recovered at the Williams  farmstead. We discovered there was a strong correlation between many of the  glass bottles that were found at the farm and several specific products that were advertised  in the newspapers.</p>
      <p>Although members of the Williams family likely did not read advertisements for products in the Austin newspapers, they would have  still been connected to the local African American economic network. They were  linked to the larger freedmen community through church, their kids attending  school, social events (such as Juneteenth celebrations), and through the local  stores they would have patronized. All of these factors would have steered them  toward doing business within their own community and informed them of the large  economic sphere of black-owned and black-friendly businesses. </p>
      <h3><a name="migration"></a>The End of an Era: <br>
        The Williams Family and the Great  Migration</h3>
      <p>The question of why the Williamses  left their farm and eventually sold the land that they had owned and worked for  decades is an important one. For the Williams family&#8212;and similarly for many blacks living in rural areas at the time&#8212;the  answer is rooted in specific and general historical circumstances: the death of the  head of a household; severe or extended droughts; an unfavorable local economy;  unfavorable changes in laws, especially the passage of Jim Crow laws that  limited the freedoms of blacks in Southern states; unfair or hostile treatment  by landlords; and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and an increased threat of  violence. </p>
      <p>As racial discrimination and economic hardships intensified in the decades following Reconstruction, many African Americans began  moving from rural to urban areas and, on a larger scale, from the South to the  North. Historian Louis Kyriakoudes terms this a southern variant of the Great Migration and notes that the urbanization  of black southerners began as a slow trickle in the 1890s, rising to a torrent  during and after World War I.   In their  book, <em>Homecoming: The Story of African  American Farmers</em>, Charlotte Gilbert  and Quinn Eli  summarize the historical context of the Great  Migration, one of the  most significant mass migrations in human history:</p>
      <p><em>From the time of Reconstruction to the mid-twentieth  century, blacks in the South were perhaps more keenly aware than blacks in any  other part of the country of the failure of America&rsquo;s promise to provide  liberty and justice for all. In the years after the Civil War a systematic  attempt to strip African-Americans of the entitlements bestowed upon them in  1865 by the Emancipation Proclamation left many blacks in positions of poverty  and servitude that resembled exactly the circumstances they had endured as  slaves. For this reason a good many of them fled the South. They left in  droves. Despite the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment ended slavery and the  Fourteenth Amendment mandated that all persons born in the Unites States were  to enjoy full citizenship and equal rights under the law, many Southern states  refused to acknowledge these laws, thereby forcing a number of African-Americans  to look elsewhere for a better quality of life. </em></p>
      <p>This massive migration, which  included moving from rural to urban and from the South to the North, was  triggered by a number of key historical events of the late-nineteenth century.  Gilbert and Eli aptly describe this torrent of events: </p>
      <p><em>The reckless disregard by whites of the Civil Rights Acts  of 1866 and 1875, the withdrawal of federal troops from the South in 1877, the  various political disfranchisement activities of the early 1890s, and the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896  cumulatively and profoundly affected the lives of black farmers. Each new  setback seemed to do more damage than the one before, and eventually all the  setbacks began to feel like a hard, swift, single blow to the heart of every  Southern black farmer. </em></p>
      <p>Thousands  of black people left their farms and headed to the cities. Historians have long  debated the many reasons this occurred, but escaping racial discrimination and  the threat of mob violence are always high on any list.  The 1922 book, <em>The Negro in Chicago: A Study of Race Relations and a Race  Riot</em>, contains an entire chapter devoted to the &ldquo;Migration of Negroes from  the South.&rdquo; It  lists the following conditions in the South as contributing  factors to the Great Migration: high rent and low wages, the boll weevil, lack  of capital and poor credit system, unsatisfactory living conditions, lack of  school facilities, lack of protection from mob violence, injustice in the  courts, inferior transportation facilities (i.e., the baggage cars on trains  were called &ldquo;Jim Crow cars&rdquo;), deprivation of the right to vote, &ldquo;rough-handed&rdquo;  and unfair competition of &ldquo;poor whites&rdquo;, persecution by petty officers of the  law, and persecution of the Press. In a nutshell, African Americans who lived in towns  and cities had better prospects, better jobs, and more business opportunities  than their African American counterparts living in rural areas. </p>
      <p>When the Williamses left their  family farm around 1905, they were simply reacting to their own particular  circumstances and local conditions. They were participants in the Great  Migration along with thousands of other African Americans in Texas who made similar choices in similar  circumstances. It is doubtful that anyone in the Williams family understood the historical  significance of the massive migration that was happening all around them. That  kind of perspective would not be possible until long after these events had  passed.</p>
      <p>By the dawn of the twentieth  century, things looked a lot different on the Williams farm. Ransom was older  too, and his body may have been exhausted after a lifetime of hard work, first  as an enslaved laborer and then as a freedman farm owner. Ransom was probably  55 years old when he died in 1901. Severe droughts in central Texas that year may have been an added  stress that contributed to his death. He left behind his widow Sarah, aged 50,  and their oldest children Will, 25; Charley, 23; Mary 19; Henry, 18; and  Mattie, 16, to work the farm and help raise their younger siblings (John, 12,  and Emma, 9). But a year earlier, oldest son, Will, had married Clara Franklin,  and the couple moved away to Creedmoor to begin their new lives together; they  had their first child by 1903. The fate of the next oldest sons is unknown:  Charley disappears from the records after 1904, and we think he may have died  by 1906. Henry died in 1911 at age 28, and the official cause of death was:  &ldquo;Heart failure, produced by stab would in left leg over 1 year ago.&rdquo;  Regardless, all evidence indicates that by 1905 Sarah and the younger children  had left the old farmstead and moved to the black community in east Austin. Like many  thousands of rural blacks throughout the South, the Williamses had given up the  agricultural lifestyle and become urban dwellers.</p>
      <p>Although they had left the farm, the  Williams family continued to own their land for many years. In 1901, the family  farm consisted of the original 45-acre farmstead plus 12 acres of adjacent  farmland that the older boys, Will and Charley, had purchased in 1900. But  Charley sold his 6 acres in 1902, and Will and his wife Clara sold their 6  acres in 1905. When Sarah died in 1921, her children inherited the farm, which  was back to the original 45 acres. They kept the property together for a few  more years, but sold off a 2/5 portion of the estate in 1934 and the remaining  3/5 portion in 1941. If Will and Clara were living and farming with her family  in Creedmoor by 1903 and Charley had died by 1906, then there were no adult  males left to run the farm. This suggests that the Williamses rented their farm  to someone else from 1905 through 1941. In any case, the archeological evidence  shows that no one lived on the original farmstead after ca. 1905. </p>
      <p>One wonders what the Williams  children thought when they finally sold off the last of the old farmstead in  1941. Maybe it had become a liability, and they were happy to get rid of it.  Perhaps they were reluctant but had to sell it for financial reasons. In any  case, it might have been a sad day for Will and his siblings because they knew  they were parting with an important piece of their family history. It was the first  true home for their parents&mdash;the place where they earned their living, raised  their family, and created memories. But in a larger sense, the small farmstead  in Travis County had been a symbol of freedom for  Ransom and Sarah Williams, a part of their identities as American citizens.</p></td>

          <br>
          From tax records, we know that nearly every farm in the area, large and small, grew some cotton and corn. Cotton was a cash crop, and it may have been Ransom's most important source of outside income each year.</p>

Smith was published in the March 1920 issue of The Crisis, the official magazine for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It depicts a black man running away to the North to escape the violence in the South. The same issue of The Crisis stated that in the 31 years from 1889 to 1919, 3,808 persons were lynched in the United States, and 68 percent of them were Negroes (2,549 men and 51 women). Texas  had more than its share of lynchings and mob violence against blacks.<br>
