      <p>By 1726 the mission was in operation at its 
	third location.  The friars had been encouraged by reports of Indian groups that expressed enthusiasm for a Spanish mission.  
	The area selected was described as having good water, an abundance of timber, suitable land for 
	cultivation, and plenty of stone for construction. The new mission would serve the Aranama and Tamique 
	Indians and was to be located on the south bank of the Guadalupe River just west of  Presidio La Bahia. This mission was in use until 1749 when it was moved a final time to a spot along the 
	San Antonio River in Goliad County.  </p>
      <p class="style1 style1">Historical records documenting the third location of Espíritu Santo in the area today referred to as Mission Valley are scarce.  Although a number 
	of documents mention the mission and its location, the majority of the records focus on military 
	matters at the related Presidio La Bahia on the other side of the Guadalupe River. No maps, for 
	example, of the layout of the mission have yet been found. Furthermore, little to no information is 
	written about the daily lives of the friars or the mission Indians.  </p>
      <p class="style1 style1">The archeology of Espíritu Santo at Mission Valley, 
	  therefore, is critical for understanding  the arrangement of the mission structures and for 
	  gaining insight into the everyday lives of the people that resided here.  Furthermore, archeology can address many questions rarely addressed through historical records, as well as produce physical evidence of 
	  the acculturation process and/or the persistence of native traditions. </p>
      <p><span class="style1 style1">A</span>rcheological investigations at the site were led by Thomas R. Hester, professor of anthropology and director of TARL at the University of Texas at Austin, and Tamra Walter, then a graduate student  at UT-Austin. Two field schools of the Texas Archeological Society as well as a UT-Austin field school were conducted at the site, with work focused on several components of the mission complex. The 
	information recovered from these investigations yielded data concerning the mission structures, the 
	mission Indian "quarters", the sandstone quarry, a lime kiln, two diversion dams, and an acequia 
	system. </p>
      <p>In all, the remains of five mission buildings were documented including the friar's quarters, the mission 
	  church, an apse, and possible refectory or kitchen. All of these buildings were constructed from 
	  sandstone taken from a quarry about 1 km (.6 miles) south of the mission ruins. </p>
      <p>Large-scale excavations outside 
	  the immediate area of the mission structures where many of the neophytes probably camped while staying 
	  at the mission were conducted in order to recover information about these native residents.  The 
	  artifacts recovered from these investigations included bone-tempered pottery, large quantities of 
	  animal bone and freshwater mussel shell, scrapers, Guerrero arrow points, drills, small bits of metal, 
	  a few Spanish Colonial ceramic sherds (including majolicas and lead-glazed earthenwares), and several 
	  glass trade beads.</p>
	  <p>The discovery of an almost completely intact limekiln approximately 100 yards northeast of the 
	mission ruins provided a unique opportunity to examine another aspect of the mission complex. Locally 
	available caliche rock was collected and reduced in this kiln and probably others primarily in order 
	to make lime for the production of mortar.  This simple, updraft subterranean bank kiln represents a 
	unique feature that is rarely found in such an excellent state of preservation at sites from the 
	Spanish Colonial period. Its construction and use reflects the importance of erecting permanent 
	structures of stone at the site.  Lime was often considered more desirable for the long-lasting 
	success of stone buildings like those built at Espíritu Santo. The collection of caliche and the 
	operation of the kiln likely were jobs carried out by the mission Indians who provided the bulk of 
	the labor force.</p>
	  <p>From historical records, we know that almost immediately after the move to Mission Valley was 
	completed, construction on a dam and acequia was underway.  Despite considerable efforts and countless 
	hours invested in the building and maintenance of two dams (one built along Mission Creek and the 
	other along the Guadalupe River) and more than a mile of canals, attempts at irrigation were 
	unsuccessful. Periods of drought and flooding during the beginning years of the mission are believed 
	to be the major cause for the failure of the dams and acequia system.  </p>
	  <p>After abandoning attempts to 
	  irrigate their crops in 1736, the missionaries turned to dry farming which proved to be much more 
	  successful.  Again, the neophytes were most likely the individuals who were responsible for 
	  constructing and maintaining the dams and acequia.  As with most Spanish missions, the missionaries 
	  trained the Indians in farming, herding, and other vocations as a part of the conversion or "civilizing" process.  The mission Indians were expected to labor in the fields and herd cattle in a 
	  concerted effort by the friars to make the mission self-sustaining and eventually profitable.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>The Indians of the Mission </h3>
	<p>While historical records tell us that the Aranama and Tamique Indians were the main indigenous 
	groups to occupy the Mission Valley location of Espíritu Santo, they provide little else in regards 
	to their ways of life, religion, and social organization. There are a few historic and ethnohistoric 
	accounts that relate some information about the Aranama but even fewer provide details about the 
	Tamique who are believed to be a sub-group of the Aranama. </p>
	<p>Most scholars agree that the Aranama were 
	  a group of hunter-gatherers that lived near the Guadalupe River Valley.  Both groups are thought to 
	  have lived in small, nomadic bands and hunted deer and bison. During an inspection tour of the area 
	  in the 1720's, Pedro de Rivera (1727) describes the native inhabitants at Espíritu Santo as pagans who 
	  wore animal skins of bison and deer.  A later account in 1854 provided by an early settler of Victoria 
	  depicts the Aranama as "a temperate class of aborigines that "did not indulge in the use of ardent 
	  spirits" and who were fond of painting their faces and bodies.</p>
	<p>When the mission was moved for the final time to the San Antonio River near present-day Goliad, the Aranama and Tamique 
	continued to make up the majority of the Indian groups residing there. While at the mission, the 
	neophytes were trained in both farming and ranching and a number of the mission Indians became quite 
	skilled as vaqueros.  Typically men worked in the fields or tended cattle while women cared for 
	children at home or were taught to spin and weave cotton and wool. </p>
	<p>The daily routine of the mission 
	  included prayers, mass, work, and meals. This routine was enforced by the friars with help from Indian 
	  overseers and a few presidio soldiers stationed at the mission to help in the instruction of the 
	  neophytes.  For many of the formerly nomadic Indians, this strict ordering of life proved too taxing 
	  and as a result it was not uncommon for many of them to abandon the mission only to be brought back 
	  by search parties made up of presidio soldiers.  </p>
	<p>While things did improve at Mission 
	    Valley after the abandonment of the acequia system in 1736, the Aranama and Tamique did not appear to 
	    be permanent residents as is reflected in the lack of stone Indian barracks.  Although a few trusted 
	    Indians may have lived year-round at the mission, the vast majority continued to camp outside the 
	    compound walls, apparently incorporating the mission into their seasonal movements as food supplies at 
	    Espíritu Santo permitted. This situation changes at the fourth location of the mission where a number 
	    of stone buildings were constructed and served as mission Indian quarters.</p>
	<p>Despite accounts that estimate the congregation of 400 Aranama and Tamique Indians at the time of 
	its founding, the third location of the mission probably never sustained that number for long.  The 
	first years of operation at Mission Valley were plagued with troubles.  The padres were undersupplied 
	and had to use their own monies to help support the missionary effort, food was scarce, and their 
	crops were failing.  Promises to feed and protect the natives may have been enough initially to entice 
	these groups to live and work at Espíritu Santo but eventually the missionaries had to turn them away 
	when supplies ran short.  </p>
	<p>Interestingly, the archeological evidence indicates that the Spaniards may 
	  have been relying more on the Indians for subsistence in those early years.  The remains of a variety 
	  of local wild fauna including deer, freshwater fish, rabbit, turtle, and opossum found within the 
	  walls of the mission compound suggest that the friars may have supplemented their diet with foods 
	  brought by the Aranama and Tamique. Furthermore, given the lack of durable goods available to the 
	  mission, it is not surprising that bone-tempered pottery, produced by the mission Indians, constitutes
	   more than 90% of the entire ceramic assemblage.</p>
	<p>Investigations in the mission Indian "quarters" have provided the most information regarding the 
	 native occupants of Espíritu Santo thus far. Archeological evidence of native occupation consists 
	 mainly of mission Indian material culture and a number of features located outside the confines of 
	 the mission compound.  The features include small hearths and piles of discarded mussel shell and 
	 animal bone representing the remains of meals prepared by the mission Indians. Analysis of the 
	 materials recovered from this area indicates that neophytes continued to hunt and gather local fauna 
	 and make and use stone tools including scrapers, drills, blades, and beveled knives. Spanish goods 
	   and domesticated animals are also present in the mission Indian assemblage although in much smaller 
	   quantities.</p>
	 <p> In general, it appears that their diet did not change significantly at this early date 
	     regardless of the access to new, domesticated animals introduced by the Spaniards. As the cattle
	      herds grew and the mission became more self-sufficient during the later years at Mission Valley, 
	      however, domesticated foods may have become more important to the mission Indian diet.</p>
	 <p>Likewise the use of stone tools does not appear to have changed greatly during this period and 
	  the toolkit used by the natives is very similar to Late Prehistoric toolkits with the exception of 
	  the Guerrero projectile point.  The Guerrero point type makes its appearance in the archeological 
	  record during the Spanish Colonial era in south Texas and Northeastern Mexico and is most commonly 
	  found in mission Indian middens and Spanish Ranchos.   Clearly, stone continued to be important for 
	  the manufacture of tools although it should be noted that metal was generally scarce during the 18th 
	  century in Texas thus accounting for some of the continued dependency on stone. </p>
	  <p>To date, the archeology at Espíritu Santo has yielded information regarding changes in native 
	  diet and technologies. Both the Spanish and the Indians were impacted by the mission experience and 
	  change was felt by all parties involved in its history. The missionaries relied on native products 
	  such as ceramic wares and may have supplemented their diets with local game provided by the mission 
	  Indians.  </p>
	  <p>The Aranama and Tamique, on the other hand, continued to a certain degree to practice 
	    traditional lifeways including the use and production of stone tools, the hunting and gathering of 
	    local flora and fauna, and scheduled seasonal rounds dictated by the mission's available food 
	    resources.  The continued use of stone tools can be interpreted as an attempt to hold on to 
	    conventional ways of life or a necessity or perhaps a bit of both.  As seen in the faunal assemblage,
	     the mission diet reflects a certain reliance on native species during the early years of the 
	     mission's operation when resources were scarce. As the mission herds grew however, beef may have 
	     played a much larger role in the diet of the mission residents.</p>
	  <p>Obviously both the native and Spanish occupants of Espíritu Santo were experiencing rapid 
	   changes as a result of cultural exchanges between the two groups.  It is important to note, however,
	    that although it may appear that certain aspects of native culture persisted unchanged the 
		political and social contexts in which these traditional practices occurred was vastly different 
		from that of the pre-Hispanic era. European diseases profoundly effected native populations in the 
		New World including those of South Texas. Furthermore, groups such as the Apache were encroaching 
		upon the established hunting territories of the Aranama and Tamique as well other bands in the 
		area disrupting their way of life.  </p>
	   <p>The continued use of certain items such as stone tools at 
		  Espíritu Santo or the use of metal implements was unquestionably affected by availability, 
		  necessity, and perhaps even social constraints. Mission life was without doubt structured and the 
		  friars certainly had rules regarding what was appropriate behavior for the neophytes.  The 
		  acceptance or rejection of Spanish traits is perhaps better described as a negotiation process 
		  between the Indians and the missionaries. The Aranama and Tamique were active participants in 
		  this cultural exchange trying to adjust to the changing sociopolitical landscape and perhaps 
		  preserve at least some elements of their traditional ways of life in the face of adversity.  
		  Archeological investigations are on-going at the mission. Ideally new information will help us 
		  address in more detail mission Indian life at Espíritu Santo and the strategies employed by the 
		  Aranama and Tamique to maintain their ethnic identities.</p>
