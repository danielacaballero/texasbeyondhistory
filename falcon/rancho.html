            <p class="text">In 1951, archeologists from the University of Texas 
              began emergency salvage operations along the Rio Grande river in 
              advance of construction crews working on the Falcon dam. Earlier, 
              UT survey teams under the direction of archeologist Jack Hughes 
              had identified several sites threatened with imminent destruction. </p>
            <p class="text">One of the sites was located on Porcion 55, the westernmost 
              porcion for the settlement of Mier, on the northern side of the 
              Rio Grande. In 1767, that porcion had been awarded to Juan Antonio 
              Leal. Spanning some 5,783.6 acres, the grant was considered to be 
              about average size. Leal and his family built at least four one-room 
              stone houses, set close together and about 350 feet away from the edge 
              of the Rio Grande. </p>
            <p class="text">The archeologists identified those structures as well 
              as two other one-room stone houses nearby; these were located closer to 
              the river, about 100 feet from the banks. Both of the areas appeared 
              to have been abandoned rather then destroyed, since there was no 
              evidence of burning. Over time the walls had collapsed inward, leaving 
              piles of rubble on top of the foundations. Both groups of houses 
              had a midden, or trash heap, a common disposal area for refuse. 
            </p>
            <p class="text"> All of the exposed foundation walls were excavated, 
              and several test pits and a trench were dug into one of the middens. 
              The other midden had been nearly destroyed by dam construction crews 
              before it could be investigated. From their excavations, archeologists 
              recovered a variety of Spanish Colonial artifacts including household 
              items and children's toys.</p>
            <p class="text">Construction techniques used for the rancho site structures 
              were fairly typical for the area. The house walls had been made 
              of sandstone blocks, probably quarried locally, and the gaps in 
              between the large blocks had been filled with smaller stones. The 
              rock walls had then been coated with a type of limestone plaster 
              on both sides. The roofs probably were made of thatch and supported 
              by wooden beams laid across the stone walls. There were no windows; 
              the only openings were the heavy wooden door and small holes in 
              the walls, used as gunports. The lack of openings was clearly a 
              defensive measure; Indian raids were a continual threat to the settlers 
              in the isolated areas north of the Rio Grande.<br>
            </p>
                  <p class="text">While archeological survey and excavation was 
                    underway, additional sites in the area were documented. Photographs 
                    of Spanish Colonial structures soon to be submerged were taken 
                    by Alex Krieger, Jack Humphreys, and Jack Hughes. Joe Cason 
                    of UT compiled three notebooks of data over the field season, 
                    including rough line sketches of structures, archeological 
                    notes, and genealogical information on the area. In 1961, 
                    this treasure trove of information was brought together by 
                    architect and UT-San Antonio professor Eugene George in a 
                    study of historic architecture of the Falcon Reservoir area. 
                    Many of the architectural elements he documented, from <i>galerias 
                    </i>to <i>patios</i>, still infuse south Texas architectural 
                    styles today.</p>
