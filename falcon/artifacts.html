            <p class="text">Among the stone ruins and scattered across the surface 
              of the site, archeologists found a variety of artifacts from eighteenth-century 
              rancho life. There was an array of pottery cooking vessels and tableware 
              of varied designs. Small personal objects such as a child's whistle, 
              marbles buttons, and jewelry are a reminder of the families that 
              lived there. A small child-sized bowl with an &quot;X&quot; inscribed 
              on the bottom also was found. </p>
			   
            <p class="text">Many of the artifacts are general household items 
              used in everyday rancho life. The ceramics are mostly unglazed utilitarian 
              ware, such as jars and pots used to hold water and store dry goods. 
              There are also small bowls used for a variety of purposes, including 
              cooking over an open fire. Many of these unglazed ceramics were 
              handmade, probably by experienced local potters. The glazed wares 
              were also utilitarian in nature, but they were used as pitchers, 
              mixing bowls, and sometimes cooking vessels. </p>
			  
            <p class="text">The finer red and black glazed ware and majolica of 
              various colors and designs were used as tableware&#151;dishes, bowls, 
              cups, and serving dishes. All of these glazed ceramics were imported 
              from various places in Mexico, and were brought to the Santander 
              area on mule train. <i>Chocolateras</i>, or chocolate cups, were 
              extremely popular in Spanish Texas, and were painted with brown 
              and black swirl designs. These cups were also imported from northern 
              Mexico. An unusual variant of this design is a chocolatera that 
              was glazed with green rather than the usual clear glaze.</p>

	<p class="text">A group of smooth, oval-shaped stones is somewhat 
              unusual; the purpose or use for these is unknown. Some look like 
              hammerstones used for making chipped-stone tools, but they have 
              no impact marks on the edges or tips. Most are flat, round or oval 
              in shape, and vary in size from 2 to 10 cm. All are hand-sized and 
              may have been used as smoothing stones for making pottery. During 
              the pottery-making process, potters typically smooth the surfaces 
              of clay vessels with a stone to even out the thickness and create 
              a burnished surface before firing the pot. On the other hand, the 
              stones may have been gaming pieces. </p>
            
        <p class="text">Metal artifacts were scarce, but several pieces of 
              iron and scraps of copper were found; these may have been used to 
              repair copper pots or other items. Some of the iron fragments may have been 
              gun parts. A few tacks were found but no nails or other construction 
              materials were found, which is unusual for a site with existing buildings.</p>
            <p class="text">In the midden and in the house floors, investigators 
              uncovered a large quantity of mussel shell, animal bones (cow, horse, 
              sheep, and javelina), and charred corn cobs. These items give us 
              an idea of what the diet of these early ranchers may have been as 
              well as indications of their resourcefulness. Mussels may have been 
              a food source in hard times, but the shell itself was probably used 
              to make lime. Lime was an ingredient in making plaster and mortar, 
              and it also probably was used to repair cracks in pottery.</p>
            <p class="text">The photographs of artifacts on these pages were taken 
              by Milton Bell. Artifacts and records of the Leal rancho excavations 
              are housed at TARL.</p>
