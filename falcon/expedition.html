            <p class="text">Expedition leader Jose de Escand&oacute;n handpicked 
              the locations for the new colonies, consisting of civilian cattle 
              ranching <i>haciendas</i> (headquarters), <i>villas</i> (towns), 
              and <i>lugars</i> (settlements). The colonists were drawn from neighboring 
              provinces and were exempt from taxes for the first 10 years. </p> 
            <p>Four villas were founded along the Lower Rio Grande, including Camargo (founded March 5, 1749) Reynosa (founded March 14, 1749), and Revilla (founded October 10, 1750) located on the south side of the Rio Grande, and Laredo on the north side of the river (founded May 15, 1755). In addition, on August 22, 1750, Escand&oacute;n granted Jos&eacute; V&aacute;zquez Borrego permission to found Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores on the north side of the Rio Grande, which soon became more of a small hacienda rather than a villa. One of the settlements established by the expedition was called Mier, founded on March 6, 1753 near the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Rio Alamo; it is now on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.</p>
            <h3>Ranchos along the River</h3>
            <p class="text">Mier was founded to be the central settlement for 
              a series of ranchos that occupied the land surrounding the town 
              on both sides of the river. Thirty-eight families were brought up 
              from Cerralvo, Nuevo Leon, and joined 19 families already in the 
              area. Each settling family was awarded a <i>porcion</i>, or land 
              grant, that consisted of a narrow strip of land containing from 0.5 to 1 
              mile of riverfront property and extending about 14 to 15 miles away 
              from the Rio Grande. </p>
            <p class="text">Families were also given a small plot in town to build 
              a house, if they wished. Many of the buildings on each porcion were 
              placed near the Rio Grande, just far enough away to avoid flooding, 
              and the rest of the land was used for sheep, goats, and cattle. 
              No fences were used, and the animals could roam as they pleased 
              across porciones. Cattle belonging to different owners would often 
              merge together into large herds, and would only be separated during 
              a <i>rodeo</i>, or roundup. To some extent, this was done as a defensive 
              measure against Indian raids. To protect the cattle, ranchers allowed 
              them to roam free, making them a less obvious target. <br>
            </p>
            <h3>Cattle-raising in the Eighteenth Century</h3>
            <p class="text">Cattle-raising operations in southern Texas and Northern 
              Mexico usually fell into two general categories. The rancho was 
              a small rural estate that was worked by the owner and his family 
              who both farmed and raised livestock. They held only a few thousand 
              acres of land and a few thousand cattle. Their owners were considered 
              part of the &quot;middle class&quot; of Spanish Colonial society. 
              Another form of ranching centered on the big hacienda, a large, 
              rural, self-sufficient estate. Hacienda families were involved in 
              cattle raising, sheep and goat herding, agriculture, or mining&#151;anything 
              that could be produced and sold for a profit. The hacienda could 
              occupy hundreds of thousands of acres and have tens of thousands 
              of cattle. The <i>patr&oacute;n</i>, or owner, of the hacienda was 
              a member of the upper class, enjoying wealth, prestige, and political 
              influence. His workers, the <i>vaqueros</i> (cowboys), and their 
              families were members of the lower class, the <i>pe&oacute;n</i>, 
              and were usually bound by debt to the patr&oacute;n. Several true 
              haciendas were in operation in northern Mexico and later in Texas 
              in the nineteenth century, but no haciendas of that scale were ever located along 
              the Rio Grande, only small haciendas or ranchos.</p>
            <p class="text">The ranching families maintained a strong connection 
              to the town. It was a place to gather supplies, go to church, and 
              attend festivals, weddings, baptisms, and other celebrations. It 
              was a place where the men could meet with the other ranchers in 
              the community, discuss political and social issues, and plan out 
              the next rodeo.</p>
