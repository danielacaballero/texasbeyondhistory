            <p class="text">Throughout the eighteenth century, the Spanish made expeditions 
              into the area we now call Texas to set up missions and<i> presidios</i> 
              (military forts). They were designed to convert the native inhabitants 
              to Christianity and to maintain a presence on the land they claimed 
              for Spain. San Antonio also became an administrative center for 
              the area, growing into a town that housed military leaders and government 
              officials as well as artisans, ranchers, missionaries, Native Americans, 
              slaves, and servants. However, before the mid-eighteenth century, 
              there were no Spanish settlements that were made up of just civilian 
              families who made a living off the land. That was soon to change. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">In 1748, Jos&eacute; de Escand&oacute;n led a Spanish 
              expedition to colonize the Province of Nuevo Santander. This was 
              a portion of land uninhabited by the Spanish at the time. Located northeast 
              of Nuevo Leon along a portion of the Gulf of Mexico, it incorporated 
              


lands between the Nueces River and the present-day boundary of Tampico, and included the southernmost portion of the Rio Grande. The expedition was to 
              be the first civilian-only settlement in Texas. The colonists were 
              farmers and ranchers, who moved north to try to build a new and 
              better life. The techniques and equipment they brought with them 
              became the standard for ranching operations in Texas and the West 
              well into the twentieth century.</p>
            <p class="text">Although stories of these early ranchers have been 
              passed down through the centuries to their descendants, relatively 
              little has been written or published for a wide audience. There 
              is a wealth of historic records in small archives such as courthouses 
              and family collections, but these handwritten documents are often 
              difficult to read and translate.</p>
            <p class="text">The area's first settlers, however, did leave tangible 
              information <i>in the ground, </i>some of which was recovered and studied by archeologists. For example<i>, </i>archeologists from the University of Texas 
              managed to excavate one of the rancho sites in 1950 and 1951 before it was completely 
              destroyed by the creation of Falcon Reservoir. From the structural 
              ruins and household debris emerged a poignant glimpse of day-to-day 
              life in the Spanish Colonial borderlands. <strong>It was the first rancho 
              excavated in Texas.</strong></p>
            <p class="text">The following sections on the Falcon Reservoir area trace the area's settlement, with a detailed look at the Leal rancho and the information recovered from archeological investigations. We also look at the area after the innundation of Falcon Reservoir and the toll taken on on archeological sites 
            as the waters periodically rise and fall. </p>
            <p class="text">This exhibit is  the first of several in the region we hope to provide on <i>Texas 
                Beyond History.</i> In the  future, we hope to trace personal stories of the inhabitants through oral histories and explore the rich 
                architectural legacy that still survives in the region's small towns 
                and rural areas. We will also look back at some of the structures 
                that have been lost to time and modern development. <br>
