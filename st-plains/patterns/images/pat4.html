  <p><strong><em>Clusters of offerings</em></strong><em> were placed in many  of the graves at Loma Sandia. Usually tightly stacked together, these  items&mdash;ranging from chipped-stone tools and projectile points to perforated  shell pendants&mdash;may have been enclosed in leather pouches or fiber bags that  deteriorated and disappeared over time. Most of these items are&ldquo; utilitarian&rdquo;  objects used in daily life, although many such objects were placed in graves  while still in pristine shape, implying that they were &ldquo;new&rdquo; and unused. The  cluster shown at top left included four Tortugas dart points, five adzes (distally  beveled tools or gouges) probably used for woodworking, two chert cores,  several flake tools, one hammerstone, a mano (handstone for grinding), and a  piece of kaolin (pipestone). Black and white photos of some of these artifacts  are shown: Tortugas dart points (top right and center row) and distally beveled  tools (bottom row). &nbsp;UTSA-CAR archives. </em></p>
