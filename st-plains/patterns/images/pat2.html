  <p><strong><em>Chipped stone bifaces</em></strong><em> were placed in tight  clusters with several interments at Loma Sandia. Others, such as the group  shown, were not directly associated with a specific burial and may have been &ldquo;votive  offerings&rdquo; placed at the cemetery because it was a sacred site, perhaps  intended to honor ancestors during some later ritual occasion. Sometimes classified  as &ldquo;trade blanks&rdquo; (unfinished specimens intended for caching or carrying for  exchange), the large thin bifaces may have had special value and importance,  given the scarcity of chert suitable to make these artifacts in the South Texas  Plains. </em></p>

  <p><em>Examples of thin chert bifaces (knives) from burials  at Loma Sandia</em>. &nbsp;<em>Bifaces such as these had particular  significance to native peoples.&nbsp; Large  pristine examples are only found as burial offerings and special caches, which  are often isolated finds of hidden clusters that are not part of any  archeological site.&nbsp; In archeological  campsites, chert knives typically are found as heavily worn and down-sized  discards and broken pieces. In his travels through the region in the early 16th  century, Cabeza de Vaca reported that the Cutalchuches used large flint&nbsp; knives, some up to 12 inches long, to harvest  cactus. He was presented with one at the end of the harvest as a special gift. Photos  from UTSA-CAR archives.</em></p>
