<div class="caption"><em>About 2-3,000 years ago,</em> <strong><em>antler racks </em></strong><em>from white-tail deer<strong> </strong>were  carefully placed over certain burials, perhaps as a signature of status or  other symbolic distinction. This deer antler cluster was recovered in a grave  at Loma Sandia along with deer skull fragments, chipped stone tools, flakes,  and a mano (hand stone used for grinding). Whether the antler rack was originally  used as a headdress (such as that depicted in the painting) could not be  determined in this case because of the deterioration of the bone. Some burials  at other cemeteries were covered by many racks.&nbsp;  Given that deer was the number one big game animal hunted in the region  throughout most of prehistory (as it still is today), these animals must have  symbolized success.&nbsp; It is interesting to  note that antler rack offerings sometimes accompanied adult men, obviously the  main hunters, but they also have been found with women and children. This  suggests the ritual links were not as simple as honoring hunting success.&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo courtesy of UTSA-Center for Archaeological  Research.</em></div>
