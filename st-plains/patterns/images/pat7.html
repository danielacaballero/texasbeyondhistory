  <p><em>Large, flat, <strong>grinding  slabs</strong> were found covering several of the graves at Loma Sandia. These may  have been placed to protect the body or perhaps they were offerings. Large  grinding slabs would have been considered valuable artifacts because thin hard  pieces of sandstone were hard to find and required considerable effort to  transport on foot.&nbsp; The drawing on the  left shows a grinding slab found over the grave of a woman, which also  contained a mano, conch shell columella, and several untrimmed chert flakes.  Both sides of the slab were double-faceted, that is, there were two use-worn depressions  on each face of the slab. Interestingly, at Loma Sandia most of the graves  associated with grinding slabs were those of adult males (although sex could  not be determined for a number of individuals). Grinding is an activity typically  associated with women, based on historic accounts and traditional food  preparation still practiced in countries such as Mexico.
