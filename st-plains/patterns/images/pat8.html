  <p><em>&nbsp;<strong>Body  ornaments</strong>, such as shell pendants and necklaces, were found with burials  and may have been worn by participants during ceremonies as well. Most were  made from marine or freshwater mollusk shells, although hollow animal bones  were also commonly used. Ornaments on the top row are of conch shell and are  from the Olmos Dam cemetery site near San    Antonio. The shells at top left have been perforated  to create &nbsp;cross-shaped designs. At  right, conch shell columella have been made into pendants. At bottom left is a decorated  conch shell pendant from Loma Sandia. At bottom right, a necklace or strand of  bird bone beads from the Morhiss cemetery site in Victoria County.  Image credits: top row, left, Thomas R.
