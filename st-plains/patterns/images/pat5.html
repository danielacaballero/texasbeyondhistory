  <p><strong><em>Marine conch shells</em></strong><em>, from  the Busycon, or lightning whelk, were prized by prehistoric people for making  ornaments, such as pendants, disc beads, and gorgets. Along the coast where  there are no natural sources of stone, the strong inner columella of the shells  was also fashioned into tools such as adzes, scrapers and hammers. Inland, &nbsp;most conch shell is found as ornaments, rather  than tools. Both whole conch shells and the ornaments made from them were  placed in burials during prehistoric times, although such offerings seem to  have been placed with relatively few individuals, often with multiple offerings  of marine shell or other rare materials. At the Loma Sandia cemetery, only 18  conch specimens were recovered and these were associated with relatively few  individuals.&nbsp; Only 8 or fewer individuals  (some associations were unclear) out of the roughly 205 human burial had grave  offerings made of conch shell. &nbsp;Most of  the individuals were adults, both females and males. </em></p>
  <p><em>The grave offering  shown above contained four shell pendants and a largely complete conch shell,  as well as an antler baton (flaking tool), three Tortugas points, flakes, a hammerstone,  and a grinding slab fragment. Conch shell ornaments were traded to or obtained  by inland peoples living many days travel from the coast. &nbsp;For instance, a variety of decorated conch  shell ornaments were included as grave offerings in the Late Archaic cemetery  at Olmos Dam in Bexar   County, near the edge of  the Balcones Escarpment, some 125 miles from the coast.
