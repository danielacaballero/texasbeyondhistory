<h1>Toyah Horizon</h1>
	<p>The Toyah culture forms one of the latest and most fascinating chapters in the prehistory of a vast 
	area across central and southern Texas that spans some 200 miles east-west and over 300 miles north-south.  Based on preserved archeological evidence, peoples with a closely shared material culture, 
	including a distinctive set of stone tools and bone-tempered earthenware pottery, lived throughout 
	this area between about A.D. 1350 until after 1600.  This culture coincides with the period during 
	which bison herds “returned” and were periodically (probably seasonally) present in the general region
	 after centuries of absence, leading many researchers to believe that Toyah culture was based on bison
	  hunting.  Yet careful studies of the animal bones recovered from several excavated Toyah sites in the South Texas Plains have shown
	   that deer remained the number one big game prey.  It is clear that Toyah culture is a complex 
	   phenomenon that defies simple characterization. </p>

    <p>Most of the Toyah story takes place beyond the South Texas Plains to the north and west and is 
summarized in the Plateaus and Canyonlands exhibits (see<a href="../../../plateaus/prehistory/images/toyah.html" target="_blank"> Toyah Culture</a>).  But there are two well-documented Toyah sites from deep within the South Texas Plains that have given researchers insight into 
life during the period. In the late 1970s and early 1980s archeologists from the Center for Archaeological
 Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA-CAR) excavated the <strong>Hinojosa</strong> site (41JW8) near
  Alice and the <strong>Possum Hollow</strong> site (41LK201) near Three Rivers.  Both sites proved to be campsites with 
  well-preserved occupational layers left by Toyah groups.</p>   

    <p>The term <strong>Toyah Horizon</strong> was first applied to the Hinojosa site to call attention to the perception that 
the expressions of Toyah culture known in deep South Texas were part of a cultural phenomenon that quickly 
spread across a very broad geographic expanse.  Other archeologists have used the terms Toyah “phase,” 
Toyah “interval,” and Toyah “culture.” Here we will stick with Toyah Horizon because this cultural 
expression does seem to represent a rather abrupt intrusion into the region in the 14th century (1300s) of
 artifacts and technologies that were obviously developed elsewhere, outside the region. </p>

<p>For instance, at about the same time (or just before) the Toyah Horizon spreads across the South Texas 
Plains, the native peoples of the region adopted the habit of making a particular type of low-fired 
earthenware known as <strong>bone-tempered pottery</strong>.  Ceramic technology – the use of fire to transform clay into 
hard ceramic material, especially containers – had long been known elsewhere in North America, for 
hundreds of years.  But this  technology was not adopted in southern and central Texas until the 13th and 
14th centuries.   Exactly when the technology first appears in the region, or who it was that south Texas peoples 
learned the new technology from, is not known. Nor is it clear whether pottery making spread into south and 
central Texas from eastern Texas, far west Texas, or the Southern Plains, all areas where ceramics were 
made hundreds of years earlier.  Whatever the precise origins, a distinctive pottery making tradition took 
hold across the South Texas Plains by the outset of the Toyah Horizon.</p>

<p>Bone-tempered pottery was made by adding crushed animal bone to wet clay, probably deer or bison bones 
that had been charred first in a fire so they could be crushed into a dry chunky powder.  The bone is 
thought to “temper” or strengthen the clay as it dries. The pottery was made using the coil method and it 
was typically nicely smoothed and polished and sometimes decorated with a red-ochre slip or post-firing 
wash,  or, less commonly, with simple incised decorations.  It was fired in nothing more than a surface fire fueled by brush, 
grass, or perhaps even buffalo dung.  Firing temperatures were relatively low, resulting in  earthenware that was 
tan to gray to reddish in color, with frequent firing clouds and dark cores. Archeologists typically find 
only small pieces – potsherds often less than the size of a quarter. This low-fired earthenware broke easily and weathered badly when 
left on the surface.  Several vessels from the region have been partially or wholly reconstructed and 
include ollas (water jugs), simple bowls, and jars.  Ceramic pipe bowls and a few figurines are also 
known,  but rare. </p>

<p>The <strong>Toyah stone toolkit </strong>includes the Perdiz arrow point, beveled knives, end scrapers, and drills made
 from flakes. This toolkit was well suited for hunting (Perdiz points), butchering (beveled knives), and
  processing the hides (end scrapers) of deer as well as bison and antelope; the drills were probably used 
  to bore holes in wood and shell. In addition, blade technology reappears in the region after an absence 
  of over 12,000 years (since Clovis times). Using this specialized core reduction technique, parallel-sided flakes called &quot;blades&quot; are removed one after another from specially prepared cores. Not all Toyah groups adopted blade technology, but many did, 
   presumably  because this flintknapping technique allowed toolmakers to yield larger numbers of
  useful pieces (blades)  from  specially prepared cores than was possible 
  with conventional flintknapping methods. Perdiz points, flake tools, and small end scrapers were all
   made from blades (as well as from ordinary flakes).</p>
