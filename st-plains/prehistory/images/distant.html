<h1>Distant Connections</h1>
	<p>The hunting and gathering peoples who populated the South Texas Plains throughout prehistory  
	left no ruins like those of the settled farmers of Mexico or the American Southwest. Most of what remains are 
	artifacts made of stone, shell, pottery, and sometimes bone,  that have survived the ravages 
	of time.   It’s easy to think of these peoples being wholly occupied with their day-to-day, hand-to-mouth existence – so focused on necessity, that they lived in “isolation,” with no knowledge of the 
	world beyond their nearest neighbors.  Archeological evidence, however, clearly shows that trade and 
	exchange were very important to the native peoples of south Texas, beginning in Paleoindian times, and, as the above quote from Cabeza de Vaca demonstrates, well into the Historic era.  </p>  

    <p> Cabeza de Vaca’s narrative of his days as a trader, during which he traveled 40-50 
leagues inland, says that he brought  the hunters and gatherers  things that they “needed.”  
Yet is obviously the case that  the peoples of the interior could have gotten by without the items of marine shell. Such objects  must have had an importance  that went beyond the daily grind of food-collecting.  The 
peoples of the coast did need “flint for arrow points,” as de Vaca put it, because suitable stone was absent from the coastal strip. They also needed inland cane suitable for arrow shafts (and perhaps preferred bow-making wood).</p>

    <p>The Cabeza de Vaca account shows trade processes in place which may  date back thousands of years. His testimony suggests  that the role of trade and exchange was  handled by an itinerant merchants.  This would 
account for the presence, in numerous sites of the South Texas Plains,  of disc-shaped conch shell beads 
(“sea beads”),  conch columella pendants, and tools made from the shell “cores” he 
reported, such as shell adzes or knives.  
Shell tools while common along the coast ,are rarely found at inland sites, with the notable exception of the <a href="../../../morhiss/index.html" target="_blank">Morhiss 
site</a>.  The movement of coastal resources inland would also account for  the asphaltum sometimes found 
rubbed into incised bone designs, used as an adhesive to affix (haft) dart points to foreshafts, or used 
to patch or decorate bone-tempered pottery. </p>  

    <p>These sorts of “exotic” artifacts – marine shell and other coastal commodities—reflect a <strong>regional trade 
pattern</strong> that also extended into the Edwards Plateau and the Lower Pecos Canyonlands.    The same could be said for the 
presence of Edwards Plateau cache bifaces and other stone tools made of Edwards chert deep into the South 
Texas Plains.  One can imagine itinerant merchants operating from the Edwards Plateau down into south 
Texas and over into east Texas.   Again, the hunters and gatherers of the South Texas Plains didn’t 
really “need” these things.  They had flint and chalcedony, although in cobble form – but these large 
cache bifaces were needed to indicate status (and wealth?), and to be used in ritual and burial. Cabeza de 
Vaca learned of a mythical creature called Mala Cosa (“Bad  Thing”) who was said to carry a very large 
flint knife with which he inflicted wounds on humans.  </p>

    <p>There is, however, evidence of a distinct pattern of long-distance trade in southern Texas.   
Occasional artifacts from Mesoamerica, and more commonly, pieces of obsidian (volcanic glass) from as 
far away as Idaho and central Mexico.  The mechanisms that moved these artifacts into south Texas are not 
as easy to explain as the regional trade observed by Cabeza de Vaca and other early Spanish travelers.   
  <strong>Long-distance trade</strong> obviously involved intermediaries at several levels, specific trade routes, and a 
variety of “down   the line” exchange processes. </p> 

    <p>Archeologists often use the term “exchange” instead of “trade” because we don’t know if items were 
traded in some sort of barter system, like flint for shell for instance, or exchanged for other reasons.  Especially in the case of 
small rare items from far away, exotic items may have passed from group to group as part of social 
interactions to promote good relations and cement alliances.  Exotic “ritual” 
items may have also been part of the spread of religious beliefs.  Call it trade or exchange, things 
somehow made their way over thousands of miles across North America long before  horses made
 travel much faster.  Cabeza de Vaca’s first-hand experience around A.D. 1530 suggests that specialized 
 traders may well have been operating long before early historic times.</p>

    <p>Items that reached the South Texas Plains from afar include a few artifacts from Mesoamerican 
civilizations (such as ceramic spindle whorls), Alibates flint from the Canadian River in the 
Texas Panhandle, and, most commonly, <strong>obsidian</strong>.  Pieces of obsidian, a shiny and extremely sharp volcanic 
glass, have been found at more than a dozen south Texas sites, as well as observed in private collections. 
Generally, these are small flakes, arrow points, or fragments of dart points.  While the numbers of 
obsidian artifacts are relatively small, these can be utilized to 
discern ancient trade routes. </p> 

    <p>Using x-ray fluorescence or neutron activation analysis, most obsidian can be chemically distinguished 
(“fingerprinted” by rare trace minerals at the level of parts-per-million) and linked back to its original 
geological source or outcrop.  Any piece of obsidian in found in archeological contexts in Texas comes from beyond the state's borders, as no source of artifact-quality obsidian  
 occurs in the state. Geologists have recorded occurrences of very poor quality perlites 
and rhyolites in western Texas, but samples from these outcrops have been found to have 
chemical characteristics unlike any obsidian archeological specimens in the state.  </p>

    <p>Much of what we now know about the sources of obsidian artifacts found in Texas has been learned by the 
      <strong>Texas Obsidian Project</strong> (TOP).  This project began in 1970 as a modest effort to link four obsidian 
artifacts from Dimmit County in south Texas to their geological sources.  Prompted by an archeological 
graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley (author Tom Hester), a Berkeley geologist, Robert Jack, who 
specialized in x-ray   fluorescence (XRF) analysis of obsidian and other materials, agreed to analyze the 
Dimmit County specimens as part of his ongoing research.  TOP expanded from there. In the early l970s, 
with the aid of several Texas avocational archeologists, and especially with the help of Dee Ann Story, 
who then directed the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin. We 
were able to secure additional obsidian artifacts from various localities in Texas.</p>

    <p>The project expanded greatly in the late l970s, when a collaborative study was begun with Drs. Frank 
Asaro and Fred Stross, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley.  Asaro 
and Stross were pioneers in the area of obsidian trace element studies. In the study of Texas 
obsidians, they have used both XRF (non-destructive) and neutron activation analysis (NAA; which requires 
the destruction of a  piece of the artifact).   We secured many more specimens from throughout Texas, 
with help from a number of people – both professionals and avocationals—including more specimens from 
sites on the South Texas Plains. </p>

    <p>Our TOP project was one of a number of obsidian sourcing projects in the Southwest and western United 
States.	With the use of trace element analysis, archeologists have been able to identify hundreds of 
obsidian sources, and there is now a vast literature on obsidian sources and trade routes in California, 
the Southwest, and the Great Plains.  These studies have pointed to, for example, very early trade routes. Obsidian of Clovis age came from central Mexico and wound up at the <a href="../../../kincaid/index.html" target="_blank">Kincaid Shelter</a> on the northern edge of the South Texas Plains. And, while a number of 
Texas obsidian artifacts are of Archaic age, much of the obsidian trade was considerably later. Around 
A.D. 1400,  specialized traders operated out of trade centers like Pecos Pueblo in the Southwest. 
But, there were also traders operating in hunting and gathering cultures on the Plains.  Obsidian from 
Yellowstone, Wyoming (Obsidian Cliff) and Malad, Idaho, were moved via a north-south Plains trade network 
that extended well into southern Texas.</p>

    <p>The obsidian sample from the South Texas Plain now totals 15-20 artifacts. But, there are another dozen 
obsidian artifacts from the lower Rio Grande valley near the coast. The <a href="../../../brownsville/index.html" target="_blank">Brownsville Complex</a> of that area 
is particularly noted for the presence of a number of obsidian artifacts, as well as artifacts made from 
Mexican jadeite, and pottery vessels made in the Huasteca area.  We used to think that this was 
essentially a  Late Prehistoric  trade relationship between the hunters and gatherers of the Rio Grande 
Delta and the Late Postclassic  Huastec-related cultures 200 miles down the Mexico coast (and with  
outposts in the mountain ranges such as the Sierra de Tamaulipas).  </p>

<p>But, recent studies by Dr. Tiffany Terneny have demonstrated that such trade started much earlier, in 
the Late Archaic – well before Huastecan culture was established.  We have no solid evidence of what the 
Mexican traders wanted…perhaps salt from the beds of Delta lakes, shell artifacts, or dried fish of some sort.  We 
have no idea why the Delta hunters and gatherers wanted flakes of obsidian, artifacts of poor quality 
green jadeite, and in late times, large pottery vessels.  Much of this material, though not all of it, 
shows up with burials, and so the “need” may well have transcended any daily necessities of life.   It 
will take much  more work at the mouth of the Rio Grande and on the Gulf Coast and coastal  plains of 
Mexico to better delineate the kinds of exchange that were involved. </p> 

<p> North of the Rio Grande Delta on the South Texas Plains and along the coast, obsidian flakes, points, and bifaces have 
been found in several counties. Most are surface finds and  rarely can be dated with any precision. A 
heavily-beach rolled Clovis point from  Lavaca Bay is among the earliest obsidian artifacts.  Its source 
is not yet among those that have been identified, although a piece of obsidian from the same unknown 
source was found in Early Archaic contexts at site 41NU221 near Corpus Christi.  Archaic-style dart point 
fragments of obsidian are also known, one from southern Uvalde County (Otumba source) and another from 
Atascosa County (source unknown).  A point with its stem missing is recorded from Dimmit County, made of 
Malad (Idaho) obsidian.  In the same area, two elongate bifaces are sourced to Mexico (the poorly known 
Santa Teresa source in the state of Jalisco). Many of the other obsidian artifacts, some which cannot be 
dated, derive from the Malad source, including two Late Prehistoric corner-notched arrow points found at a site in McMullen County. Two tiny arrow points found at the same site have been sourced to southern New 
Mexico, suggesting that obsidian from different sources may have been traded together. </p>

<p>Overall, the obsidian of the South Texas Plains came from very distant  sources, ranging from 
central Mexico to   southeastern Idaho. The Malad source is located in southeastern Idaho, and obsidian 
from that source is found from Kansas and Oklahoma into the Choke Canyon Reservoir of south Texas (site 
41LK51).  Two important  New Mexico sources are Cerro del Medio and Cerro Toledo (sometimes referred to 
as "Valles Caldera" or Obsidian Ridge;) in the Valles and  Toledo volcanic calderas of the Jemez Mountains
 north of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  </p>

<p>Then, there are the several sources from deep in Mexico.  In the Rio Grande Valley, obsidian is 
identified from the sources at Cerro de las Navajas (Pachuca, Hidalgo), Ojos Zarcos (Queretaro), and 
especially Zacualtipan, Hidalgo, a source well known for its exploitation by the Huastecs.  </p>

<p>Up the Rio Grande and into the South Texas Plains, obsidian from the Otumba source is found (Zapata and
 southern Uvalde Counties), the Cerro de Las Navajas source (Starr County), and Santa Teresa, Jalisco, in 
 western Mexico (Dimmit County; and though outside the area, from a rockshelter in Terrell County, west 
 Texas).     </p>

<p>There are also  obsidian specimens for which we cannot yet determine the geologic 
source.  Their trace element patterns do not match any of the sources identified in Mexico or western 
North America.  These include the Clovis point from Lavaca Bay, a dart point distal fragment from 
Atascosa County, and a large biface from Webb   County.  </p> 

<p>With so few identified obsidian artifacts from the South Texas  Plains, it is difficult to point to 
possible trade routes.  The Delta- Huasteca connection has already been noted.  Malad (Idaho) obsidian
 occurs very commonly on the Edwards Plateau, clustering along its  eastern edge.  This probably
 represents a north-south trade route of the sort proposed by Tim Baugh and Fred Nelson for Late 
 Prehistoric Malad obsidian (A.D. 1100-1400), a trading pattern that persisted into Historic times.</p>

<p>What we can say for sure is that obsidian sourcing has proved that the prehistoric inhabitants of the 
South Texas Plains did have distant connections with peoples and places thousands of miles away.  And 
ideas and information must have passed far more easily and quickly than physical things.  Early historic 
accounts of native peoples on the South Texas Plains show that knowledge of far-away groups and of 
distant events spread much farther and faster than we might imagine. </p>
