<h1>Mortuary Traditions</h1>
	<p>The mortuary traditions or human burial patterns of the South Texas Plains give us 	
	fascinating and unique insights into prehistoric life.  Cemetery locations and 
	characteristics reflect how native groups used the landscape, how and when they 
	established territories, and where populations were concentrated.  Grave types and 
	associated offerings reflect ritual life and hint at religious beliefs.  Grave associations also tell us something about how people lived and how they were connected 
	by trade or exchange to peoples in other regions.  The physical and chemical 
	characteristics of human bones reflect ancient diet and health. Indeed, when properly investigated and studied, prehistoric cemeteries and isolated burials are 
	extraordinary sources of scientific information about the lives of native peoples.  Yet 	ancient burials and burial places are often controversial topics today. </p>
	<p>Many American Indians feel a strong ancestral connection to prehistoric cemeteries 
	  and individual graves and consider these to be sacred places that should be left 
	  undisturbed. Yet modern life continues apace and prehistoric (and historic) graves 
	  are often found directly in the path of development and land modification. With the 
	  passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990, 	there are now formal procedures that cover how scientists and descendant groups consult 	with one another and handle human remains  encountered on federal lands, as well as  those that are held by institutions that receive federal funds.  Such 
	  remains are often reburied, sometimes after scientific study and sometimes with little 
	  or no study.  When the graves can be linked to direct descendants and  descendant groups, few would dispute the descendants' rights to speak for their ancestors. But in  areas such as the South Texas Plains, where  so few native groups survived in any form, it is very difficult or impossible to link prehistoric graves to  direct descendants.</p>
	<p><strong> Most archeologists today acknowledge that scientific and Native American 
	  perspectives are both valid and see that respectful compromise is the preferred path to resolving and avoiding conflict.</strong></p>
	<p>Quite a few cemeteries and isolated burials are known from the South Texas Plains 
	and adjacent areas.  Most of these have been discovered accidentally on private land by 	land modification activities (e.g., pond digging, post-holes, plowing, etc.), 
	construction, and erosion. Many such localities are known only from after-the-fact 
	accounts, minimal documentation, and from collections of grave offerings that have been 
	shown to archeologists.  Relatively few cemeteries and isolated burials have been 
	scientifically excavated and properly documented.  Still, some interesting patterns 
	have emerged. </p>

	<p>Most burials and virtually all of the cemeteries in the region occur along the major 	rivers and their tributaries.  This is no coincidence; these riverine and river valley 
	settings have the highest concentrations of natural food resources (plants and animals) 	across the South Texas Plains, and prehistoric groups heavily used and lived in these 
	areas.  Below we briefly characterize the mortuary traditions in two areas of the 
	region – the San Antonio-Guadalupe and the Inland Rio Grande areas. The largest 
	cemetery known in the region,  the Loma Sandia site, is located in between these two 
	areas on a tributary of the Nueces River in the central part of the South Texas Plains 
	(see <a href="../../images/ap8.html" target="_blank">Loma Sandia</a>). Neither isolated burials or cemeteries are known to occur in the 
	poorly watered brush country of deep South Texas south and west of the Nueces River and
	east of the Rio Grande. </p> 

	<p><strong>San Antonio-Guadalupe:</strong> Many of the largest and best documented cemeteries in 
	the region occur within the drainage basins of the San Antonio and lower Guadalupe 
	Rivers.  Four of these localities are featured elsewhere in the exhibit – to learn 
	more, see<a href="../../images/ap9.html" target="_blank"> Buckeye Knoll</a>, <a href="../../images/ap10.html" target="_blank">Olmos Dam</a>, <a href="../../../morhiss/index.html" target="_blank">Morhiss Mound</a>, and <a href="../../images/ap11.html" target="_blank">Silo</a>. Along the lower Guadalupe cemeteries 	were first established during the Early Archaic period around 7,000  years ago 
	(5,000 B.C.). </p>  

	<p>The Morhiss Mound site is a heavily occupied locality situated on a knoll overlooking an 
	abandoned channel of the Guadalupe River near Victoria where over 250 individuals were 
	buried.  Some of the Morhiss graves are now known to  date to the Early Archaic, but most are 
	thought to have been interred during  the Middle and Late Archaic periods, and most are apparently not 
	concentrated in a discrete cemetery area.  See <a href="../../../morhiss/index.html" target="_blank">Morhiss Mound</a>. </p>

	<p>In contrast, less than five miles away the Buckeye Knoll site contains a true 
	cemetery dating to the Early Archaic was recently investigated using modern techniques.  	The analysis and reporting of this extraordinary site has been delayed by controversy over  reburial issues.  Judging from the limited information that 
	has been released, the grave offerings present at Buckeye Knoll include marine shell beads,
 	stone tools, and an unusual array of ground stone artifacts including boat stones and 
	plummets.  The marine shells show a strong connection to the coast and several 
	artifacts are made of high-quality chert that comes from the Edwards Plateau. Some of 
	the ground stone artifacts are made of exotic (non-local) materials that originate 
	hundreds of miles away at least as distant as the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas. These 	materials and certain artifact forms show that the Early Archaic peoples who buried 
	their dead there were participants in an extensive exchange network that stretched far 
	into the Southeastern U.S. See <a href="../../images/ap9.html" target="_blank">Buckeye Knoll</a>. </p>

	<p>Sizable cemeteries containing at least several dozen individuals are known along the 	
	upper and lower San Antonio River that date to the latter part of the Archaic era 
	around 2100 to 2900 years ago (100-900 B.C.).  Examples include the Olmos Dam site at 
	the headwaters of the San Antonio River and the Silo site some 100 miles downstream.  
	Among the grave offerings found at the Olmos Dam site are pendants made from freshwater 	
	mussel shell and marine conch shell, conch danglers, bone beads, red ochre, and 
	possibly dart points and chert cobbles.  The most distinctive aspect of the Olmos site 
	is the placement of multiple sets of deer antler racks over many of the burials.  See 
	  <a href="../../images/ap10.html" target="_blank">Olmos Dam</a>.  At the Silo site the most distinctive offerings were several sets of large 
	unfinished bifaces and pristine corner-tang knives, both made from Edwards Plateau 
	chert.  See <a href="../../images/ap11.html" target="_blank">Silo</a>. </p>
	<p>A recently reported small Late Prehistoric cemetery near the Medina River in southeast Bexar County presents a telling contrast with the Archaic cemeteries mentioned above. The Coleman Cemetery site (41BX568) dates to around A.D. 1300 and contained the remains of several dozen individuals. Two things are striking. First, these individuals were buried with very few grave offerings, in contrast to the pattern seen at Archaic cemeteries. Secondly, analyses of the bones showed that this population had much worse  health and more evidence of  trauma (broken and damaged bones, probably due  to interpersonal violence) than the  people buried in the region's Archaic cemeteries. Their bones show they  suffered from poor nutrition and underwent periods of starvation. </p>
	<p><strong>Inland Rio Grande:</strong> Many burials have come to light along the Rio 
	Grande in the Falcon Reservoir area on both sides of the river and into northeastern Mexico
 	along the Rio Salado.  Most  were uncovered by wave action and discovered when 
	prolonged drought conditions in the 1990s greatly lowered the reservoir level.  These 
	occur as isolated burials and in small cemeteries, only one of which is known to have 
	contained more than 10 individuals.  The isolated burials are typically found within 
	campsites marked by dense accumulations of living debris, while the small cemeteries 
	seem to have been placed in special locations that are not part of occupation zones.  
	Most burials are tightly flexed or “bundled,” a term meaning that the bones were 
	apparently gathered or bound together (perhaps within a woven mat or leather container) 	
	and brought to the burial site from some distant location.  Some burials are covered by 	
	rocks, in some cases forming cairns (visible piles).  A considerable variety of grave 
	offerings occur including projectile points, bifaces, tubular stone pipes, bone and marine 
	shell beads, and marine shell ornaments, but other burials lack preserved offerings of any sort. </p> 

	<p>Most of the Inland Rio Grande burials seem to date to two periods, the late Middle 
	Archaic about 2500-2800 years ago (500-800 B.C.) the Late Prehistoric and about 
	400-1000 years ago (A.D. 1000-1600).  The range of grave offerings found in the Archaic 
	burials is similar to that found at Loma Sandia, including stone tools, tubular stone 
	pipes, and marine shell ornaments.  In contrast, the Late Prehistoric grave offerings have 
	more in common with those known from the Rio Grande Delta area, such as bird bone beads 	
	and drilled canine and human teeth. </p>

	<p>Collectively, the mortuary traditions of the South Texas Plains suggest that native 
	groups  formed well-defined territories that were centered on the major river valleys.  	
	Within these territories they established compact cemeteries that were used over and 
	over again for generations.  Although the best known period is the Late Archaic, it is 
	likely that more Early Archaic and Middle Archaic cemeteries will come to light along 
	the major drainages as modern land modifications take place.   The poorly-watered 
	brush country between the Nueces River and Rio Grande appears to have been a zone where 	
	people visited in search of seasonally abundant resources (such as prickly pear).  But 
	their “home lands” and burial grounds were elsewhere along permanent bodies of water. </p>
