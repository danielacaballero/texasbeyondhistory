<div class="caption">  <em>This Golondrina point from Atascosa County highlights the fact that the size and shape of many projectile points change during their “use life.” In this example, the original point was probably three times as long as what you see. The point snapped during use and the upper two-thirds of it or so broke off, perhaps due to a missed shot. But the hunting accident didn’t end its use life. After the snap, a new tip was fashioned from the broken edge. The resulting “repaired” point that you see every short and slightly asymmetrical, but was perhaps still serviceable weapon tip. (Notice that the tip of the basal ear on the right is also missing.) TARL collections.</em> </div>
