<div class="caption">The Kothmann Ranch Cache of three long, lanceolate bifaces comes from the San Miguel Creek drainage in Frio County, Texas and compares favorably to a broken biface of this style (far right) excavated in 1971 at the base of the deposits at the La Jita site in Uvalde County. Technologically, these bifaces have Paleoindian characteristics including the outline shape, flaking, and stem grinding.  These bifaces have the outline typical of the Angostura point style in Texas, which has been dated at several sites during the 1990s to about 7000 B.C. and is considered by most to fall near the beginning of the Early Archaic period.</div>
