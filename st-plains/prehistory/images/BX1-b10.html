<div class="caption">  Drawings of the burial of a young adult female (16-19 years old) at the Olmos Dam site near the headwaters of the San Antonio River.  The drawing on the left shows how her body was covered with nine white-tail deer antler racks (and attached skull fragments), which were a common grave offering at this cemetery.  The drawing on the right was made after the deer antlers were removed. As can be seen, a variety of marine and freshwater ornaments accompanied the deceased.  From Lukowski 1988, UTSA-CAR.
