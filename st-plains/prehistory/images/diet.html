<h1>Diet and Health</h1>
	<p>The prehistoric cemeteries of the South Texas Plains, such  as <a href="../../images/ap8.html" target="_blank">Loma Sandia</a>,<a href="../../../morhiss/index.html" target="_blank"> Morhiss Mound</a>, <a href="../../images/ap11.html" target="_blank">Silo</a>, and <a href="../../images/ap10.html" target="_blank">Olmos Dam</a>, are remarkable windows that  are providing insight into diet and health of the native peoples of the region.&nbsp; On a global level it is unusual for hunters  and gatherers to use cemeteries and we would like to know why that was the case  on the South Texas Plain and the greater coastal plains of Texas. By exploring the diet and health of  individuals from these places we may obtain clues as to why they made use of  cemeteries.</p>

    <p>Throughout prehistory the hunters and gatherers of the South  Texas Plains returned to favored gathering, hunting, camping and fishing spots  to obtain these resources according to the changing seasons as long as the territory  in which seasonal resources were accessible and not put off limits by other  groups. The basic characteristics of the hunter-gatherer diet on the South  Texas Plains are well known. </p>
    <p>White-tail deer was typically a mainstay element in the hunter-gatherer  diet. Other important game included pronghorn (antelope), bison, as well as smaller  terrestrial creatures spanning the size range from collared peccary, raccoon, opossum, turkey, jackrabbit,  cottontail rabbit, striped skunk, ground squirrel, cotton rat<em>, </em>pocket gopher and snails, among others.  The rivers and streams yielded bowfin,  catfish, freshwater drum, gar, freshwater mussels and a variety of turtles, as  well as frogs, ducks and alligators. On the coast, on the southeastern  periphery of the South Texas Plains, were a wide variety of fish and mollusks,  particularly black and red drum. Animal foods were only half the  hunter-gatherer economy on the South Texas Plains, and probably not the more  reliable half in many seasons.</p>
    <p>Plant foods were essential, life-saving mainstays,  especially the region&rsquo;s two most celebrated annual crops.&nbsp; In the late summer masses of tunas were harvested from the dense inland prickly pear  fields.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, huge pecan  harvests were often possible along the eastern rivers of the region.&nbsp; Other food sources, which must have been at  times as essential and dependable, were mesquite beans and roots and  tubers.&nbsp; Still other plant resources  include acorns, hickory nuts, grass seeds, fruits such as persimmon, berries,  and the tiny fruits of agarito and other shrubs. </p>
    <p>Among many of the region&rsquo;s peoples, especially those whose  home territories lay east of the Nueces River,&nbsp;  when someone died  they were often taken to cemeteries to be buried. Cemetery  sites like Loma Sandia, the Morhiss Mound, Silo Site and the Olmos Dam Site were  special locations for Native Americans, for they returned to them, sometimes  for thousands of years, to bury their kin (see <a href="mortuary.html" target="_blank">Mortuary Traditions</a>.) While it&rsquo;s difficult for  archaeologists to know the special meanings these places must have held, their  skeletal remains offer valuable evidence about their diet and health and  ultimately offer clues as to why some hunters and gatherers on the South Texas  Plain used cemeteries, in contrast to many other peoples elsewhere in the world  whose lifeways depended on wild plants and animals.</p>
    <p>Physical anthropologists study the bones and teeth and can determine  age at death, sex, and general health evidenced by, fractures and other  injuries, diseases that affect the bone, arthritis, dental health and occasionally  the cause of death. One conclusion of these investigations is that generally the  inland groups, such as those buried at Morhiss Mound and Olmos Dam, &nbsp;were generally healthy and had adequate food  supplies most of the time. In contrast people from other cemeteries on the  coast showed more signs of stress and disease, as did the latter peoples buried  at some inland cemeteries such as the Coleman  Cemetery in southwestern Bexar County.</p>
    <p>The expression &ldquo;we are what we eat&rdquo; sums up recent results  of a chemical study of small samples of human bone that tells us more about the  diet. <strong>Dr. Robert Hard</strong> of the University  of Texas at San   Antonio and physical anthropologist <strong>Dr. Anne Katzenberg</strong> of the University of Calgary  applied funding from the National Science Foundation to analyze small pieces of  bone from Texas  cemeteries to measure the levels of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes  preserved in the bone tissue. Since various categories of plants and animals  have different levels of stable carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) isotopes they act like tracers that leave a record in  an organism&rsquo;s tissues as the carbon and nitrogen moves from the environment to  plants and animals and their consumers including people. These tracers allowed  us to identify some of the classes of food the people consumed.</p>
    <p>Our study examined human remains from twelve cemeteries  including Morhiss Mound, Loma Sandia and Olmos Dam cemeteries as well as a  prehistoric cemetery near Corpus Christi known  as Cayo del Oso, located on the shore   of Oso Bay. Unfortunately  the badly deteriorated bone from the Loma Sandia cemetery did not yield usable  results. The remaining three cemeteries represent three different ecological  zones. One is the Coastal Zone that incorporates the shore line, bays,  estuaries, river mouths and marshes within about 50 km of the coast and includes  the Cayo del Oso site. </p>
    <p>Two zones within the South Texas Plain proper were sampled  by our study,&nbsp; the Riverine-Savanna Zone  and the Inland Zone. The Riverine-Savanna Zone extends from the western  boundary of the Coastal Zone westward to an elevation of about 200 ft. &nbsp;Here the land is flat and low and the rivers  have wide floodplains. As sea levels rose thousands of years ago, the floodplains  filled with alluvium, decreased their gradient and the flow of the rivers  slowed, causing them to meander more and form oxbow lakes, swamps and sloughs,  where freshwater resources became abundant particularly in the spring when fish  spawn and some species were trapped in the backwaters by falling floodwaters. &nbsp;Archaeologist <strong>Dr. Grant Hall </strong>referred to this  area as containing &ldquo;natural catfish farms.&rdquo; This zone contains many of the  largest prehistoric hunter-gatherer cemeteries in the state, including Morhiss  Mound. (Refer to the Ancient Places layer on the interactive map on the South  Texas Plain Main page. The medium green region of the map is roughly equivalent  to the Riverine-Savanna Zone.)</p>
    <p>The Inland Zone extends west from the Riverine-Savanna Zone and  north to the edge of Edwards   Plateau. The flat to  hilly land arises from the 200 ft. contour interval to about 1000 ft elevation  in the vicinity of San Antonio.  The upstream reaches of the major rivers tend to be narrow, down-cut (incised),  and less sinuous than the lower stretches and they have numerous tributaries. Fish  and mussels are present in the streams, but not in the density of the lower  reaches of the rivers in the Riverine-Savanna Zone. The Olmos Dam cemetery is  in the Inland Zone.</p>
    <p>Changing levels of 13C and 15N  isotopes in the bone cannot tell us what specific foods were eaten, but when  used together they can indicate what classes of food were consumed. The five classes  relevant to this discussion are: 1) most terrestrial (land-based) plants, 2)  terrestrial animals, 3) cactus such as prickly pear, 4) freshwater resources  including fish and mussels and 5) marine (saltwater) fish and mussels. </p>
    <p>The results of our study at first did not seem surprising. Among  the Inland Zone samples, the levels of 13C and 15N  were low, indicating that the people were largely dependent upon terrestrial  plants and terrestrial animals, with minor levels of freshwater resources and  cactus. In marked contrast are the results from the coastal Cayo del Oso  cemetery. Here the levels of 13C  and 15N were notably  elevated suggesting marine resources were the most important, followed by  terrestrial plants. Terrestrial animals seem to play a surprisingly minor  role in the diet, and cactus does not appear to be significant either. Even more  surprising is the apparent virtual absence of freshwater resources, despite  their presence up the nearby Nueces   River and tributaries.  Apparently, coastal peoples were coastal peoples.</p>
    <p>The individuals from Morhiss Mound had the most diverse diet  of all;  they used four of the resource groups. Their diet was  dominated by freshwater resources, terrestrial animals and terrestrial plants. Marine  resources are indeed present, but there is not much evidence of cactus use.</p>
    <p>At first glance these results seem straight-forward. People in the Inland Zone concentrated on  terrestrial plant and animals resources; people in the Riverine-Savannah Zone  ate a wide variety of resources, particularly freshwater resources, and the  inhabitants of the Coastal Zone ate marine foods. Upon closer consideration,  however, there are several remarkable elements of these findings. The first is  that the Native Americans from Cayo del Oso did not have a more diverse diet.  Their nutrition included marine resources and terrestrial plants. We must ask,  why weren&rsquo;t they using more terrestrial animals, freshwater resources and  cactus? As any fisherman knows, the fishing isn&rsquo;t always good in the same spot and  multiple resources are needed to compensate for the ebb and flow of different  foods through the seasons and years.</p>
    <p>We think the answer lies in the Riverine-Savanna Zone. Here  we find the largest cemeteries, people in generally good health, and the most  diverse and nutritious diet centered on the wide floodplains. One likely  scenario is that the Riverine populations formed territories and tightly controlled  access to their lands, limiting the degree that coastal peoples could move  inland to hunt and fish if resources were in short supply along the coast. A  number of osteological studies of coastal populations along the south Texas coast show that  coastal populations were in poorer health than people either in the Inland or  Riverine Zones. In contrast people in the Inland Zone probably had a much lower  population density, allowing both Inland and Riverine groups to exploit a wider  range of territory to off set seasonal shortfalls. </p>
    <p>The formation of established territories is likely related  to the use of large cemeteries, in that people were constrained to a relatively  limited area and the cemeteries perhaps were a way of symbolizing their control  of an area. Further studies of the Morhiss Mound remains and the publication of  the recently excavated Early Archaic cemetery at the <a href="../../images/ap9.html">Buckeye Knoll</a> site will  allow us to examine how early these territories formed, as well as address many  other questions, from diet and health, to group size, regional and  extraregional interaction spheres, and much more.&nbsp; All in all, the study of prehistoric  cemeteries gives us unequalled knowledge about the native peoples of the South  Texas Plains and adjacent regions such as the Prairies and Marshlands along the  coast. </p>
