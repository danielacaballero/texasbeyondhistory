<div class="caption">The abundance of end scrapers at many Toyah sites shows the importance of hide 
processing.  The replica was made by Jimmy Bluhm using asphaltum adhesive, a method used by some Toyah 
groups with access to coastal resources.  The archeological specimens at the top are from the Hinojosa 
site near Alice, Texas and show some of the range in variation in size and shape among this artifact 
class.  The small “thumb-nail” scrapers are particularly common at some sites, but rather large scrapers
 were favored at others.</div>
