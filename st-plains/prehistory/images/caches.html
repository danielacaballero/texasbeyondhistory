<h1>Biface Caches</h1>
	<p>Biface caching is an intriguing prehistoric pattern on the South Texas Plains. Such caches consist 
	of purposefully hidden (&quot;cached,&quot; usually buried) groups of large, well-made, percussion-shaped, symmetrical bifaces. <strong>Cache 
	bifaces</strong> typically have no evidence of use, resharpening, notching or other evidence of specific 
	function. Most are well suited for being turned into large knives or very large spear and dart 
	points, but they were left in pristine form.  Most commonly found in the South Texas Plains are triangular cache bifaces, but forms can range from 
	ovate to lanceolate in outline.  Such artifacts are sometimes called 
	“trade blanks” or “quarry blanks,” but the biface caching pattern is more than mere trade in 
	tool-making stock.</p>
    <p>The biface caches discussed here are  isolated finds. Such caches are distinct from, at least to some extent, clusters of  bifaces 
(some of which are of cache bifaces) found at some cemetery sites  (see <a href="../../images/ap8.html" target="_blank">Loma Sandia</a> and  <a href="../../images/ap11.html" target="_blank">Silo</a>). 
The bifaces selected to be mortuary items placed with a particular individual are grave offerings.  Other clusters or caches of bifaces found at cemetery sites are not directly 
associated with a grave, but may still represent ritual offerings as well as hidden or stored items 
intended for other purposes.  Most of the biface caches discussed here are those that are not found in cemetery 
contexts.</p>
    <p>Most cache bifaces are made of Edwards Chert and were traded into south Texas from on or near the 
Edwards Plateau in central Texas.  Though large chert cobbles of Uvalde gravels do occur in the South 
Texas Plains, mainly in hilltop exposures, these are not common. (See &quot;Uvalde&quot; gravel entries in the <a href="../../nature/rocks.html" target="_blank"> Rock Gallery</a>.) Most pieces of chert found in Uvalde gravel exposures are unsuitable for the 
manufacture of cache bifaces, especially sets of bifaces made of uniformly good-quality materials.  Along 
the lower Rio Grande, caches with mostly smaller, thinner bifaces have been found that contain 
specimens that appear to have been made from local gravel outcrops.</p> 
    <p>We do not yet know much  about the mechanisms of the biface trade.  A broad study of Texas biface caches by Kevin 
Miller indicates these types of biface caches, made of Edwards Chert, occur in some numbers east of Austin 
and into east Texas.</p>
    <p>Caches of other stone tool forms have also been found in the South Texas Plains, especially those of 
the distinctive Guadalupe adze, which dates to the Early Archaic period. Archeologist Ken Brown has 
reported several of these caches.  The Guadalupe tools found in these caches have use wear and are clearly 
utilitarian artifacts, probably used in wood-working.  They are thought to have been were cached, or 
perhaps “curated” is more appropriate, for later use by their owner.   See <a href="adzes.html" target="_blank">Woodworking Tool Tradition</a> to learn more about 
Guadalupe Tools.</p>
    <p>Most biface caches on the South Texas Plain appear to date from Late to Transitional Archaic in age.  
There are, however, at least two known caches from the South Texas Plains that could well date to late 
Paleoindian times.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Kothmann Ranch Cache</strong> of three long, lanceolate bifaces comes from the San Miguel Creek drainage in 
Frio County, Texas.  According to the late Dr. Pat Riley, whose family owned the ranch at one time, this 
cache was found between 1929-1934.  Unfortunately, no further details are known; Riley kept the cache 
together for several decades, and it was ultimately donated to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory 
(TARL) by his family in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The bifaces range in length from 22 cm (9”) to 29 cm (11.5”), in maximum widths from 3.8-4.8 cm, and 
thickness, around 5-7 mm.  Thus, they are very large, very thin, and exceedingly well flaked.   Two of the 
specimens on which all cortex has been removed are perhaps the most “finished” and have intentional 
dulling (edge grinding) along the lower edges – dulling of the sort that is typical of Paleoindian lithic 
bifaces. There is also scattered dulling along the middle lateral edges of the largest specimen, and this 
may reflect edge preparation during final flaking.   Flaking patterns are primarily parallel to slightly 
parallel oblique.  Note that one specimen has a patch of cortex near its base; we will come back to this 
in some later observations.</p>
<p>The largest specimen is broken in three places, and the smallest has a single break, although its tip 
and a small part of its base are also missing.   The other specimen, of grayish-brown chert, is unbroken; 
it also appears to be the most finished, with lateral edge grinding and a biconvex cross section.   There 
are no plow-strikes on the bifaces.  They may have been found eroded onto the surface and broken 
post-deposition.  On the other hand, it is possible that two of the specimens were intentionally broken.</p>
<p>Overall, the Kothmann Ranch bifaces have the outline typical of point styles called Angostura in Texas, 
and which have been dated during the 1990s to about 7000 B.C.     Supporting this antiquity is a broken 
biface of this style excavated in 1971  at the base of the deposits at the La Jita site in Uvalde County.</p>
<p>In 1998, David Calame was able to obtain information about  a cache of two elongated bifaces from far 
northern Frio County. Like the Kothmann Cache, it was also found along the San Miguel drainage. These 
specimens, known as the <strong>Knothole Cache,</strong> were found about 1973 by workmen digging a garbage pit; they 
brought them to the attention of the ranch owner, who did further excavation at the find spot, but 
found no additional specimens.  Calame photographed and documented the bifaces, although these were 
glued down to a display board.  </p>
<p>The largest specimen is very similar in outline to the Kothmann Cache.   
  It is 33.5 cm long (over 13 inches), 5.5 mm wide, and 5-7 mm thick.  There is cortex at the base, as on 
  one Kothmann specimen.  Prepared platforms can be seen along the lateral edges and there is some 
  edge-dulling that appears to be related to the reduction process.  The flaking is carefully done, mostly 
  parallel, with deep parallel flakes near the base.  The second specimen is 27.5 cm long (11 inches), 
  5.3 cm wide, and about 6.5 mm in average thickness.  It has cortex at the base, where is it straight or 
  flat.  The distal portion has short parallel to parallel oblique flakes, and broad percussion flakes on 
  the lower half.  Interestingly, parts of the edges of both bifaces are lightly serrated.</p>
<p>The Kothmann Ranch and Knothole Caches are remarkably similar, and the similarity is shared by the 
lanceolate biface from the base of the La Jita site in Uvalde County, roughly 50-60 miles to the northwest.
It is possible that these caches represent the Angostura equivalent (i.e., terminal Late Paleoindian or 
Early Archaic in age) of the Clovis caches of earlier times, a well known phenomena.   While no Clovis 
caches with large unfinished Clovis bifaces, have yet been found in south Texas, they are well known from 
the western United States (East Wenatchee in Washington State, Simon in Idaho, Drake in Colorado) as well 
as other areas of Texas. Clovis caches, sometimes quite large, are also known of blades and blade cores, 
suggesting that stone tool caching was a characteristic pattern of the times.</p> 
<p>Most of the other biface caches known from the South Texas Plains appear to date to the latter part of 
the Archaic era.  The <strong>Riley Cache</strong>, was discovered in 1929 in southwestern Medina County and consists of 29 
medium-sized bifaces.  Kevin Miller has reported the details of this cache. How the cache was found is a 
story all by itself.</p> 
<p> A young boy and his dog were hunting rabbits along a creek that drains into the Atascosa Creek 
southwest of the town of Lytle.  They chased a rabbit into its burrow, and the boy began digging at the 
hole, trying to get the animal.   It isn’t known if the rabbit was found or escaped, but the boy did 
uncover  29 bifaces that were buried in white creek-bed sand, apparently this sand had used as special 
fill in the presumed cache pit. The boy took his surprising find to a grocery store owner in Lytle to 
trade the artifacts for groceries. They were later acquired from the store owner by an uncle of Dr. Pat 
Riley, who kept the specimens together for almost 50 years. Like the Kothmann Ranch cache, the Riley Cache 
is curated at TARL, where it can be  studied by researchers. </p>
<p>The Knothole specimens are quite uniform in technology, shape and size.  The cherts of which they are 
made vary somewhat in color (different shades of  brown, including chocolate brown, and light to dark 
gray).  By examining the UV fluorescence of the bifaces, Michael Collins found that all are were of 
the distinctive yellowish orange color thought to be typical of Edwards chert.</p>   
<p>Biface shapes within the Knothole Cache can be characterized as “sub-triangular,” with some specimens 
distinctly triangular and others ovate in outline. Miller describes the Riley Cache bifaces as “blanks” 
typical of many of the caches that he has examined.  However, he thinks one specimen  has evidence of use, 
perhaps as a cutting tool.   Miller believes that all had been made by soft-hammer percussion, with some 
of the specimens originally made on large flakes and others reduced from chert nodules.   The mean length 
of the 29 specimens is 100.8 mm, mean width, 69.1, and mean thickness, 10.2 mm. In aggregate, they weigh 
5.7 pounds. </p>
<p>Bifaces quite similar to those from the Riley Cache were found among a cache of eight bifaces found on 
the Mexican side of Falcon Lake during the 1990s, when the water level in the lake was 30-40 feet low. As 
reported by Chandler and Kumpe, the <strong>Falcon-Tamaulipas Cache</strong> consisted of stacked bifaces, the two largest 
of which were said to have been carefully placed in a crisscross pattern at the top of the stack.  The 
upper three were visible on the surface, and the discoverer found the others tightly stacked beneath them. 
Ultra-violet fluorescence of the cache revealed that 7 of the 8 were of Edwards chert,   the source of 
the eighth is unknown.   Six of the bifaces, all of Edwards chert, were typified by white speckled 
inclusions, identified as Cretaceous-age fossil shells.</p>
<p>Chandler and Kumpe also described the <strong>Roma Cache</strong>, a cluster of four thin triangular bifaces found by 
Kumpe in 1967 near the town of Roma in Starr County.  Rains from a hurricane had exposed  the walls of a 
narrow wash, and  exposed the bifaces, which appeared to have been cached under a rectangular sandstone 
slab. Kumpe believes that other bifaces were probably present, buried deep in the wall of the gully. These 
bifaces are basically triangular in shape.  Interestingly, two otherwise complete bifaces were each found 
in two pieces; they appear to have been intentionally broken by diagonal breaks near mid-section. The two 
other specimens were fragmentary, one was a distal section and the other had a broken corner.   None of 
the Roma Cache artifacts was made of Edwards chert. Chandler and Kumpe describe these as “olive-gray 
grainy cherts”, a reddish conglomerate, and “white chert,” which suggests that they are from local sources, 
probably the Rio Grande gravels.</p>
<p>While the Falcon-Tamaulipas Cache is typical of south Texas biface caches, there may be additional 
behavior seen in the Roma Cache.  The bifaces in this cache may well have been “killed” –intentionally 
broken for ritual purposes—before they were deposited.</p>
<p>The <strong>Falcon-Scott Cache</strong> is an unusually large set of bifaces from Falcon Lake, this time in Zapata 
County. This cache, documented by James Boyd, consists of 48-52 bifaces found with a burial at site 41ZP7. 
The count is indefinite because the cache was found by collectors and was not kept together; not all were 
formally documented.  Although this cache is a grave offering, it is by far the largest group of cache 
bifaces found in any context in the region. All of the specimens are  made of Rio Grande gravels (see <a href="../../nature/rocks.html" target="_blank">Rock Gallery</a>), except for a stemmed biface which fluoresces 
as Edwards chert.  This atypical specimen is of great importance, because the style is fairly common in central 
Texas and dates to the Late Archaic.  Although not formally “typed,” these bifaces are often referred to 
as ”San Saba Knives,” based on studies of similar specimens from San Saba County, published in 1972 by 
Hester and the late avocational archaeologist L. M. Green of Richland Springs.</p> 
<h1>Why Caches?</h1>
<p>How can we explain the caches of large bifaces that have been reported in various parts of the South Texas Plains?  This distinctive pattern spans 
thousands of years. Across the region, the age of documented biface caches and mortuary offerings 
involving large bifaces ranges from the Middle Archaic (Loma Sandia) into the Transitional Archaic (Silo).
There are a smaller number of much earlier biface caches that seem to date to the onset of the Early 
Archaic, or perhaps even as early as Late Paleoindian times. </p> 
<p>Kevin Miller suggests that caches could have been raw material stockpiles or “insurance” for further 
needs, as well as sources of material for ritual or status demands. Perhaps the isolated caches that have 
been found are examples of stock piles that, for reasons unknown, were never returned to by the “owner.”  
In this scenario, most cache bifaces would have been subsequently distributed, through trade, to other 
peoples on the South Texas Plains, either to be finished and used as knives, or left as “blanks” and used 
as mortuary offerings.  As Chris Lintz and Bryant Saner, Jr. have stated, “archaeologically recovered 
caches present static snap-shots of a dynamic prehistoric process of assembling, using, and dispersing a 
mass of goods that are regarded as useful.”</p>
<p>Lintz and Saner suggest that cache bifaces may well have been used in many different ways.  This 
include the use of cache bifaces as cores or preforms, as mortuary offerings, in other types of rituals, 
to symbolize status, and for utilitarian uses, some quite specific.  An example of the latter is a large, 
thin biface from the Shrew site in Wilson County that was found to have extensive use wear related to the 
cutting of grasses and plants. Another very large cache biface found as a single occurrence in Starr 
County near Falcon Lake may represent an item that was “pulled” from a cache to be used in some specific 
way.</p>
<p>While archeological clues are often lacking as to exactly how cache bifaces were used, there is one 
extraordinary set of first-hand ethnographic observations, that of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca in the 
mid-1530s. While among the Avavares peoples of south Texas, Cabeza de Vaca learned of a mythical incident 
involving Mala Cosa (“the Bad Thing”), a strange little man who used a big flint knife up to two palms 
long and a hand wide to cut the Avavares (sometimes removing their intestines, but then healing the wound).
Large flint bifaces were given by the Cutalcuches as gifts to Cabeza de Vaca. He noted that this group 
used such artifacts which he described as being  up to a palm and a half long. These were prized belongings, yet were also used for 
cutting tasks.  Cabeza de Vaca made these intriguing references to large bifaces while describing time spent with Avavares and the Cutalcuches, who shared  a prickly pear harvesting area  in Duval or Jim 
Hogg County in summer of 1535 .</p>
<p>What is the length of a biface calculated at l ½  or 2 palms?   Sixteenth century
Spanish measurements are inconsistent.  A <em>palmo </em>is thought to have been about 20 cm (8 inches). This, however, 
 is the <em>palmo mayor</em>, while a <em>palmo menor</em> was about 7 cm.  We don’t know what measurement value Cabeza 
de Vaca attached to his palmo, but certainly there are cache and mortuary bifaces in south Texas that are 
at least a “palm” or more in length.</p>
<p>When referring to the “trade” or “exchange” of lithic bifaces, we are assuming that it was this type of 
mechanism that brought many of the cache bifaces from the Plateau and Canyonlands of central Texas to the 
South Texas Plains.  Miller has mapped the distribution of biface caches emanating from the Edwards 
Plateau, and extending into south Texas, as well as far into east Texas. It has been established that most 
of the  raw material in these caches is from the Edwards Plateau.   Certainly, the peoples of south Texas, 
who normally made use of the typically hard, flawed, and small materials found in the  Uvalde and Rio 
Grande gravels, would have wanted to acquire bifaces of high quality chert.   But what could they have 
offered in exchange? </p>  
<p>North of the Balcones Escarpment along the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau, there are very few (if any) 
documented stone artifacts, or artifacts of any other non-perishable material, that appear to be items 
that originated in “trade” from southern Texas.  Therefore, we have to assume that if such exchanges were 
made in acquiring these bifaces, the goods were of a perishable nature.  Again the most telling evidence 
comes from Cabeza de Vaca. </p>
<p>Krieger’s account of Cabeza de Vaca’s interactions with south Texas Indian groups indicate that 
foodstuffs were commonly exchanged (e.g., prickly pear fruits, mesquite bean flour; meat), and 
that the Spaniard traded with the Indians by making them combs, bows and arrows, mats, and nets.  During 
his years among coastal Texas groups, de Vaca served as a trader.  He took “shells of sea snails and their
 cores,&quot; conches (“with which they cut...”), a fruit or bean (still unknown) that was both for cures and 
 for dances and celebrations, and “sea beads.”  The fruits or beans were the items of greatest value. 
 These were exchanged with interior groups for hides, red ochre, flint for arrow points, glue, canes for 
 arrow shafts, and tassels of deer hair that had been dyed red.   This account serves as an example of an 
 active trade network between the coast and the interior of the South Texas Plains.  The larger trade 
 network between the Edwards Plateau and the South Texas Plains may well have involved chert of high 
 quality from the Edwards Plateau (in large biface form).  Whether the Edwards Plateau peoples would have 
 been interested in hides, ochre, cane, and deer-hair tassels is hard to say, but there may have been some 
 commodities among these (and other perishables) that were valued by them. See <a href="distant.html" target="_blank">Distant Connections</a>. </p>
