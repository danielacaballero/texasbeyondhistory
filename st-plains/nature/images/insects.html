<h1>Insects</h1>
		<p>Crawling and flying insects are a reliable source of protein and even a delicacy among many 
		different cultures of the world. Although there is scant archeological evidence of this part 
		of the native diet in south Texas, there are several accounts by explorers commenting on the 
		consumption of grubs and bugs. The Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca, who lived among several 
		native groups in south Texas in the early 1500s, wrote in his account (La Relación) that although 
		they killed deer and fish, “their hunger is so great that they eat spiders and ant eggs and 
		worms…and the dung of deer, and I believe truthfully that if in that land there were rocks, 
		they would eat them.”</p>
		<p>By some accounts,  coastal groups placed meat and fish  out in the open to attract flies and larvae, which were eaten along with the flesh. Other insects, 
		  such as grasshoppers and crickets likely were eaten, based on evidence from ancient coprolites
		   (preserved human feces) from dry caves in the adjacent Lower Pecos canyons. </p>
