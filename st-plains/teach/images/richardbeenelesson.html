<p class="text"> <strong>Lesson Title: </strong><br>
   Stratigraphy – Layers of Time in the Earth
</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Subjects:</strong> Science, Social Studies </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level: </strong> 11-12</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Rationale:</strong> This lesson introduces students to the concept of 
	  stratification as a historical and geological process.</p>

      <p class="text"><strong> Lesson Duration: </strong> 45 minutes</p>
     <p class="text"><strong> Objectives: </strong></p>
	 <p class="text">Students will read about the Richard Beene archeological site, which lies near San Antonio, Texas on the Medina River, and watch a short video about stratification. They will then color code the different strata present at the site and answer questions from the reading. </p>

      <p class="text"><strong> Activity </strong></p>
      		<p class="text"> Step 1: Ask Students how we gain information about peoples and cultures from 
	  		thousands of years ago. Explain that archeologists dig in the earth for artifacts, (objects made or 
	  used by man) that help us understand how people of long ago lived.</p>
     		<p class="text"> Step 2: Distribute pages 1 & 2 of the activity, <em>Stratigraphy – Layers of Time in the 
	 		Earth</em>. Read the text of page 1 aloud with students. Ask students for examples of artifacts they 
	 		sometimes see on the ground and that future archeologists may find (for example, gum wrappers, 
	 marbles, buttons, etc.)</p>
<p class="text"> Step 3: Explain that students will view an action video illustrating the stratification process. Before viewing the video, display the following questions (omitting answers) on the board or overhead and read them aloud with students:
<ul>
<li class="text">What Texas river is depicted in the video? (answer: Medina River)</li>
<li class="text">What stratification time span was depicted in the video? (answer: 15,000 years)</li>
<li class="text">Describe the cause and effect process depicted in the video which created the strata. (answer: Cause – continual flooding of the Medina River: Effect – layers of silt and gravel left by the flooding built up strata)</li>
<li class="text">List at least 3 examples of human interaction at the site. (possible answers: prehistoric peoples hunting and camping on the Medina River; Spanish explorers and missionaries moving through the area; Spanish ranchers settling in the area; cotton farmers and their slaves cultivating the area)</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">Have students go to the Texas Beyond History Digging Through Layers of Time  website at <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/beene/digging/index.php">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/beene/digging/index.php</a>and click on the See Stratification in Action activity. As they view the video, have them write down the answers to the above questions. After viewing the activity, call for volunteers to read their answers to the questions and discuss.
</p>
	       <p class="text"> Step 4: Distribute the stratigraphy diagram handout and colored pencils. Have students complete the worksheet.</p>
	      <p class="text">Step 5: Have students write their answers to the four questions on the diagram handout.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong>Modification for Special Learning Needs:</strong> Have students color only 
	  the sky and trees, and color code only the wide bands on the diagram. The four questions on the 
  handout may be answered aloud.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Student Product:</strong> Completed color-coded stratigraphy diagram
	   <li>Answers to the four handout questions</li>
	   <li>Answers to the video questions</li></p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Closure:  </strong>Ask students what one artifact from their lives they 
	  would NOT want found by future archeologists and have them explain their answers.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Assessment: </strong> Ask students why the deepest layer in an archeological site is usually the oldest. </p>
     
      <p class="text"><strong> Extension Activity: </strong>Have students read aloud and explain their answers to question #4  (Why do you think people camped at this site over and over again during different time periods?) on the diagram handout.</p>
