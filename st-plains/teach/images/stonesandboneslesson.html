<p class="text"> <strong>Lesson Title: </strong><br>
   Stones, Bones & Telephones: Analyzing Artifacts 
Using Bloom’s Taxonomy
</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Subjects:</strong>Texas, American, or World History</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level: </strong> TEKs are provided for 7th grade but can easily be adapted to 8th, 10th, or 11th grades.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Rationale:</strong> A thorough discussion of any given artifact can 
	  easily be based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, a teaching tool that can take students through the hierarchy
	   of thinking levels, from simple and concrete to complex and abstract. Analyzing artifacts using 
	   Bloom's Taxonomy allows students on all levels (from remedial to gifted and talented) to exercise
	    the complete range of critical thinking skills.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Materials: </strong></p>
      <ul>
	  <li class="text">Collection of artifacts, including a cell phone, and a few items which are not artifacts, such as a carrot, a pine cone, etc.</li>
        <li class="text">6-8 small paper bags, each containing a different artifact.</il>

      <p class="text"><strong> Activity - Day 1 </strong></p>
      <p class="text"> Step 1: Write the word <strong>artifact</strong> on the board or overhead and ask for a student 
	  volunteer to define it. Lead students to the following definition: <strong>anything made or altered by man</strong>. 
	  Ask students if a stone or a bone could be considered an artifact. (Answer: Yes, if they are used 
	  as tools).</p>
     <p class="text"> Step 2: Show a cell phone to the class and ask them if it is an artifact.
     Explain that many questions can be asked about artifacts, some simple and some very complex.</p>
	       <p class="text"> Step 3: Have the students get into small groups. Distribute one copy of 
		   the student handout, <em>Stones, Bones, And Telephones: Analyzing Artifacts Using Bloom’s Taxonomy</em>		   
		   to each group and place an overhead transparency of the handout on the overhead.</p>
	       <p class="text"> Step 4: Ask three students to volunteer to illustrate different levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy. 
		   Ask one student what his name is. Ask the other student whether he would rather ride the school bus home or 
		   ride home with his best friend. Ask students which question was simple and which was complex and have them explain their answers.</p>
	       <p class="text"> Step 5: On the student handout transparency, go over the six Thinking Levels and corresponding Cue Words with students.</p>
	       <p class="text"> Step 6: Ask students to volunteer answers for the <strong>Knowledge</strong> category on the handout, using the cell phone as their artifact. 
		   Write correct answers on the handout transparency.</p>
	       <p class="text"> Step 7: Direct students to work in their groups to fill in the rest of the handout.</p>
	       <p class="text"> Step 8: Relate that in 1956, a man named Benjamin Bloom devised a way to measure the steps 
		   by which we learn. The steps begin with simple learning and move to complex learning. This measurement of 
		   learning activity is known as Bloom’s Taxonomy. Ask students why we might want to use different levels of
		    thinking in our lives.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong>Modification for Special Learning Needs:</strong> Instead of having students
	   work independently in groups, call on individuals to fill in answers to the Student Handout.
  Fill in the transparency of the Student Handout as correct answers are given.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Student Product:</strong> Correctly completed Student Handouts.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Closure:  </strong>  Write the word <strong>metacognition</strong> on the board or overhead 
	  projector. Explain that the word means thinking about our own thought processes and add that we 
	  engage in metacognitive activities everyday. Activities such as analyzing an artifact or planning
	   how to study for a test are examples of metacognition. Ask students to name more examples.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Assessment: </strong>Correct completion of Student Handouts.</p>
     
      <p class="text"><strong> Extension Activity: </strong>
	  <p class="text"><strong> Activity - Day 2 </strong></p>
     <p class="text"> Step 1: Remind students of yesterday’s artifact analysis. Ask for a volunteer 
	 to define the word <strong>artifact</strong>. Ask another student to define <strong>metacognition</strong>. Explain that today 
	 student’s will view an artifact online and work in groups to analyze it using the same graphic 
	 organizer used yesterday.</p>
	      <p class="text"> Step 2: Distribute Student Handouts of the mystery artifact and the Artifact Analysis sheet.
		   Have students work in groups to analyze the unknown artifact.</p>
	      <p class="text"> Step 3: When all groups have completed analysis of the mystery artifact, place a 
		  transparency of the Student Handout on the overhead. Ask a representative from each group to volunteer
		   how his group completed one section of the handout. Continue with different students until the 
		   transparency is completed.</p>
	      <p class="text"> Step 4: After all groups have reported their analyses, show the Artifact Drawing.
Explain that the artifact they analyzed is a pipe from the Loma Sandia Archeological Site, a prehistoric cemetery and campsite in Live Oak County Texas (850-550 BC).  Such pipes were smoked by adult males, probably during important rituals, and were placed next to the bodies in some of the graves.
