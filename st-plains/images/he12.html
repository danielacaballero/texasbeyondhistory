<h1>Tortuga Flat</h1>
<p>The Tortuga Flat site (41ZV155)  is significant as one of the few reported Late Prehistoric/Early Historic 
campsites that reveals traditional lifeways of the region’s indigenous peoples on the “eve” of the Spanish 
<em>entrada</em>.  Radiocarbon assays  indicate the Zavala County site was used in the 15th and 16th centuries. </p>
<p>Spanish accounts tell us this area was frequented during the 1700s by the Pacuache Indians and other 
hunting and gathering groups who spoke the Coahuilteco language. The 1709 diary of the Spanish priest, Felix Isidro de Espinosa, who traveled from Mission San Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande to San Antonio and beyond (Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition), tells of 
encounters with the “Pacuasian” (likely Pacahuache) peoples who were hunting mice (in either present-day 
Dimmit or Zavala county). Spanish records from the missions at Guerrero, Mexico, tell us that these peoples, 
numbering perhaps 400 in all during the early to mid-18th century, moved from camp to camp, sheltering 
themselves in lean-tos of branches covered with grasses. Another account records a group of Pacahuache hunting bison near the area of 
present day Del Rio.    Pacuache women often decorated the hides with red and yellow painted designs to trade to the Spaniards and others at the missions.</p> 
<p>Evidence from the Tortuga Flat site supports these observations. During 1972-1973, 
avocational archeologist T. C. Hill of Crystal City conducted test excavations at the site, uncovering what he described as a 
compact zone of cultural materials. Artifacts included a variety of chipped stone tools including Perdiz 
and Scallorn arrow points, bone-tempered ceramics, and animal bones. One Cuney arrow point 
hints at very late contact, perhaps trade, with East Texas native groups.  Although cultural chronologies for the Edwards 
Plateau region indicate that Scallorn and Perdiz points were used in successive time periods (termed the 
Austin and Toyah intervals, respectively), such a demarcation is not apparent in some south Texas sites. 
Tortuga Flat and other sites (eg., Pampopa-Talon Crossing in Medina County and Skillett Mountain in 
McMullen County) suggest use of the two point types may have overlapped. Perhaps the most striking example of late occurence is a fragment of a Perdiz arrow point chipped from glass found at Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo). </p>

<div class="caption"> Most raw material used for tools was locally obtained and often heated to improve the flaking properties of the chert. The bifaces shown here, some of which are likely preforms for arrow points, show a distinctive rosy coloration  caused by heat alteration. TARL collections. <br>

<p>Both tool manufacturing and resharpening took place at the Tortuga Flat site, based on the finding of cores, 
hammerstones, and trimming flakes.  Cores were worked efficiently to make the most use of the small local 
chert cobbles.  One core appeared to have been reduced using blade-core technology typical of late-period 
Toyah folk; the technique was also used by some Indian groups in  mission settings, including those at Guerrero.  A knife segment, resharpened by alternate beveling, was made on a distinctive fine-grained, 
dark gray material resembling Georgetown chert. Ultra-violet scanning of this artifact and a unifacial 
tool suggests the material for both was Edwards chert from central Texas.</p>  
<p>The presence of beveled knives and end scrapers in sites dating after A.D. 1300 shows the 
importance of bison processing in a widespread exchange network on the southern Plains and adjacent areas. 
The knives were used to cut the hides during skinning and the end scrapers  used to remove hair 
and further dress the hides.</p> 
<p>From this array of evidence we can imagine a busy encampment along the banks of Tortuga Creek and nearby 
environs, where hunters procured deer, antelope, and other large mammals, as well as coyote, rabbit, fox, racoon, rats, and mice, and a variety of birds.Women and children gathered land snails from brushy prairies and aquatic resources from the creek, including freshwater mussels, fish, and turtles. They no doubt also 
gathered a variety of plant foods, which they processed with choppers and  grinding  tools. Based on a 
variety of chipped stone scraping and cutting tools, the women  processed animal hides at the site. They also fashioned 
thin, coiled pottery, probably using local clay from nearby sources tempered with crushed animal bone, 
some of which was first burned.  Hunters also collected local chert and knapped stone tools  and resharpened 
their weapons at the site.</p>
<p>Researchers, including UT-Austin ethnohistorian Dr. T.N. Campbell, believe that at least some of the evidence from the Tortuga Flat site can be attributed to the Pacuache Indians. Spanish records  show that Pacuache families also lived at the Gateway missions at Guerrero. Attempting to discern  correlations between the two occupations, archeologist Betty Inman compared the toolkits from both sites. She found that, while specific artifacts could not be directly associated with the Pacuache,  certain Late Prehistoric and prehistoric tools were not continued into the mission setting. Perhaps this was due to changing technology (introduction of Spanish metal tools) or because of cultural standardization of the natives crowded in Indian housing at the missions.</p>
