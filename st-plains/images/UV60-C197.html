<div class="caption"> Close-up view of an excavation wall showing two dark-stained occupation zones separated by a light-colored band of silty sediment perhaps representing a hiatus or period of time during which the site was unoccupied.  The occupation zones are dark because of organic staining such as that caused by charcoal from cooking fires.  Periodic flood events continued to wash over the site and add layers of silt, most of which are no longer visible because they were simply mixed into the soil by natural and cultural factors such as plant growth and camping. Fire-cracked cooking stone fragments and various other artifacts can be seen within the occupation zones. TARL archives.
