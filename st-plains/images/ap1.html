<h1>Laredo Rio Grande</h1>
<p>Recent excavations at three prehistoric sites south of Laredo near the Rio Grande provide a good look 
at the archeological record of the area and of the considerable challenges facing archeologists.The <strong>Lino site</strong>, the <strong>Boiler site</strong>, and the <strong>Becerra Creek</strong> site are 
all three open campsites set on relatively high terrain not far west of the Rio Grande.  The Lino site is 
less than a mile from the river and is within the low valley of a small, intermittent creek that drains 
the surrounding uplands. The Becerra and Boiler sites are near one another about five miles from the 
river.  Becerra occupies a gently sloping terrain leading from another wet-weather creek to the 
nearby uplands.  Boiler is on a low hilltop upon the uplands proper.  All three sites have Middle/Late 
Archaic components, the Lino site dating primarily to that period. The other two sites also 
have components dating  the Late Prehistoric and  Proto-Historic periods as well. 
<p>The Lino site (41WB437) and the Boiler site (41WB557) were investigated by TRC Mariah, an Austin-based 
environmental and archeological consulting firm; J. Michael Quigg was the lead archeologist at both 
sites.  The work at the Becerra Creek site (41WB556) was carried out by the Center for Archaeological 
Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio; the lead archeologist was Richard B. Mahoney. 
The research at all three sites was undertaken as a result of highway expansion projects carried out the 
Texas Department of Transportation, who sponsored the investigations to satisfy federal and state laws. 
<p>All three sites had buried deposits with seemingly intact cultural features primarily 
consisting of clusters of burned sandstone rocks thought to represent cooking features.  All three sites 
yielded stone tools and tool-making debris.  Organic preservation of prehistoric-aged material was poor 
at these sites and consists of  small quantities of charcoal, land snails, and a few mussel shell fragments. Some
 animal bones were recovered from Boiler and Becerra, but most appeared to be relatively recent in age.  
 Of the three sites, only the Lino site was found to have reasonably well stratified deposits. It was
  found to have five or six occupation zones,  each yielding relatively few stone tools.  The 
  other two sites lacked reasonably discrete occupation zones, although older materials were generally 
  found deeper than younger materials.
<p>Overall, the Laredo Rio Grande sites are characterized by poor organic preservation, evidence of stratigraphic mixing (particularly of 
smaller materials), and the lack of clear-cut changes in stone tool forms through time.  Unstemmed triangular 
projectile points (especially of the Tortugas and Refugio styles) were the most common “diagnostic” artifact forms found at all three sites. The investigators also found dart points classifiable as Tortugas and Matamoros together.  
Collectively, these sites are primary examples of the prevalence of the unstemmed point tradition in the South Texas 
Plains and of the difficulty in meaningfully sorting out types in time. See <a href="../prehistory/images/unstemmed.html" target="_blank">Unstemmed 
Point Tradition</a> and and <a href="../prehistory/images/recycling.html" target="_blank">Stone Tool Recycling</a>.
<p>During the analysis phase of each of the investigations, the researchers struggled with the difficulty 
of dating the deposits and of extracting good subsistence information—the foods consumed at these 
sites.  Lacking much animal bone or charred plant remains, the researchers turned to the one type of 
artifact associated with food-preparation that was present in considerable numbers at all three sites: 
“burned” or “fire-cracked” pieces of sandstone.  Cooked-stone technology was widely used throughout
 most of North America and has been well documented in many regions of Texas.  
<p>As mentioned, the sites all had intact clusters of burned sandstone that clearly represented cooking 
features of various sorts, including hearths, a few small earth/rock ovens, and simple dumps thought to represent 
stone-boiling discard piles.  The locally available cook-stone material is sandstone, a relatively porous sedimentary rock composed of compacted 
sand held together by silica. (See  the <a href="../nature/rocks.html" target="_blank">Rock Gallery</a> in the Nature's Harvest exhibit.) Upon heating, sandstone rocks often become discolored by carbon-staining. 
 They also absorb visually undetectable organic residues from both the firewood and from the food 
 materials they were used to cook. Knowing or suspecting this, Mike Quigg and his colleagues pioneered 
 the application of three new analytical techniques to the analysis of organic compounds extracted from 
 burned pieces of sandstone from intact features.  
<p><strong>Lipid Residue</strong> analysis involves extracting the microscopic organic compounds called lipids (insoluble 
fats, oils, and wax compounds) and identifying the fatty acid component by comparison to modern samples 
from different kinds of plants and animals.   Most of the plants and animals can only be identified by 
class, such as large herbivores and deer/antelope. The site  setting, however, limits the possibilities. In the 
South Texas Plains,  the only large herbivore present in Archaic and Late Prehistoric times was the bison.
<p> <strong>Stable Isotope</strong> analysis involves 
  identifying the isotopic forms of carbon and nitrogen present in bones or, in this case, organic residues 
  extracted from pieces of sandstone.  This approach helps pin down the plant remains as different groups of
  plants follow different photosynthetic pathways.  
<p>The final approach, <strong>Residue Dating</strong>, involves extracting 
  organic residues trapped in burned rocks for  radiocarbon dating using the AMS method. The prospect of 
  being able to directly date the rocks making up a cooking feature is exciting, because charred plant 
  remains (such as charcoal or charred seeds) are often poorly preserved at many sites in the South Texas 
  Plains.
<p>All three of these analytic approaches are complex. As applied to  
organic residues extracted from burned rocks, the techniques are  not yet well developed.  Some archeologists are very skeptical that consistent 
results can be obtained from these methods, yet, almost all scientific techniques are developed in the 
face of skepticism.   Collectively, the results from the application of these methods at the three Laredo 
Rio Grande sites show both the promise and the challenge.  It is not possible to do justice to the 
complex results in a brief categorization.  Learn more by reading Quigg’s 2003 article, linked 
below. 
<p>In summary, the prehistoric records of three Laredo Rio Grande sites, Lino, Becerra Creek, and Boiler, 
appear to have been created by  small groups of native peoples following traditional hunting and gathering
 methods.  The “sites” can perhaps be better thought of as geographically defined segments of the 
 prehistoric landscape, rather than discrete campsites.  Prehistoric peoples frequented the higher 
 terrain on the east side of the Rio Grande following game and available plant resources.   The 
 archeological  investigations of all three sites demonstrate the challenges involved in developing more
  specific understandings of prehistoric life in the region.
