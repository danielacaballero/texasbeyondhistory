  <div align="left">Painting of the Alamo (Mission San Antonio de Valero) by Castroville artist Theodore Gentilz, showing view of the unfinished church, ca. 1840s, following the siege of the Alamo. The church was used as part of the defensive fortifications during the battle.<br><br>
    Gentilz painted all five of the San Antonio missions during the 1840s, providing our earliest glimpses of the imposing structures. Although most had already begun to fall into ruin, he documented many architectural and artistic details before they were destroyed. </div>
