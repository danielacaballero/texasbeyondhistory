		<caption>Bare branches of pecan, hackberry, and willow trees in early spring form a stark framework along the banks of Cibolo Creek in northern Karnes County. The clear creek flows southeast from its headwaters on the Edwards Plateau and across the upper South Texas Plains where it joins the San Antonio River. Such permanent bodies of water provide rich bottomland habitats and diverse natural resources. These bountiful strips were frequented by native peoples throughout prehistory.

		<caption>Grassy pasture lands, here dotted with enormous live oaks, hark back to Spanish Colonial times, when mission ranchos in south Texas supported thousands of head of cattle. Although the dominate grasses today are non-native species cultivated for hay, much of the South Texas Plains was originally a savanna with thick stands of native grasses punctuated by oak mottes.

For native peoples, winter was a lean season when cactus pads, roots, and other marginal food sources sustained life. Photo by Susan Dial. </caption>

The bluff is composed of layer after layer of fine sediment left behind during major flood episodes. The river was one of the few permanent sources of water in this area and a source for aquatic resources (such as fish, turtles, and clams) and rocks for cooking and tool-making.

		<caption>Spiked yucca and other thorny brush are typical of much of the South Texas Plains. In some areas, such southern Bee County where this photo was taken, historic records suggest that the overgrazing of cattle, horses, and other livestock resulted in severe erosion and the destruction of native grasses. Casual visitors to the region may not realize how much the landscape has been transformed over the last 200 years. Photo by Susan Dial.</caption>
