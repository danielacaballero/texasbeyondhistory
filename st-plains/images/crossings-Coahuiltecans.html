<div class="caption"> <em>A encampment of Coahuiltecan Indians as depicted by artist Frank Weir. Spanish travelers noted dozens of native groups camped along streams and crossings near San Antonio during early Historic times. Although many groups spoke different languages and were ethnically distinct, they practiced similar hunting and gathering lifeways. Collectively, we refer to these peoples as Coahuiltecan, as a geographic rather than ethnic descriptor.</em> </div>
