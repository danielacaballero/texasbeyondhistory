<div class="caption"> These two deer antler billets are flintknapping tools used for soft-hammer percussion—they are worn from use and would have been important elements in a flintknapper’s tool kit. Both were found within the  cemetery, associated with disturbed burials. They were clearly  grave offerings, but could not be linked to a specific burial. Similar artifacts have been found as offerings at other prehistoric cemeteries.  TARL archives.</div>
