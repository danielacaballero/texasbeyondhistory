<div class="caption"> This set of three large thin bifaces were grave offerings that, along with three large Corner Tang knives shown above, accompanied the burial of a 5 to 6 year old child who was buried in the same pit and at the same time as an adult male. The bifaces are quarry blanks or unfinished bifaces made of high-quality chert (flint) from the Edwards Plateau. They represent trade or exchange pieces and were valuable offerings – the chert cobbles found in the nearby San Antonio river are of lower quality and much too small to make large bifaces from.
