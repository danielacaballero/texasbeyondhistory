<h1>Carvajal Crossing and El Fuerte del Cibolo</h1>
	<p>Through time, travelers sought the safest and simplest ways to cross rivers and 		
	streams. Trails leading over some of the more heavily used crossings eventually became 	
	roads and were described in journals and denoted on maps. Some crossings took on 	
	particular strategic importance. </p>

	<p>One such site, <strong>Carvajal Crossing</strong>, was located at a natural rock-lined ford of 	
	Cibolo Creek. Likely a crossing for native peoples—its use perhaps extending into the 	
	prehistoric past—it gained prominence with the coming of Spanish missionaries, 	
	soldiers, and government officials.  Situated midway on the road between the <em>villa	
	</em> of San Antonio de Bexar and the presidio of La Bahia in present Goliad, the 
	crossing was a 	critical waypoint for travelers during the 18th century. The area, rich 	
	in rolling grasslands, was home to several Spanish <em>ranchos</em>—arguably, it was 
	here that ranching in America got its start. Many of the ranchos supported large herds 	
	of cattle for the missions. But raids on herds and homes by Apaches were a constant 		
	threat for these early settlers. </p>
	
	<p>To strengthen defenses and provide more security for these vital enterprises, 	
	Governor Manuel de Sandoval ordered more soldiers to the presidio in San Antonio. And 	
	to protect their horses from the Indian raiders, he positioned the herds at the remote 
	site on the Cibolo. A small outpost, or fort, was erected at the site in 1734 and a 
	small garrison of soldiers posted there. Called <strong>El Fuerte de Santa Cruz del Cibolo
	</strong>, or El Fuerte del Cibolo, the small fort likely consisted of nothing more 
	substantial than <em>jacales</em>, structures made of mud and sticks, and a few dugouts. 
	It existed only three years, however, before it had to be abandoned, following two 
	raids in which more than 400 horses were stolen.  The remaining herds and soldiers were 	
	moved back to San Antonio. </p>

	<p>In spite of the Indian threat, travel increased on the mission road, and more 	
	ranches were established, including the first privately owned ranch in Texas, that of 
	Andres Hernandez, in the vicinity of the outpost. In 1771, following a series of 
	readjustments in Spanish Colonial policy to increase frontier protection, the fort was 
	re-established on the Cibolo. This time, the fort was built with a wooden stockade in 
	which ranchers could seek shelter. For roughly 10 years, the soldiers helped protect 
	area ranches as well as the mail route between Presidio la Bahia and San Antonio de 
	Bexar. By 1782, however, hostilities with the Comanche increased to the point that the 
	fort was once again closed; this time the buildings were burned to prevent their use by 	
	Indians. Some ranches also were abandoned, leaving only 6 or 7 still operating and less 	
	than 100 Spanish settlers in the area. </p>

	<p>In 1838, the land encompassing the crossing and fort site was given to Jose Luis de 
	Carvajal by his aunt, Barbara Sanchez, who had inherited the tract in the Hernandez 
	grant.  Caraval, a descendant of a Canary Islander family, reportedly built a dugout 
	structure, covered with  green saplings, near the crossing. He and his wife, Maria de 
	Jesus Flores, raised nine children on the ranch. During that time, they maintained a 
	peaceful co-existance with a group of Lipan Apache reportedly living in a village 
	across the river. Ultimately, the Carvajals and Lipans were both driven away by the 
	Comanche. </p>

	<p>In 1985, in advance of a bridge-widening project on FM887 near the crossing, 
	archeologists from the Texas Department of Transportation conducted test excavations at 	
	the site thought to encompass the location of the Spanish Colonial fort. They uncovered 	
	more than 4000 artifacts, including sherds of Spanish Colonial ceramics (tin- and 
	lead-glazed wares including Red-brown and Galera Ware and Majolicas), later European 
	ceramics, bone- and sand-tempered Indian ceramics and chipped stone tools, as well as 
	quantities of animal bone. Investigators also identified several features 
	(distributional patterns and other traces) as a  faunal refuse dump with bison and 
	cattle remains, an Indian  ceramics dump, and the remnants of an early 19th-century 
	<em>jacal</em> structure, perhaps related to one of the early ranching operations. </p>

	<p>Two publications consulted for this short section provide a wealth of fascinating 
	detail on the area’s rich history and the evidence uncovered at the site, including 
	many additional photos. Archeologist Cynthia Tennis of the Center for Archaeological 
	Research at the University of Texas and other researchers surveyed the regional 
	ethnohistory and analyzed the site evidence for a report of findings with the Texas 
	Department of Transportation. Historian Robert H. Thonhoff consulted with area 
	landowners and visited several other intriguing related sites for his award-winning 
	book, <em>El Fuerte del Cibolo, Sentinel of the Bexar-La Bahia Ranches</em>, documenting 
	the	fort and its history, with illustrations by Jack Jackson. </p>
