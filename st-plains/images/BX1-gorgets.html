These gorgets (chest pieces) made from marine conch (Lightening Whelk) shells were burial offerings.  Three have designs of drilled impressions, one of which also has notched edges.  And three have holes at the bottom (wide end), perhaps for suspending smaller items below it or perhaps for adding a cord to hold the heavy gorgets more tightly against the chest.  These artifacts represent trade with coastal peoples and considerable craftsmanship, and must have been powerful symbols.
