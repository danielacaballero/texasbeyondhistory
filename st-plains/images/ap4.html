<h1>Anthon Site</h1>
	<p>The Anthon Site (41UV60) is a campsite on a terrace of the Nueces River 		
	in southern Uvalde County, about 25 miles below the Balcones Escarpment.  Although this 	 puts the site in the northwestern part of the South Texas Plains, it is within  a broad ecotone or ecological transition zone between the Edwards Plateau to 	
	the north and the core of the South Texas Plains to the south.</p>

	<p>Excavations at the Anthon site documented numerous chipped and ground stone artifacts 	dating to the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods including dart points, arrow 	
	points, bifacial knives, flake tools and manos.  Though organic material (such as 	
	animal bone) was not preserved, the large chipped stone assemblage at the site allowed 	
	archeologists to gain insight into the behavior of groups who moved between the South 	
	Texas Plains and the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic period, about 3,000 years 
	ago (1,000 B.C.).</p> 

	<p>Archeologists from the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (now 
	TXDOT) discovered the Anthon site in early 1974 in advance of the paving of FM 481.  
	Excavations were undertaken at the site in the following year, but analysis of the site 	assemblage did not take place for a number of years.  The results of this analysis were 	ultimately reported by TXDOT  nearly three decades after the 	
	fieldwork concluded. </p>

	<p>Report author, Glenn T. Goode, an accomplished flintknapper and lithic analyst, carried out an exhaustive 	
	analysis of the stone tools recovered from the site.  Though tools from the Late 
	Archaic through the Late Prehistoric were represented in the assemblage, Goode’s 	
	analysis focused on tools from the earliest part of the Late Archaic period, which he 
	referred to as the Round Rock period.  The analysis centered on Pedernales and Kinney 	
	dart points,  the most common projectile point styles in the Round Rock layers of 
	the site.</p>

	<p>Goode used his experience in flintknapping along with use-wear analysis to determine 	that, although Pedernales points from Anthon showed evidence of use as projectile 	
	points, Kinney “points” mostly seemed to have been used as knives.  Though he argued 
	convincingly that the two artifact types served mainly different functions, Goode 
	observed strong similarities in how the Pedernales and Kinney points/knives were 	
	produced.  He inferred that  both styles were made by individuals sharing a single 
	cultural tradition.  He also undertook a study of the documented distributions of 
	Pedernales and Kinney points and showed that the two types have only been found 
	together in large numbers in the ecotonal area between the Edwards Plateau and South 	
	Texas Plains.</p>

	<p>Adding up  the evidence, Goode argued that Pedernales and Kinney were 		
	 complimentary implements – dart head and butchering knife, respectively – in a lithic toolkit used by related Indian groups who 	
	lived mainly on the nearby Edwards Plateau.   These Late Archaic 
	peoples, he reasoned, camped at the Anthon site during periodic movements south from their primary territory to exploit the unique resources found in the 
	ecotone between the Edwards Plateau and South Texas Plains. This is a good lesson – the
 	geographic and ecological regions we archeologists use today as convenient study areas 	
	do not always, or perhaps even often, neatly coincide with prehistoric cultural 	
	boundaries.  Goode’s  study shows the value of a well-informed lithic 	
	analysis, particularly at sites such as Anthon where poor preservation conditions give 	
	us only a limited set of evidence – stone tools, tool-making debris, cooking stones, 	
	and little else.  This  challenging circumstance is true of a great many archeological sites across 	
	the South Texas Plains.</p>
