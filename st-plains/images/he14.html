<h1>Early Ranching on the Northern Frontier of New Spain</h1>
		<p>Although wild cattle had drifted northward from ranchos in central Mexico since the 1500s, 
		cattle ranching in South Texas began in 1749, when Jos&eacute; de Escand&oacute;n, the governor of Nuevo Leon, 
		brought 3,000 settlers and 146 soldiers to settle the area bordering the Rio Bravo (now known as 
		the Rio Grande river). This area, the northernmost stretch of the province of Nuevo Santander, had not been inhabited by the Spanish, although expeditions had travelled across portions of it on several occasions. </p>
		<p>These early ranchos on the Rio Grande were established at a price: among many other 
		hardships, the settlers had to forge a new life on the frontier under constant threat of attack by 
		hostile Indians. In spite of this, ranching on the border was a success, with some of Texas’ most 
		treasured traditions emerging from that early Spanish heritage.</p>
		<p>The first settlers came from ranching communities in Queretaro, Nuevo Leon, and Coahuila, where 
		they had already learned how to live and raise cattle successfully in those arid regions.  These small settlements, or <em>villas</em>, along the Rio Grande, together with the vast ranches supplying the missions near San Antonio and Goliad, were the birthplace of the American cattle industry. Some of these Rio Grande ranches grew into settlements, becoming towns and cities. On this far-south stretch of the river, Captain Bl&aacute;s Mar&iacute;a de la Garza Falc&oacute;n, already a 
		wealthy rancher, received a land grant totaling 433,500 acres across the Rio Grande from Camargo.  He 
		established the ranch of Carnestolendas with 15 families on the north side of the river in 1752.  The 
		headquarters would later be called "Rancho Davis" and in 1848 would become Rio Grande City.</p> 
        <p>The first land grants were laid out in <em>porci&oacute;nes,</em> long thin strips of land beginning at the river and 
stretching inland (on both sides of the Rio Grande). This odd configuration assured water for each landowner.  Ranchers moving 
into the arid brush country beyond the porci&oacute;nes needed and received very large land grants to support 
their cattle. <FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN

        <P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><O:P></O:P></SPAN></FONT>They built ranch headquarters where there was a steady supply of water, usually from 
  springs; water was also collected at ground level and stored in cisterns.  Ranchers provided water for 
  their herds in one of two ways:  by an earthen dam (<em>presa</em>) constructed across an arroyo to create a small 
  lake or by a hand-dug well (<em>noria con buque</em>). </P>
        <p>To build a presa, workers collected earth from the front of the dam and carried it in rawhide 
containers to the top, where they emptied the containers.  Draft animals walking back and forth packed 
the earth down to make the dam.  A spillway made of <em>sillares</em> (caliche blocks) completed the project.  
This type of dam and reservoir was built at El Randado in Jim Hogg County during the 1830s.   More common 
was the noria con buque.  Laborers dug the well with tools made by blacksmiths.  The noria, which could be 
either circular or rectangular, was lined with hand-quarried sillares.  Two walls were built up on either 
side to support a mesquite log placed horizontally above the well.  A long rope was placed over the log, 
with one end tied to a rawhide bucket and the other to an ox or mule.  The draft animal pulled on the rope 
to raise the bucket and reversed to lower it.  Often a large holding tank, made of sillares and covered 
with lime plaster, was built adjacent to the well.  </p>
<p>The ranchers brought with them other Spanish traditions.  They organized their landholdings as 
  <em>hacienda</em>s.  A hacienda engaged in any money-making business: lumber, sheep, mining, farming, etc.  
However, the further north from central Mexico the haciendas spread, the more they became limited to 
cattle raising and the larger they grew in order to support the herds.  Over time, the hacienda became an 
enclosed community, a feudal estate, whose workers and their families were answerable only to the 
  <em>hacendado</em> or patron (ranch owner).  The landowners provided food, clothing, shelter, and religious 
instruction to the native Indian or <em>mestizo</em> (mixed Indian and Spaniard), who provided their labor.  
The hacendado and his family lived in a large house made of sillar blocks quarried on the property.  
Most early ranch complexes often were surrounded by stone walls for security or had other defensive fortifications. The <em>casa mayor</em> (main house) had <em>troneras</em> (gunports) built into the walls and served as a fort during the 
frequent attacks from Comanche and Lipan Apache Indians.  </p>
<p>The vaqueros and hacienda laborers and their families lived in one-room huts, or <em>jacales</em>.  A jacal was 
made of mesquite poles placed upright, supported by forked horcones (corner posts).  Limbs were placed 
horizontally across the poles, and mud or adobe filled the openings between the limbs.  Forked poles 
centered on the end walls supported the ridgepole beneath the thatched roof.  Women cooked in a grass or 
corn stalk <em>ramada</em> (arbor) near the jacal, and the family ate outdoors.  A few goats or chickens lived in 
a pen; corn, beans, and pumpkins grew in a garden near the house.</p>
<p> Most traces of the Spanish Colonial 
  cattle days&#8212;ruins of ranch structures, stone walls, and wells&#8212;on the Rio Grande are  on private property. There are a few sites, such as those at San Isidro 
  and San Ignacio, which can be seen by the public.   A 19th-century jacal still stands at Los Saenz, near Rio Grande City, where it can be viewed from the street. Even without a physical presence, however, the Spanish Colonial ranching traditions still remain strong. They have pervaded our culture and remain in the form of language 
  and music, clothing, saddles, tools, round-ups and rodeos, cattle drives, and the mythic image of the 
  American cowboy. </p>
