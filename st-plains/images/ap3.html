<h1>Chaparrosa  Ranch</h1>
<p>The first archeological field school by the University of  Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) was held in June and July 1974 at the Chaparrosa  Ranch in Zavalla County. The field  school director was an assistant professor who was younger than all but one of  the students enrolled in the course, among whom were four retired Air Force  colonels. Headquarters were established  at a hunter&rsquo;s cabin, watered by a well and with an air-conditioned dining  area. One of the colonels plugged in his  spacious travel home, while other students put up tents under mesquite trees  that provided some shade for at least a portion of the day. Carefully-crafted, handmade, fortress-level  latrines stood in the middle of a clearing downwind. The climate was typically hot and humid, and  as also predictable in June, broken by a  ferocious seven-inch rainstorm. </p>
<p>The camp had a number of characters, visitors, and memorable  moments. T. C. Hill, Jr. of Crystal City  brought his guitar and thick compilation of Mexican <em>canciones</em> and sang  well into the morning hours. A very  aggressive bull &ldquo;penned up&rdquo; several latrine occupants for quite a while, and on  another visit, ran one of the colonels up a nearby windmill. One night, two unexpected visitors arrived  late, on foot and very drunk. After  drinking from one of the camp&rsquo;s water faucets for a good while, they collapsed  on the ground near the cabin, sound asleep.  These lost and exhausted wanderers had no idea that their presence in  the camp that night had been monitored in the shadows by Col. Tom Kelly,  holding a loaded pistol. The next morning, when our visitors came to, the  students fed them and sent them on their way, with enhanced provisions and  better funding, courtesy of that same colonel who had followed their every move  the night before.</p>
<p>All field schools have their stories and a mythology that  grows over the years that follow. And  even though the field school members and their guests celebrated the 4th  of July with one too many vodka-filled watermelons, some memories will always  be clear. What is lost in many field school stories is just how hard the  students worked, sweated, and endured--whether or not the field school taught  them much &ldquo;archaeology,&rdquo;--or if the six-week exercise led to new data relating  to defined research problems. The  students of the 1974 UTSA field school succeeded admirably in their tasks, and  their work certainly added to the director&rsquo;s research goals formulated four  years earlier.</p>
<p><strong>The Chaparrosa Archaeological Project</strong></p>
<p>Chaparrosa Ranch covers 70,000 acres of Zavala County, in  the southwestern part of the South Texas Plains. Drained by two major, parallel tributaries of  the Nueces River &ndash; Turkey Creek and Chaparrosa Creek-- a broad valley has been  created along a north-south axis. The  two creeks have cut many channels across the valley, creating a braided pattern  of drainages and isolating several landforms.  The valley walls on the west and east are well defined and capped by  outcrops of Uvalde gravels, a source of cherts used in ancient stone-tool  making in the region. The streams are  lined with heavily vegetated riparian zones and the floodplains support a  variety of plants that were exploited as food resources. The combination of vegetation zones,  scattered specialized ecological niches, and the presence of sustained water sources  have also created conditions for abundant wildlife. The natural resources, enhanced by documents  on the area, its resources, and its native peoples ranging from the 18th  century through the early 20th century, have provided an excellent &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo;  for examining the Native American settlement of a contiguous environment  encompassing more than 40 square miles.</p>
<p>In August, 1969, Wayne T. Hamilton, then the business  manager for the Ranch (now Professor of Range Science at Texas A&amp;M  University) made arrangements for an initial visit to the ranch, owned at that  time by the late Belton Kleberg Johnson.  Accompanied by T. C. Hill, Jr., and with the encouragement of the late  Jack Youngblood (foreman), we drove to several parts of the ranch, looking at  and recording several sites. It was soon clear that there were some buried  sites on the ranch, and that the Chaparrosa and Turkey Creeks had formed a  distinctive valley, and that numerous resources had existed &ndash; from chert  outcrops on the edges of the valley to the water and vegetation of the stream courses&mdash;that  would have favored repeated prehistoric occupations. </p>

<p>Recognizing these opportunities, the Chaparrosa  Archaeological Project was initiated by a survey and testing program in 1970,  supported by a grant from the University of California, Berkeley, and equipment  and a vehicle from Texas State Archeologist Curtis Tunnell and TARL Director,  Dee Ann Story. This work was followed by  UTSA field schools in 1974 and 1975, and intermittent survey activities through  the early 1980s. The archeological investigations  resulted in major excavations at two sites, testing and controlled collecting  at many others, and the use of systematic survey techniques to document more  than 250 other sites on all landforms. The data from Chaparrosa Ranch were used  for initial studies of settlement systems and in the development of research  plans for fieldwork in the region.</p>
<p>The terrain has the typical vegetation of the South Texas  Plains, with mesquite and all of its thorn-bearing associates, prickly pear  cactus and tasajillo, cenizo, guajillo, and blackbrush, granjeno, and  whitebrush, and a myriad of other plants that contribute to the special smells  of the area. Two major streams run  through the ranch, from north to south.  The deeper, more densely vegetated is the Chaparrosa Creek, with deep  pools in some areas and dry channels in others.  Flowing springs once issued forth from a major sandstone outcrop on  the north part of the ranch. Paralleling the Chaparossa Creek, in its own  valley and separated by the &ldquo;divide&rdquo; between the two streams, is Turkey  Creek. It is a less impressive waterway,  muddy, with the riparian forest being more brush than anything else. In aerial photos, its braided channels are clear,  indicating the shifts of the primary channel over the millennia. Below the  confluence of the two creeks, Turkey Creek drains south toward Crystal City, ending  in a vast swampland often called &ldquo;Comanche Lake,&rdquo; a Anglicized rendition of  what the 18th century Spanish (who were sometimes lost in the thick  brush there) called &ldquo;the Caramanchel&rdquo; (the name probably derived from a village  near Madrid). Spanish expeditions that  crossed Chaparrosa and Turkey Creeks in the late 17th and into the  18th centuries gave various names to Chaparrosa Creek, including &ldquo;Rio  de San Isidro Labrador,&rdquo; &ldquo;Arroyo San Luca.,&rdquo; According to Father Massanet in  1691, the creek was called &ldquo;Guanapacti&rdquo; by local Indian groups. It is not known whether this was the  landscape name used by the Pacuache Indians, likely the resident historic group  in the Chaparrosa area, or that of another group.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Research Goals and Attempts to Implement Them</strong></p>
<p>Beginning with the 1970 survey and testing program, the  Chaparrosa Archeological Project had two stated goals: </p>
<ol>
  <li>1. to  record and sample sites in varied topographical and ecological locales &ndash; to  help reconstruct, on a preliminary basis, the prehistoric settlement-subsistence  systems;</li>
  <li>2. to  locate and test sites with buried deposits, hoping to find those with  sufficient depth to warrant larger excavations, and which would hopefully help  toward establishing a sound cultural sequence.</li>
</ol>
<p>I (Tom Hester) felt that chronology (Goal 2) was especially  important, if the settlement- subsistence system study (Goal 1) was to be  meaningful in studying regional prehistory.</p>
<p>These objectives, and the techniques used to implement them,  reflected the archaeology of the early 1970s, at least in the mind of a  Berkeley graduate student! Loosely  derived from &ldquo;systems theory,&rdquo; the research sought to link settlement patterns  (distribution of sites during known periods of time) with evidence of  subsistence strategies (what people ate and how they exploited food resources). Very generally put, the goal was to conjoin data  on the distribution and types of sites with data that would inform us on  subsistence, seasonality, and paleoenvironment.  Having been trained initially as a Texas archeologist, I felt that such  patterns and interpretations needed to be grounded with a solid cultural  chronology, else such patterns would be a mish-mash of archaeological evidence  from various time periods.</p>
<p>The techniques or strategies used to pursue these concerns  in the Chaparrosa Ranch region included: </p>
<p><u>Site recording</u>, some based on surveys of &ldquo;high  probability&rdquo; areas, and to areas known to ranch personnel -- but with the use  of east-west <em>transects</em> across the  stream valley so that temporary, task-specific, or other types of habitation  sites might be discovered. Because Chaparrosa Ranch was an efficiently  organized place, there were ranch roads and transmission lines nicely spaced,  east-west, to facilitate these transects.</p>
<p><u>Site sampling </u>involved surface collection and, at  select sites, test excavations. The Mariposa site, 41ZV83 (below, the &ldquo;41&rdquo;  prefix will be dropped for all site numbers), had been tested in 1970, and so  in the 1974, it became the first site to be excavated using an &ldquo;open-area&rdquo; or  block approach.<strong> </strong>Surface collecting  approaches were varied: some were &ldquo;grab&rdquo; or opportunistic sampling of  diagnostics and other materials judged to be interpretative value; controlled  collecting using grid systems<strong>,</strong> and even a site or two with the  then-famous Binfordian &ldquo;dog leash technique&rdquo; (in reference to archeologist  Lewis Binford). </p>
<p><u>Site excavation</u> was carried out in hopes of  chronological data, subsistence data (faunal remains, for example),  paleoenvironmental samples (pollen columns), and hoped-for intrasite patterning  of hearths and other features that might provide insights as to how site space  was used. Open-area, or blocks of  adjacent units, excavations were used,  standardized &frac14;&rdquo; screening, and selected  1/8&rdquo; and water screening<strong>.</strong><br>
    <strong></strong><br>
  Unfortunately, faunal remains were very poorly preserved and  pollen samples yielded no environmental data.  Efforts to carefully collect charcoal for radiocarbon dating was very  difficult: very little survived and often in associations not worth dating.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Results</strong></p>
<p>A brief summary of the data from Chaparrosa Ranch gives a  good idea of what the research accomplished. A number of publications exist  that document much of the work, especially the excavations at the Mariposa site  (ZV83). Texas Tech graduate student John  Montgomery reported that site for his Master&rsquo;s thesis, which was subsequently  published by UTSA. The archives and collections of the Chaparrosa  Archaeological Project are housed at the Center for Archaeological Research at  UTSA. These include numerous,  unpublished graduate student papers, a draft of part of an unfinished dissertation, field notes, photographs, and other records. While much analysis has been accomplished, an  overall presentation and synthesis of the Chaparrosa Archaeological Project  remains to be done. </p>
<p>A total of 167 sites were formally recorded on Chaparrosa  Ranch, ranging in age from Late Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric. Based on the nature of the archaeological materials  at these various sites and a study of their topographic and environmental  contexts, a series of site definitions were set forth. Major site categories  include:</p>
<p><strong>Streamside Villages:</strong> These  are common along Chaparrosa and Turkey Creeks, often atop (and buried in) long,  low natural levees paralleling the stream channels. Gullies cutting through  them, draining into the creeks, expose burned rock (sandstone, chert), flakes,  mussel shell fragments, and large numbers of <em>Rabdotus</em> land snails. At  such sites where there is less vegetation, sheet erosion also exposes  cultural remains. Two such sites have  been excavated at Chaparrosa Ranch: Mariposa and ZV10. Both were deposits about 1.40 meters  deep, with dark gray-brown midden-stained alluvium, overlying tan clays. At site Mariposa, small hearths and  scattered hearth stones were in the upper 45 cm (midden soils), along with  Perdiz, Scallorn, and Zavala points; all excavated materials were plotted in  place as detailed in John Montgomery&rsquo;s 1975 monograph. Radiocarbon dates range from 1400 to 400  years ago. </p>
<p>At ZV10, on Turkey Creek downstream from the Mariposa site,  the upper alluvial clay-loam is midden-stained, with pale brown clays below.  After the site was probed with four test pits in 1974, it was excavated in 1975  with a block of nine 2-meter squares. Most of the cultural material was  concentrated from 14-45 cm, including a dozen concentrations of fire-cracked  sandstone (hearths), a charcoal-baked clay concentration, and two other baked  clay clusters. </p>
<p>In a closer look at  vertical distribution of artifacts, the Late Prehistoric (Perdiz, Scallorn, Zavala)  occurs from surface to 30 cm. Just  below, where the hearths were concentrated, were Ensor, Zavala, and Montell  points. And toward the bottom of the excavations. between 45-75 cm, fire  cracked rock was less frequent, and diagnostics included a Marcos point and two  examples of the heat-treated &ldquo;Shumla&rdquo; form found widely in this section of the  South Texas Plains. There were also cores, biface fragments, a large bifacial  perforator, and a section of large antler tine. Faunal remains were recovered, although in  small numbers and mostly from the Late Prehistoric; much of the recovery was  through water-screening. All of the identified fauna is likely not all  archaeological. The site had rodent  burrowing and vertisol cracks which could have introduced some species. Briefly, the fauna included frogs, turtle,  snakes (7 species), lizard, alligator gar, raccoon, ringtail, skunk, rats,  mice, rabbits, whitetail deer and pronghorn antelope.</p>
<p><strong>Lithic Procurement Sites: </strong>The edges of the valley are  topped with outcrops of &quot;Uvalde&quot; Gravels, as are some upland remnants isolated by  erosion near the floodplain. (See <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/st-plains/nature/images/uvalde-W.html" target="_blank">&quot;Uvalde&quot; Gravels West</a>.) At the  lithic procurement sites, the ancient gravel deposits are heavily concentrated, with  abundant flake debris, occasional cores, &ldquo;tested&rdquo; cobbles (one or two flakes  removed), brown-purple quartzite hammerstones, and, rarely, lithic  diagnostics. The exposed occupation  sites on the edge and top of the valley walls often have Paleoindian and Early  Archaic artifacts, including Angostura, Golondrina, and bifacial Clear Fork  tools.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Upland Sites:</strong>  The uplands east and west of the creek valley are marked by red sand and  broad stands of grass (much of this due to thorn-brush removal programs in the  1960s). There are no water sources, and  the sites are small, with meager cultural remains. At ZV90, there was a hearth with several  flakes and a core-chopper around it; site  ZV89 was very similar. These are thought to be temporary, function-specific  sites, such as hunting and/or gathering camps used briefly by a small group. Because of the sand and grass in much of the  uplands, sites have to be located via transects, usually along east-west ranch  roads that are somewhat eroded.</p>
<p>In addition to these kinds of sites, survey crews recorded a  variety of features partially exposed on eroded surfaces or in gullies. These included a cache of manos  (41ZV66), a pit filled with ashes,  charcoal and baked clay lumps (41ZV82), and a number of sites with distinct  chipping areas.</p>
<p>Roadrunner &ldquo;snail kill&rdquo; localities are found on Chaparrosa  Ranch and across the South Texas Plains.  The roadrunner uses an appropriate exposed stone cobble and brings <em>Rabdotus</em> snails and smashes them on the &ldquo;anvil.&rdquo; A litter of broken<em> Rabdotus</em> shell will be found over an area 1-2 meters in diameter. Such concentrations may be mistaken for  archeological sites, but the latter always contain many whole shells.</p>
<p><strong>Chronological Indicators</strong></p>
<p>Excavated sites yielded artifacts from the Late Prehistoric  into the Late Archaic. These and other  artifacts were recovered during surveys and controlled collecting at many  Chaparrosa sites. And some artifacts  were shown us by Hamilton and Soil Conservation Service personnel, collected in  the years prior to the survey. Clovis  and Folsom points have been found on the ranch, or on property immediately  adjacent. More common are Angostura, Golondrina,  and St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall, and at two sites near the valley  wall east of Turkey Creek, Golondrina points and a Clear Fork biface (ZV433 and  ZV436). Archaic point types are common,  with considerable numbers of stemmed points typical of the northern part of the  South Texas Plains, including Andice, Martindale, Langtry, Pedernales, Frio and  Ensor. Still, unstemmed triangular  points dominated: Abasolo, Catan,  Tortugas, Matamoras, Kinney, Desmuke, and the basal-notched Carrizo. Late Prehistoric types include Perdiz,  Scallorn, and Zavala. Interestingly, few  indicators of the Toyah Horizon are present at Chaparrosa Ranch, and no  bone-tempered pottery has yet been found.  In this regard, the Late Prehistoric assemblage is very similar to the  &ldquo;Mission Indian&rdquo; tool kit of the Gateway missions to the west.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>The archeological research at Chaparrosa Ranch in 1974 and 1975 provided data  on settlement types and distributions that was based on a  systematically-designed survey, which included transects across the  valley, rather than &ldquo;big&rdquo; site recording  that has been standard practice in the region up to that time. Our  excavations demonstrated that Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic sites are to be  found on the natural levees paralleling the creeks &ndash; at least in those areas  that we dug. At both ZV83 and ZV10, deep  gully erosions in other parts of the site revealed Middle Archaic points. Test pits indicated little promise for  excavation, and it may be that the Middle Archaic materials are eroded and  redeposited from early floods in this drainage system. Whatever the reason, we were unable to locate  any sites that looked promising for deeper excavations. There was a hint of &ldquo;horizontal stratigraphy,&rdquo;  with Golondrina, Clear Fork bifaces, as well as Early Archaic dart points found  eroded on the east edge of the Turkey Creek drainage, quite distinct from the  streamside villages to the west. </p>
<p>We met some of our goals and others proved  unachievable. The faunal record at<br>
  ZV10 is a lengthy list, but the collection is small and much  of it potentially introduced by natural processes. Charcoal from the hearths at ZV10 and ZV83  provided some
  assays that seem to fit the archaeology of the site, but we  had too few samples. Palynological  research of the 1970s did not yield pollen data; soil samples are still curated  at CAR-UTSA that might be processed by more recent techniques.</p>
<p>Regional surveys on the South Texas Plains, on the scale of  the Chaparrosa project,<br>
  have been done only occasionally during the past 30 years. Unfortunately, none have been properly  finished and reported, including Chaparrosa.  Such undertaking are difficult to accomplish without major funding. Fully completed, systematic regional surveys, are  very worthy research projects that we badly need to improve our understandings  of the prehistory of the South Texas Plains. </p>
