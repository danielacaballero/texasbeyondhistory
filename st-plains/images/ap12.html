<h1>Smith Creek Bridge</h1>
    <p>The Smith Creek Bridge site (41DW270) in southeastern DeWitt County was discovered in 1997 by local archeological steward (of the Texas Historical Commission), E.H. &quot;Smitty&quot; Schmiedlin, during construction of a bridge on State Highway 119, just south of the 
	town of Yorktown.  Testing at the site showed that it contained deposits significant enough to 
	halt construction for a period of five weeks so that archeologists could conduct an emergency 
	excavation. Archeologists from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) led the analysis of 
	the site’s deposits as part of one of that organization’s last Cultural Resource Management (CRM) 
	contracts.</p>
	<p> The vast majority of artifacts recovered from the site date to the Middle and Late Archaic periods 
	including dart points, bifacial knives, flake tools, cores and ground stone tools as well as chert 
	débitage from stone tool manufacture.  The most notable component preserved at the site contains 
	material used by groups carrying Morhiss projectile points during the Late Archaic, around 800 B.C.  
	The Morhiss component, named for the <a href="../../morhiss/index.html" target="_blank">Morhiss Mound</a> site where the dart point style was first identified, was selected for intensive analysis and the animal remains and stone tools recovered 
	yielded a great deal of information about these groups.</p>
	<p> The wide range of animal remains recovered from the Morhiss component at the site include 
	deer, rabbit, lizards, snakes, turtles, fish and mussels.  This diversity  led archeologists 
	to conclude that Morhiss groups were “broad spectrum” foragers who did not focus on the hunting of one 
	particular resource such as bison.  Some of the animal remains also helped archeologists determine when 
	these foraging groups occupied the site.  Remains of fish and mussels along with some evidence from 
	bison remains indicate that groups occupied the site year round, perhaps focusing on fish such as 
	large-mouth bass during the fall and winter.</p> 
	<p> The stone tools found in the Morhiss component also helped to shed light on the people who 
	occupied the site during this time.  Many of the stone tools from this component, such as bifaces and 
	flake tools, are believed to represent “general use” tools that could be adapted to a number of 
	tasks.  Likewise, there is evidence that Morhiss projectile points were also used as knives.  This 
	technological flexibility is further evidence of a broad-based subsistence strategy on the part of 
	Morhiss groups.</p>
	<p> The Smith Creek Bridge site report represents what is best about CRM archeology.  Archeologists 
	worked tirelessly throughout the holiday season of 1997 to save the site’s materials from destruction 
	and their efforts were rewarded by a multi-disciplinary analysis that shed a great deal of light on 
	the lifeways of the prehistoric occupants of the site.</p>
