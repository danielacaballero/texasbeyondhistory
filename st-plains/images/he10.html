<h1>Battle with Cacaxtle</h1>
    <p>In this area, members of a large Spanish military expedition battled with Cacaxtle Indians in
    1665.</p>
<p>Cacaxtle was the name given by the Spanish to hunter-gathering groups that ranged from the Rio Grande
northeastward to present day Kinney County during the latter part of the 17th century. The name derives
from the Nahuatl language and is a term used to describe carrying packs, such as the netted wooden pack
frames carried by native peoples while gathering plant foods and other items.</p>
<p>Scant information about these groups is available with the exception of a history of Nuevo Leon written
by Juan Bautista Chapa in the 1690s. In it, he includes an account of two attacks perpetrated by the
Spanish on the Cacaxtle people.  According to Chapa, in 1663 and 1665, Spanish military
expeditions departed from Monterrey in search of Indians who had persisted in raiding Spanish settlements
along the border. The Indian groups they encountered may or may not have been  responsible for any raids,
but the resulting battles provide a  rare glimpse of  native strategy and traditions.</p>
<p>The first battle occurred in1663 and is estimated to have taken place 180 miles north of Monterrey.
Here, the Spanish came upon a Cacaxtle encampment and attacked. According to Chapa's brief account of
this expedition, approximately 100 Indians were killed and 125 were captured.</p>
<p>In this area, the second of the battles occurred, some 60 miles beyond the battle two years prior. This
time, the Cacaxtle may have been aware of the approaching Spanish and prepared for battle. Chapa noted
that the Cacaxtle had surrounded themselves with a defensive structure made from piles of tree trunks,
branches and prickley-pear pads. This defensive strategy delayed Spanish victory for some time. Throughout the
battle, an elderly Cacaxtle woman played a flute, perhaps to buoy the spirits of the Cacaxtle
warriors. The battle resulted, according to Chapa, in the deaths of approximatley 100 Indians and the
capture of 70 more. Of the Spanish, 22 were reportedly wounded.</p>
<p>Prior to battles with the Spanish, the estimated maximum Cacaxtle population  was about 500 individuals, a
figure consistent with most hunting and gathering groups in the area. After 1665, their populations had
been decimated by 80 percent having lost around 400 individuals over the past three years. The remaining
Cacaxtle likely merged with other Indian groups losing their ethnic identity in the process. This Indian
group &quot;never recovered from this shock&quot; and has become one of the only hunting and gathering
groups to be decimated solely by Spanish conflict.</p>
<p>What little is known about the Cacaxtle culture stems largely from Chapa's account of these battles. We find
they utilized defensive ramparts, carried distinctive packs on their backs for which they were named, and
that a woman, perhaps of some rank or spiritual signifigance, played a role in the battle. These characteristics are not reported in
accounts of other Indian groups in the area. </p>
