<h1>Silo Site</h1>
	<p>In the gently rolling landscape of central Karnes County, the Silo site 
	(41KA102) sits atop a low ridge  overlooking a small, unnamed, wet-weather creek that flows 
	into the San Antonio River to the south. Mesquite trees, hackberry, prickly pear cacti, 	
	and brush grow dense along this creek and its surroundings. Cattle meander through, 
	grazing on the patches of thin grass. Native peoples used the site for a camping spot 	
	at various times during the Archaic era. In the Late Archaic period, roughly 2000 years 	
	ago, people began to use the site as a cemetery. </p>

	<p>In the 1950s, a deep silage trench some 180 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 10 feet 	
	deep was dug down the length of the ridge, cutting straight through  the Silo site.  At the time, some ranchers used such trenches to store green 
	fodder for livestock feed, a practice now used rarely because of improved storage 	
	methods.  Some abandoned silage trenches were backfilled, but in this case the 	
	trench was left open and the walls slowly eroded. </p>

	<p>In 1995, some forty years after the trench’s excavation, the landowner noticed what 	
	he surmised were  human bones eroding out of the south wall of this trench. He contacted 	
	Dr. Thomas R. Hester at the University of Texas at Austin, who soon came down to take a 	
	look.  Hester and several of his students found the remains of several human burials 	
	eroding out of the south wall of the silage trench. Fire-cracked cooking stones, stone 	
	tool-making debris, animal bone fragments, freshwater mussel shells, and occasional 	
	stone tools, all evidence of intense prehistoric activity, were scattered across the 	
	surface of the ridge. The trench wall revealed a thick upper layer about a meter thick 
	(39 inches) within which were numerous artifacts similar to those found on the surface 	
	as well as human remains. </p>

	<p>It was obvious that the steep trench wall would continue to erode and destroy what 	
	remained of the burials.  Small-scale salvage excavations were undertaken the following 	
	year by student volunteers under the direction of Troy Lovata, then a graduate student 
	at UT-Austin. Salvage work continued intermittently for about two years.  Skeletal 
	remains representing about 25 individuals were encountered in five 1-x-1-meter 
	excavation units placed along the silage trench wall. Additional research by  Cory 
	Broehm and several other volunteers recovered one more burial and helped to define the site 
	more clearly. </p>

	<p>The prehistory of the site, aside from the burials themselves, is largely a 	
	mystery. The occupation zone had been heavily disturbed by humans in ancient and modern 	
	times as well as by the forces of nature, especially rodent burrowing and tree roots, 
	obscuring much of the site’s developmental history. People occasionally passed through 
	this location as early as the Paleoindian period and again in  Early Archaic, and possibly, 	
	Middle Archaic times. The only definitive evidence they seem to have left behind is a 	
	Paleoindian point base and, during the Early Archaic, an Early Triangular dart point 
	and several Clear Fork and Guadalupe adzes.  All of these artifacts, except one Guadalupe tool (see photograph), were found on the surface 
	of the ridge, but the limited testing suggested that whatever evidence of their activities might exist, it is likely  mixed in with that from later occupations. </p>

	<p>About 2000 years ago, peoples began to visit the Silo site more frequently and 
	stayed longer as well. Numerous fire-cracked rocks show the ridge was used for cooking 
	and perhaps heat-treating chert (flint) for stone tool manufacture.  Some of the cooking activities 
	could be related to rituals related to the cemetery, such as feasting. But most of the 
	occupational debris likely stems from ordinary camp activities. Flakes and bifacial 
	tools were made and sharpened to hunt game with darts tipped with  Ensor, Fairland, and Matamoros projectile points.  Mussel shells, and, no doubt, fish and other riverine species such as turtle, 
	were pulled  from the nearby stream or, more likely, from the San Antonio River itself. 
	Although no direct evidence was found, we can be sure that Late Archaic visitors were also 	
	gathering plant foods as well, such as pecans and prickly pear.  The site setting within 	
	the San Antonio River valley provided ready access to habitats ranging from the river 
	itself to dense riparian woodlands and nearby upland areas. </p>

	<p>At some point during the Late Archaic period, the group (or groups) who frequented 	
	the site began to think differently about the ridge and its place in the life of the 
	group and the landscape. Instead of just being a convenient camping place, a portion of 	
	the Silo site became designated as a place to bury their dead – a cemetery.  Burials 
	have also been found at two other Late Archaic sites nearby in Karnes County, including 	
	the Rudy Haiduk site (41KA23).  Neither of these sites has been investigated well and it 	
	is not certain whether these are also cemeteries or just places where isolated burials 
	occur. </p> 

	<p>The span of time during which the Silo ridge was used as a cemetery is unknown; no 	
	radiocarbon dating has been done. But as the number of burials grew, rather than expand 	
	the size of the cemetery across the ridge, which held ample room for more burials, 
	people chose to continue burying in the same small area where they had begun. As they 
	returned to the same small spot on the ridge over and over again, they dug through the 
	graves of those laid down before, to make new graves for the recently dead. </p>

	<p>The archeologists found striking evidence of the reuse of the cemetery. The first 	
	bones encountered, as little as 20 cm (8 inches) below surface, were usually 
	dissociated pieces of bone, or bones in jumbled masses. It was also not uncommon to 
	find, for example, an isolated skull, a headless body, or an articulated arm or ribs 
	and vertebrae with no other associated remains. The picture that emerged as each piece 
	of bone was mapped and cataloged was that this small plot was used and reused for 
	multiple interments, later burials cutting through earlier ones, often leaving part of 
	the disturbed body intact and articulated. Graves were then backfilled with the jumbled 	
	elements of those graves they had disturbed in their digging. Burials were as shallow 
	as 30 cm below the ground surface, but most were 70 to 90 cm deep. Only six burials, 
	invariably the deepest, were found whole and undisturbed. These are thought to 	
	represent the latest burial episodes at the site, and bodies which had been laid to rest in grave pits dug through earlier burials, causing additional mixing. </p>

	<p>The Silo “burial population,” or excavated sample, consists of about 25 individuals, 	
	many of whom were represented only by a few bones.  Careful study of human bones can 
	sometimes tell us a great deal about ancient life. There are several factors, however, 	
	that limit what can be learned from the Silo population.  To begin with, only a very 
	limited area of the site was excavated.  An unknown number of graves were destroyed by 
	the excavation of the silage trench and subsequent erosion. Based on the surviving 
	traces, we suspect that many more graves were originally present. The often incomplete 	
	skeletons further hinder what can be learned. </p>

	<p>Nonetheless, based on the recovered sample of the remains of a minimum of 25 
	individuals, the Silo site is remarkable for the large proportion of children buried 
	there. Analysis suggests that twelve of the recovered individuals were less than 20 
	years old at death and thirteen were older than 20 years. Nine were less than ten years 	
	old. Whether this is a chance occurrence that the area of the cemetery with the most 
	children survived while more adults were destroyed by the silage trench is unknown. 	
	Surely it is not a preservation bias, as the bones of younger persons are more fragile 
	and less likely to survive than those of adults. Nonetheless, the ratio of children to 
	adults is intriguing.  Two of the three individuals at Silo who were buried with grave 
	offerings are children, suggesting perhaps that the children in this society had a 
	relatively high status. </p>

	<p>Of the thirteen adults, seven are males and one is female. The gender of the others 	
	could not be determined. With a couple of exceptions, no real assessments of the ages 	
	of the adults could be made due to the fragmented and weathered condition of the bones.  	</p>

	<p>Few health problems were identified, although bone is usually one of the last 	
	tissues to show any sign of disease or ill health, and the absence of any of these 	
	signs in bone may simply mean the individual died before the skeleton was affected. Two 
	children exhibit some evidence of an infection in or around the ear, but this may or 
	may not have been the cause of death. One adult male shows evidence of a healed 
	fracture of the tibia (shin bone). The teeth of these people are usually heavily worn, 
	as is common with native groups with a gritty diet high in raw foods. This wear, 
	however, seems to buffer against the formation of cavities, which were largely absent 
	in the Silo population, although very common among prehistoric remains from the 
	Southern Edwards Plateau and the Lower Pecos Canyonlands.  This suggests the diet of 
	those buried at the Silo site was not based on the carbohydrate-rich (sugary) plants known 	
	to promote cavities. </p>

	<p>Worldwide, cemeteries are places that are considered sacred by those who bury their 	
	dead there.  The act of burying a loved one is almost always accompanied by ritual such 	
	as special ceremonies and sometimes by special offerings, many of which may have been 
	made of perishable organic materials such as leather, wood, and fiber. Much of the ritual and custom attending the burial of a person leaves little to no 
	  evidence in the archeological record, or may not be recognizable. </p>
	<p>For example,  	
	  most of the occupational debris at the Silo site is interpreted as evidence that the 
	  site was also an ordinary campsite. Yet, we cannot rule out the possibility that funerary 
	  rituals such as feasting in honor of the deceased may have contributed to the debris accumulation.  It could 
	  also be the case that much of the camping debris may have accumulated when people gathered 
	  to bury one of their own, rather than during ordinary camping episodes. Interestingly, artifacts (both on and below the surface) are 
	  most numerous on top of, and immediately around, the graves, and fall off considerably 
	  in density across the rest of the ridge. </p>
	<p>Nonperishable information available to the archeologist, such as the position of the 	
	body and its orientation, unusual or rare treatment such as cremation, and the 
	inclusion of highly valued objects in the grave are steeped in tradition and meaning, 
	but these are hidden as well. Comparisons of practices between or within 
	cemeteries, or changes through time, provide one analytical tactic  that can be employed to attempt to track the change in meaning and tradition, if not its substance. </p>

	<p>All the burials at the Silo site were single interments, with one exception. One 
	double burial was recorded, that of a young man who was buried with a 5 to 6 year old child. The dead 	
	were placed in the grave in a variety of positions. Many were semi-flexed (knees tucked 	
	in toward the chest) and lying toward one side or facing up. Several had the legs 	
	flexed under the body, the arms bent, and one hand placed on the pelvis the other on 
	the face. These are common burial positions among Late Archaic populations in southern 
	Texas. Only a single individual, a woman, was placed face down in an extended prone 
	position. The cultural beliefs and practices of the group apparently dictated this 
	woman required unusual treatment when she died. The reason for such a burial is 
	unknown, but a similar burial has been reported from the Ernest Witte site in Austin 
	County in southeast Texas.</p>
	<p> Another unusual pattern at the Silo site is that one person, 	
	  possibly two, had a small stone placed in the mouth when they were buried. This 
	  practice has so far only been documented at the Oso Dune site in Corpus Christi, 
	  although this is the kind of practice that is easy for archeologists to miss when 
	  excavating (who might reasonably assume that the rocks were simply from the surrounding	 	soil). </p>
	<p>Grave offerings are fairly common at many cemeteries, but few were found at the Silo 
	site. While few, they are dramatic. With the child of the double burial were three 
	large corner-tang bifaces (knives) and three large biface “blanks,” (thin bifaces 
	thought to represent unfinished tools) all made of Edwards chert from the eastern 
	Edwards Plateau.  These pristine artifacts  suggest that the child was held in very high 	
	esteem. Two similar large corner-tang knives (also of Edwards chert) accompanied 
	another adult male burial. The combination of quality, size, and context of these 
	artifacts, is exceptionally rare. Corner-tang knives as grave furnishings are known 
	from the Ernest Witte site and the Rudy Haiduk site.  Similar specimens from the 
	<a href="../../morhiss/index.html" target="_blank">Morhiss Mound</a> site along the Guadalupe River in Victoria County, and at the Bowser site in 
	Fort Bend County in southeast Texas may also have originally been with burials. </p>

	<p>Microscopic examination of the Silo bifaces revealed they had never been used, and 
	indeed the corner-tangs were probably never intended to be used. The corner tang or 
	notched rounded projection was used to hold the binding (probably sinew) to attach the 
	knife to a wooden handle.  The large size of the Silo knife blades, relative to their 
	tang and base was so great that actual use of the tool as a knife likely would have 
	resulted in the tool breaking. The fine form strongly suggests that the Silo Corner 
	Tangs were intended  for a ritual purpose such as accompanying the dead,  and were seen as symbols 
	of status,  authority,  or individual honor. </p>

	<p>Few other grave offerings were found at the site, but this may be in part due to 
	disturbed nature of many of the burials (and of the cemetery itself). The only other 
	artifact definitely placed in a grave was a marine shell pendant found with a child. 
	These are a relatively common grave good and may be the only surviving part of a 
	garment, or purely decorative. Two deer-antler billets (flintknapping tools) were 
	likely grave inclusions as well, but they were found within disturbed areas of the 
	cemetery and their association with  burials is uncertain. </p>

	<p>The corner-tangs and bifacial blanks, as well as the marine shell pendant, also 
	suggest the peoples at the Silo site traded with groups on the Edwards Plateau and as 
	well as along the coast. Such trade or exchange networks have been well-documented 
	during the Late Archaic at other sites throughout central, southern, and, especially, 
	inland southeast Texas.  At the Ernest Witte site, for example, there are exotic burial 
	goods made of materials that can be traced to the Midwest and Southeast, hundreds of 
	miles distant.  The trade in evidence at the Silo site was apparently more modest, but 
	nonetheless crucial for the exchange of idea, news, and goods, as well as  the development of 
	relationships between groups and individuals. </p>

	<p>In summary, the Silo cemetery provides a glimpse into the lives of Late Archaic 
	hunting and gathering peoples whose territory included the drainage basin of the San 
	Antonio River in the South Texas Plains.  Around 2000 to 1500 years ago, closely 
	related peoples (perhaps a single group) established a small cemetery on a ridge 
	overlooking the San Antonio River valley. They returned there many times to bury their 
	dead, especially their children, and often dug new graves which disturbed and displaced 	
	earlier graves.  This pattern suggests that the cemetery was used for several 
	generations and that enough time elapsed between burials that the exact grave locations 	
	were no longer known. </p>

	  <div class="caption"> These two deer antler billets are flintknapping tools used

		They were clearly  grave offerings, but could not be 
		linked to a specific burial. Similar artifacts have been found as
