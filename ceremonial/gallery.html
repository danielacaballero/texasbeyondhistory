                    their function and meaning. But we can make informed guesses 
                    about the ceremonial objects, based on their rarity and similarity 
                    with objects from other shrine caves.</p>
                  <p class="text">Among the artifacts of Ceremonial Cave are a 
                    finely crafted bracelet and pendants of semi-exotic (nonlocal) 
                    stone and ornaments of shell from coastal areas hundreds of 
                    miles away. There are also seemingly less rare objects whose placement, 
                    quantity, and completeness suggests that they were left there 
                    as offerings: spears with stone dart tips, curved hardwood 
                    &quot;rabbit sticks,&quot; and woven items. The fact that 
                    several spears are complete and that some are adorned with 
                    unusual fiber bolls containing tobacco also suggests these were 
                    intended not for hunting but as a special offerings. In many Puebloan groups, darts and &quot;prayer sticks,&quot;  have particular symbolic significance, carried in rituals by leaders and offered in quantity to spirits for protection and power. </p>
                  <p class="text">In striking contrast to the finely crafted and jeweled objects  in the cave were dozens and dozens of heavily worn fiber sandals. Their quantities were so large, in fact, that early investigator C.B. 
                    Cosgrove was moved to interpret them as the shoes of the pilgrims 
                    themselves, perhaps placed there along with their offerings 
                    as part of a ceremonial ritual. Some archeologists today are 
                    reluctant to accept this interpretation, compelling though 
                    it may be. Most if not all of the sandals&#151;and many of 
                    the other fiber objects, ranging from quids (chewed pieces 
                    of fiber) to yucca mats and cord aprons&#151;may have been  the clothing 
                    and day-to-day trappings of various earlier occupants of the 
                    cave. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today we can view the rare ornaments and offerings 
                    left in  ritual ceremony by prehistoric peoples along with 
                    what may or may not be merely rubbish, and we can continue 
                    to speculate as to the line of distinction. Lacking provenience 
                    information and documentation for most of the artifacts, the 
                    only other line of evidence still available is the age of 
                    the objects. Radiocarbon dating could help determine when 
                    the various artifacts were deposited, but no comprehensive 
                    dating of these artifacts has been undertaken. Dating of the hafted darts is the first step in this program, and results have shown them to relate to early  use of the cave by Late Archaic residents of the area who may or may not have become the people referred to as the Jornada   Mogollon.</p>
                  <h3>Who Were the Ceremonialists?</h3>
                  <p class="text">What can be said of the people behind the 
                    objects, the ceremonialists themselves&#151;probably many 
                    generations of them&#151;who came to the cave to leave their 
                    diverse offerings? Who were they and what was the meaning 
                    of their journey? Based on the cave's location and the similarity 
                    of the artifacts to other cultures of the Southwest, Ceremonial 
                    Cave was used early on by Late Archaic hunting and gathering   peoples and later by peoples of the   Jornada-Mogollon culture from about A.D.700 to 1450, close to the time of the   arrival of the Spanish in the Southwest.&nbsp; These later people lived first in   small pithouse hamlets and later in pueblo communities, raising small crops of   corn and beans, but also still practicing the earlier ways of hunting and   gathering.</p>
                  <p class="text">Near the caves of the Huecos is 
                    the site of Hot Well Pueblo, one of the largest in the area, 
                    and farther west, at El Paso, is <a href="../firecracker/index.html" target="_blank" class="text">Firecracker 
                      Pueblo</a>, occupied for a brief period around A.D. 1450. At the nearby site of <a href="../hueco/index.html" target="_blank">Hueco Tanks,</a> somewhat earlier villagers   (ca. A.D. 1075-1150) lived in subterranean pithouses, practicing small-scale farming. Water, trapped in the deep tanks, or <em>huecos</em>, drew people to the remarkable place. Based on the abundance of rock art there &#8212;miniature masks and dancers,  distinctive feathered serpent and  stepped-cloud altars&#8212; Hueco Tanks was not only an oasis in the desert but a place of spiritual significance for Jornada-Mogollon and other peoples. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Puebloan system of cosmology is complex, 
                    its ceremonies and rituals still shrouded in secrecy. But 
                    there is a special meaning attached to caves and crevices 
                    in the earth: these areas penetrate the underworld, or the 
                    Below, where the Pueblo supernaturals live. Leaving offerings 
                    is a way of more closely approaching these mystical regions. 
                    As explained by southwestern archeologists Florence Hawley 
                    Ellis and Laurens Hammack, the supernaturals are &quot;neither 
                    all good nor all bad, but they require offerings and persuasion 
                    to carry on their part of creativity and regulation of the 
                    universe.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">Specific objects, including turquoise, white 
                    shell, abalone shell, and red stones have great meaning within 
                    the Pueblo legends and are correlated with the various supernaturals, 
                    Sun and White Shell Woman, in particular. Specific sites&#151;caves 
                    and lakes&#151;are revered by Pueblos as the sipapu, or opening 
                    to the underworld; others are sunshrines, or both. During 
                    winter and summer solstice, offerings are placed in shrines, 
                    and prayers are offered.                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Among the Pueblos, bows for winter  offerings are painted red, a color applied to bows or arrows in summer only for  purposes of witchcraft.&nbsp; In terms of  Ceremonial Cave, many of the spears and foreshafts are painted red, suggesting  that they, too, may have been winter offerings for success in hunting.&nbsp; Similarly, some of the yucca stalks with  attached fiber bolls are also painted red, as are the more recent  tablitas.</p>
                  <p class="text"> In addition to the red paint,  these items  also may have been adorned with exotic ornaments. Ellis and Hammack note that among some of the Pueblos, &ldquo;a bead  should be tied to the backs of bows, the &lsquo;bead&rsquo; on one offered by Hunt Chief  being a pendant of abalone shell like those worn by images of the War gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether any of the shell beads or the  abalone pendants from Ceremonial Cave were attached to spears or prayer sticks  is unknown, but some of the pendants still have cordage in the suspension holes  and some of the beads are still strung on cordage.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Puebloan peoples are highly secretive 
                    about the nature of their rituals, even keeping them from 
                    other native peoples not connected to the ceremonies. Some 
                    observances involved long treks or pilgrimages, possibly of 
                    several weeks' duration, and with stops to place offerings 
                    at more than one shrine. For the ceremonialists at Acoma Pueblo, 
                    New Mexico, before 1900, this included stops at Chaco Canyon 
                    and Chimney Rock in what we know today as the Four Corners 
                    area. While we cannot say with certainty that similar beliefs 
                    and circumstances held sway at Ceremonial Cave, the similarity 
                    in artifacts is striking. </p>
                  <p>If the range and quantity of the objects 
                      is any measure, Ceremonial Cave has no equal in its part 
                      of the Southwest. It was, perhaps for many centuries, a 
                      shrine of great importance. The astonishing numbers of sandals, 
                      darts&#151;both complete and broken&#151;snares, pipes, 
                      prayer sticks, throwing or fending sticks, basketry, and 
                      other items clearly distinguish this collection from others 
                      known in the region. Although precious few of the artifacts 
                      have provenience information, much can still be learned 
                      through a comprehensive analysis of the collections that 
                      now reside in at least seven museum and research laboratories. 
                      With the exception of the seven  darts described in the <a href="hafted.html" target="_blank">Hafted Dart Point Analysis</a> section, none of the materials have been radiocarbon dated.   Until many more such analyses are conducted, the   story of Ceremonial Cave, as best as it can be reconstructed, will remain   untold.</p>
                  <p class="text">The artifacts shown here are housed at TARL 
                    and derive from collections by A.M. Woolsey (1936 investigation 
                    by UT Austin); E.B. Sayles and the Gila Pueblo Survey (which 
                    includes the original collection purchased by Eileen and Burrow 
                    Alves); and Tom O'Laughlin who recovered surface objects at 
                    the cave over a period of several decades. Other artifacts 
                    and records from Ceremonial Cave are curated in at least six 
                    other institutions or archeological laboratories, including 
                    the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution,
