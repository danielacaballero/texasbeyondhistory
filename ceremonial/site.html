				  <p class="text"> Ceremonial Cave stands out as one of the most 
                    unusual and interesting sites ever found in Texas, but its 
                    story is surely one of the most tragic examples of archeological 
                    site destruction in the state. On seeing the cave in the late 
                    1920s, area resident Eileen Alves lamented: &quot;Treasure 
                    hunters of the most malignant and energetic type have reduced 
                    the interior to a state of chaos.&quot; Fortunately, Alves 
                    and her husband Burrow Alves purchased some of the looters' 
                    collection, saving it from dispersal and ultimate destruction, 
                    for it is only as a group that the objects begin to convey 
                    their full significance. And fortunately, their alert to the 
                    archeological community prompted an investigation of the site 
                    before it was destroyed.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1928, the Alves invited archeologists C.B. 
                    and H.S. Cosgrove to explore the site. At that time many museums 
                    across the country were conducting fieldwork with the intent 
                    of adding to their collection exhibits. Representing Harvard's 
                    Peabody Museum, the Cosgroves were working nearby in the Mimbres 
                    area of southwestern New Mexico, exploring Pueblo ruins and 
                    what they believed to be the cultural remains of the earlier 
                    Basketmaker culture. The dry caves of the Hueco Mountains 
                    presented the possibility of finding perishable materials 
                    of similar cultural affiliation-basketry, clothing, and other 
                    items not commonly preserved in unsheltered sites.</p>
                  <p class="text">The report of explorations by C.B. Cosgrove 
                    published in 1947 provides us the bulk of the limited documentation 
                    that exists of the deposits at Ceremonial Cave. Because the 
                    deposits were already severely disturbed at the time of their 
                    investigations, it is likely we will never have a better understanding 
                    of the cave than what they observed. From their exploration, 
                    we learn of the remarkable objects found in the cave, but 
                    we also puzzle along with Cosgrove at the combination of certain 
                    artifacts and what their significance might be. There is an 
                    astonishing and diverse group of objects that are probably 
                    offerings, along with hundreds of fiber sandals, some embedded 
                    with cactus thorns. There was a puzzling layer of grass on 
                    the floor of the cave. There were the skeletons of a woman 
                    and a child, carefully placed in a cave niche. And throughout 
                    the cave deposits, in the same chamber containing ceremonial 
                    offerings, were quantities of desiccated human excrement.</p>
                  <p class="text">Cosgroves' 1928 map of the cave shows the main 
                    chamber as well as drifts, or extensions, as they appeared 
                    at the time, and denotes the area near the mouth of the cave 
                    where a great many ceremonial objects were found. Unfortunately, 
                    there is little documentation of the ceremonial deposit, although 
                    Cosgrove specifically mentions prayer sticks or ceremonial 
                    staffs (yucca stalks with attached fiber bolls), darts, and 
                    so-called hair ornaments. Given the nature of the early looting, 
                    it is likely that the ornaments and tablitas and certain other 
                    items purchased by the Alves were from the ceremonial deposits 
                    as well. Although a number of dart shafts were found in the 
                    rear portion of the main chamber, it is possible those were 
                    carried to the back by rodents; indeed, several shafts show 
                    signs of gnawing</p>
                  <p class="text">In addition to the remarkable array of artifacts, 
                    the Cosgroves found the skeletal remains of two individuals, 
                    a young child about 2 &frac12;-years old, and a young woman. 
                    Although their bones had been scattered by animals, it was 
                    evident that the woman had been placed in a bay on the side 
                    of the cave, her legs drawn up, and head facing south. She 
                    had been adorned with jewelry-&#151;a shell pendant and a 
                    necklace of seeds-&#151;but there were chipped stone projectile 
                    points within her body as well, one in her pelvic cavity and 
                    another on the right side of her body. Whether these attest 
                    to her violent death&#151;or were placed there for some other, 
                    more-peaceful reason&#151;is not known. We do know, however, 
                    that at her death she was carefully wrapped in a blanket of 
                    rabbit skin strips. Cosgrove believed the blanket was an early 
                    type, associated with the so-called Basketmaker culture.</p>
                  <p class="text">Cosgrove's interpretation of the cave deposits 
                    and the placement of artifacts is important. He notes the 
                    absence of fire pits or ash strata that would indicate it 
                    might have been used as a dwelling or that might indicate 
                    it was occupied for an extended period of time. One enigmatic 
                    feature&#151;a layer of packed grass lying directly on the 
                    cave floor and burned to ash in some places&#151;indicates 
                    a stay of some sort. Cosgrove believed it was bedding for 
                    transient visitors, and its burned state an indication that 
                    it was carelessly fired. </p>
                  <p class="text">Another curious finding was an enormous quantity 
                    of desiccated human excrement, or coprolites, throughout the 
                    cave. Unfortunately Cosgrove and subsequent investigators 
                    failed to collect any of the coprolites, which could have 
                    provided valuable information on the diet of the cave visitors 
                    as well as age of the deposits. </p>
                  <p class="text">In his report, Cosgrove sums up his interpretations: 
                    &quot;A shrine it appears to be, with a suggested curious 
                    custom of the purging of the bowels and leaving of worn-out 
                    sandals when the objects were deposited there as offerings.&quot; 
                    However, some investigators today hold a different interpretation: 
                    that is, both the coprolites and the large numbers of sandals 
                    may be attributable to earlier occupations at the site. Given 
                    that almost all of the cave was dug up, the large quantities 
                    of these items are more likely a function of large-scale sampling.</p>
                  <p class="text">Several other investigators visited and, in 
                    some cases, conducted excavations at Ceremonial Cave, adding 
                    a number of artifacts to the collections and raising additional questions about the deposits. Among these was E.B. Sayles, who in 1931 visited 
                    the cave and conducted limited testing in the rear of the 
                    main chamber. He reported what he termed a &quot;grass mat&quot; 
                    as well as a concentration of charcoal and ashes, yucca-leaf 
                    sandals, cordage, bone awls, and the bone of an extinct antelope 
                    dating to the late Pleistocene. (Bones of other extinct animals 
                    were also found by the Cosgroves and probably reflect use 
                    of the cave by Pleistocene animals.)</p>
                  <p class="text">Today, Ceremonial Cave is encompassed within 
                    the bounds of Fort Bliss. When archeologists from The University 
                    of Texas at El Paso surveyed the area and its caves for the 
                    United States Army Air Defense Artillery Center in 1997, they 
                    noted that there was almost nothing left in the cave. For a more detailed summary of investigations at Ceremonial 
                    Cave, download a <a href="images/Ceremonial-Cave-Article.pdf" class="text" target="_blank">pdf
