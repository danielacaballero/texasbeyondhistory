				  <p class="text"> Ceremonial Cave has long been regarded as one of the  earliest examples of Southwestern shrine caves, its greater age being indicated  by the quantities of items such as the darts and spears, so-called prayer sticks, and  fending sticks, all of which are generally older than the kinds of objects more  characteristic of later shrine caves. One of the few other comparably early  shrine caves is the Correo Snake Pit, a Laguna Pueblo war shrine in central New  Mexico. In contrast, the well known Mule Creek Cave in southwestern New Mexico  is a good example of a Late Prehistoric shrine cave; it contained large numbers of  bows and arrows, many of them in miniature, as well as pahos (prayer sticks), reed  cigarettes, tablitas, figurines, and even  mobiles.&nbsp; In many cases, shrine caves also have  pictographs.&nbsp; The presence of some of  these later kinds of objects at Ceremonial Cave indicates that this site  continued to be used a shrine cave until very late in the prehistoric period.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>There were several residential villages nearby in the Hueco  bolson at all times during the use of Ceremonial Cave as a shrine, at least to  the extent that it has been dated so far.&nbsp;  Late in time, there was the village at Hueco Tanks and, during the Pueblo  Period, there was the large Hot Well pueblo only a few miles away.&nbsp; One could presume that small contingents  of pilgrims visited Ceremonial Cave and perhaps other nearby places like Picture Cave for  religious rituals on many occasions over more than a millennium.&nbsp; If the fiber sandals so abundant at  Ceremonial Cave relate to use of the cave as a shrine, the astonishing number  of more than 1000 suggests many visits, apparently all or most by local  individuals, if the distinctive Hueco scuffer-toe style of sandal is any  indication. </p>
                  <p>Many of the  objects from Ceremonial Cave  reflect a distinctive Jornada Mogollon use of the shrine.&nbsp; The tablitas seem Jornada, but many of the  other objects such as the turquoise encrusted bracelet, the <em>Glycymeris</em> bracelets, the shell beads,  and the turquoise and shell pendants occur widely in the Southwest.&nbsp; The vermetid beads, however, come into the  Jornada area after the establishment of Casas Grandes as a major center in  northern Chihuahua southwest of modern El Paso.&nbsp;&nbsp; The iconography in the rock art in  nearby Picture Cave shows linkage to the greater Jornada-Mimbres-Casas Grandes  area in such features as the forward-pointing horn on the horned serpent  pictographs. </p>
                  <p><strong>Methodological  Benefits</strong></p>
                  <p>The CT scanning and AMS dating effort on the hafted spear  points has provided direct information on particular point styles that  delineates their chronological age range with greater precision and confidence  than was hitherto possible.&nbsp; The dates on  the three hafted Carlsbad points are relatively consistent at 2350-1730 B.P. or  400 B.C.-A.D. 220 (2 sigma calibration).&nbsp;  This is consistent with previous age estimates of ca 1000 B.C.-A.D. 300 but  is considerably tighter.&nbsp; Having dated  either the foreshafts or sinew binding, this new dating can be assumed to  reflect more accurately the true time period when the Carlsbad type was in use.</p>
                  <p>The single date so far on what is tentatively identified as  a Hueco point is 3640-3480 B.P. or 1690-1530 B.C. (2 sigma calibration).&nbsp; If the point has been correctly typed, this  date is several centuries earlier than what is generally thought for the Hueco  type.</p>
                  <p><strong>Dating the Use of  Ceremonial Cave as a Shrine<a name="_GoBack"></a></strong></p>
                  <p>One of the most obvious revelations of the CT scanning and  AMS dating of the hafted spear points is that some of the items apparently  placed in Ceremonial Cave as offerings are approximately 2000 years old whereas  others are at least another 1000 years older.&nbsp;  While it was clear from the basic atlatl/spear technology that many of  the artifacts predate the introduction of the bow and arrow sometime around A.D.  800, there was no chronometric evidence for more specific dating of the use of  Ceremonial Cave as a shrine until this project.&nbsp;  A similar dating effort by Phil Geib targeting the large number of  rabbit or fending sticks from Ceremonial Cave is in progress as is research by  Geo-Marine, Inc,. on dating of the tablitas and other ritual objects as they  relate more specifically the inception and fluoresence of Jornada style rock  art.&nbsp; Even with the very modest number of  AMS dates so far, it is abundantly clear that much can be learned about the  history of Ceremonial Cave via a program of AMS dating of the large collection  of artifacts with organic components.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>Clearly, some of the unusual objects from Ceremonial Cave  are substantially more recent in age than any of the spears and some can be  confidently dated on stylistic grounds to around A.D. 1000, give or take a couple  of centuries, and even to perhaps the A.D. 1400s.&nbsp;  This includes the well known turquoise encrusted bracelet, much of the  shell ornaments assemblage, in particular the Vermetid beads that likely came  via Casas Grandes in Chihuahua.&nbsp; At  present, we do not know if Ceremonial Cave was used as a shrine cave regularly  in the intervening centuries, but an aggressive AMS dating program would likely  determine this.&nbsp; In any event, we can say  with some confidence that Ceremonial Cave was one of the earliest shrine caves  anywhere in the greater Southwest. </p>
