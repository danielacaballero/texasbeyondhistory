                  <br>
                  <p>For at least a thousand years, a narrow canyon  in the Hueco Mountains near El Paso sheltered one of the earliest known shrine  caves in the greater American Southwest, a site that has come to be known as  Ceremonial Cave. Although many such caves have been found in Arizona and New  Mexico, Ceremonial Cave is notable for its unusually early use as a shrine, as  well as for its location in Texas, near the eastern margin of the Puebloan interaction sphere. </p>
                  <p><br>
                  The significance of shrine caves is rooted in  ancient belief systems about human origins.&nbsp;  Modern Pueblo people believe that caves are important as places of  emergence and as portals to a watery underworld.&nbsp; Ancient puebloans used specially designated  caves for rituals associated with specific seasons and activities.&nbsp; Most had both summer and winter shrine caves,  where designated individuals would place offerings and perform other rituals.  Depending on the nature of the visit and season of the year, the rituals  performed in the caves typically involved use of prayer sticks (also known as  <em>pahos</em>) and other painted and ornamented objects.<br>
                    <br>
                    Offerings found at Ceremonial Cave indicate that it may be one of the earliest   in the Southwest to have been used as a shrine (another is Correo Snake Pit in   Central New Mexico).&nbsp; Their earlier use is indicated most notably by the   presence of spear, atlatl, and fending stick offerings.&nbsp; At Ceremonial Cave, we   now know that placing of spears as offerings began about 2000 years ago, if not   centuries earlier, and continued for at least a millenium. </p>
                  <p><br>
  During this long period of time, a number of  objects were placed there deliberately during ritual activities, their richness  and diversity as a group unparalleled in this region. Along with ornaments of  turquoise, shell, and obsidian, prayer sticks, and spears were more puzzling  items and deposits. Some of these may be the day-to-day trappings and debris  left behind by much earlier peoples who visited and perhaps stayed briefly in  the cave. These visits&mdash;long before the cave's more specialized use&mdash;probably  spanned thousands of years.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    Much of what we know of the site we call Ceremonial Cave harks  back to accounts from the 1920s and 1930s, with our best source of information  being the investigations by the Harvard University research team led by C.B.  and H. S. Cosgrove. Beyond that and the few other descriptions left us, the  story of Ceremonial Cave is told largely, but very imperfectly, by the  artifacts collected through the years by looters and archeologists alike.</p>
                  <h3 class="text"><strong>New Research </strong></h3>
                  <p class="text">Recent studies of artifacts curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and the Peabody Museum at Harvard University are helping to unlock some of the secrets of  Ceremonial Cave nearly a century after its excavation. Analytical techniques, such as AMS dating and high resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning, now afford researchers the opportunity to examine some of the rare and perishable items with minimal damage to the objects. These materials &#8212;cane and wood spear shafts, foreshafts, and &quot;pajo&quot; or prayer sticks&#8212;constitute one of the largest  collections of such objects from the Southwest. Rarely found intact, the hafted darts and &quot;prayer sticks,&quot; in particular, hold promise for helping us better understand the technology and ritual traditions  of the desert cultures.</p>
                  <p class="text">AMS radiocarbon dating of hafting  on several of the darts reinforces  indications that the offerings were left by peoples of the Jornada-Mogollon culture. CT scans  of the hafted darts provide a clear image of each chipped-stone point and allow researchers to determine their shape and style and even examine aspects of hafting technology. The   combination of projectile point form and chronometric age helps fine tune the dating of specific projectile point styles in the   American Southwest and  approximate a timeline for some of the events which took place there. </p>
                  <h3 class="text"><strong>In This Exhibit</strong></h3>
                  <p class="text">In the following sections we take a closer look at what is known about Ceremonial Cave.  <a href="site.html" target="_blank"> Site Discovery</a> traces the efforts of an  El Paso area couple to have the site  documented, excavated, and protected from relic collectors who had already destroyed much of the cave's deposits. <a href="gallery.html" target="_blank">Artifact Gallery</a> provides examples of the hundreds of artifacts recovered from the site and considers the meaning, both sacred and mundane, of these diverse items. <a href="hafted.html" target="_blank">Hafted Dart Points </a>reports on  recent analyses  of the  remarkably preserved weapons including CT scans and radiocarbon dating.   In this interactive section, viewers can study the objects  through  a series of rotating &ldquo;movies&rdquo; with 3-dimensional details generated for each dart point. These include complete views of the dart point basal sections hidden beneath the hafting materials. </p>
