<h1>Deer Hunting </h1>

<p>Deer were the main animal hunted by native peoples of the lower Bosque area.
Deer not only provided lean meat, but the marrow inside the bones was an
important source of fat and protein. The fat was later mixed with dried meat and other foods to
make  food  that could be preserved and carried on hunting trips and
from camp to camp. In addition to food, skins from the animal were tanned and used to make clothing, moccasins,
blankets, and coverings for temporary shelters. Bone and antler could be fashioned into tools.  </p>
<p>For all these reasons, deer were a highly-ranked resource in prehistoric times and the primary target of hunters in the
lower Bosque River valley. At the three excavated sites, archeologists found  large quantities of deer bone, much of which had been broken and crushed. These heavily fragmented remains tell
archeologists that the prehistoric campers were  utilizing the deer intensely for food, breaking up the  bones and boiling them to get the
fat or bone grease. </p>
<p>Deer provided the bulk of the calories and animal
  protein consumed by the occupants of the Britton and McMillan sites (mussels
  provided the bulk of the calories and animal protein at Higginbotham).  Based on identifiable elements, at least seven deer are represented in the assemblages at the
  Britton site (two in AU 1, four in AU 2, and one in AU 3). At least six deer
  are present in the assemblages at the McMillan site (one in AU 1, two in AU 2,
  and three in AU 3), and at least two deer (one adult and one juvenile) are
  represented at the Higginbotham site. The importance of deer as a resource to
  the prehistoric groups of the lower Bosque River valley is examined further
  below in the context of potential population densities and the nutritional
  value of deer.</p>
<h2>Favored Habitats </h2>
<p>Deer prefer woodlands and other vegetation communities that provide cover
  and nutritional browse (leaves and young twigs of woody plants), forbs, and
  mast&mdash;a diet composition that fluctuates throughout the year, depending on
  plant availability and rainfall. Their favored habitat consists of a patchwork of trees and
  shrubs interspersed with open areas. Deer generally avoid
  open grasslands, as they provide neither adequate cover nor a dependable source of food. Deer are not able
  to digest mature grasses, although they will consume grasses when they are
  young and succulent. In prehistoric
  times, many of the Grand Prairie&rsquo;s environments were grasslands or open
  live oak savannas and were largely maintained by wildfires, so prime deer
  habitat would have been limited to the riparian zones along streams. The loamy bottomlands
  of the lower Bosque basin&mdash;composed of an overstory of oaks, pecans, elms, hackberries,
  cottonwoods, and ashes and an understory of hawthorn, greenbrier, peppervine,
  and forbs&mdash;provide ideal habitat and cover for deer and an adequate diet
  of browse, mast, and forbs.</p>
<p>Across the Grand Prairie, modern estimates of carrying capacity range from
one deer per 10&ndash;12 acres on good habitat in the Cross Timbers area to as
little as one deer per 25&ndash;30 acres or greater in areas with less than
optimal habitat, based on Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) studies. To the east in the Post Oak Savannah, riparian
habitats along stream courses will support one deer per 10 acres. Although deer populations today are probably higher than they were
prehistorically due to a lack of natural predators and an expansion of brushy
cover due to the suppression of wildfires, a carrying capacity of one deer per
10 acres is probably appropriate for the stream valleys and riparian zones of
the lower Bosque basin in prehistory, given the similar environmental
parameters of both areas&rsquo; riparian zones. Riparian areas of the lower
Bosque basin cover ca. 23,490 hectares (58,000 acres) or 235 km<sup>2</sup>. <strong>With a
carrying capacity of one deer for every 10 acres, the lower Bosque basin could
have supported a local population of perhaps 5,800 deer.</strong></p>

<p>Deer are not only an important  source of food but also a source of hides for clothing.
Regional ethnographic and historical accounts of Native American dress range
from nothing or very little being worn to the use of breech
or loincloths, buckskin or bison hide moccasins, leggings, and robes as the
weather dictated among Tonkawa men. Tonkawa women wore
minimal clothing, usually consisting of a short skin skirt. Assuming the prehistoric groups of the lower Bosque basin wore, at minimum, loincloths or skirts, moccasins, and heavier robes or   capes as needed, no more   than two deer hides would have been needed to outfit an individual. Assuming also that these
hide garments lasted on average no more than one year (moccasins much less)
given the regional climatic regime, two hides per person would have been needed annually.</p>
<h2>How Many Deer Did It Take? </h2>
<p>To outfit the  214 people we have estimated lived in the lower Bosque River Basin (see <a href="population.html">Population Assumptions</a>) would require harvesting at least
  428 deer a year. This is a cull rate of just over 7 percent&mdash;a rate that
  compares favorably with an average modern (1974&ndash;1993) harvest rate (8
  percent per year) for the Post Oak Savannah, but well below
  the 30 percent needed to sustain a population at carrying capacity. Whatever the prehistoric cull rate was, it seemingly never exceeded 30
  percent throughout the late Holocene given the prevalence of deer remains at
  the sites.</p>
<p>According to USDA figures, raw venison yields 120 calories and contains 2.4 g of fat and 23 g of
protein per 100 g of meat. Daily protein
requirements to support an individual average around 50 g, thus one would need
to consume about 217 g of lean venison to satisfy daily protein needs. An adult
white-tailed deer in the fall on average provides about 18 kg of lean meat,
representing about half of the animal&rsquo;s field-dressed weight. This
TPWD estimate is based on average buck and doe weights by year-class for
field-dressed deer harvested in the Post Oak Savannah during the 1989&ndash;90
hunting season. The projected 18 kg/deer of venison
would supply 83 person-days of protein. For our 214 people, the 428 deer needed to
supply an adequate number of hides for clothing would provide enough protein
for 166 days. This amount of protein, however, does not include nutrients that
are available from bone marrow and grease, the use of which would provide
additional person-days of protein. For our minimal group of 18 to 20 people 18
kg of venison (one deer) would sustain them for 4&ndash;5 days.</p>

<p>If we more than double the cull rate to 15 percent per year (note that this
is still half the sustainable rate), our hunters and gatherers would annually
harvest 870 deer. At this rate, they would have exceeded their annual need for
clothing and nearly meet their daily protein requirements for a year from meat
alone. In this scenario, they would have produced a surplus of deer hides, and
possibly a surplus of venison if protein and other nutrients from bone marrow
and grease are factored into the equation. Based on these scenarios, we
disagree with the assumption of theorists such as Lewis Binford and others who have suggested that bone grease production is a high-cost
strategy employed during times of starvation or resource scarcity. In light of the protein and nutrient yields of
deer hunting in the lower Bosque basin, we believe that grease production was a
low-cost endeavor (the high cost of carcass acquisition was paid for by meat
and marrow yields) and represents an efficient use of the animal that delayed
costly moves to the next resource patch.</p>
