      <h3><strong>Research Approaches</strong> and Models </h3>
      <p>On a site-by-site basis,  the Waco Lake investigations focused on what types of activities took place,  what resources were used, what kinds of technologies were employed, and, if  possible, the time of year the sites were occupied. There is, however, more to  this analysis than just providing a list of activities and traits or  descriptions of the tools and resources used.&nbsp;  Organized and examined within a theoretical framework, site activities  and the resources and technologies used can provide a clearer picture of  prehistoric hunter-gatherer behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;In  the section below, we examine some of the research approaches used to link the  archeological record&#8212;the artifacts, features, and traces in the dirt&#8212;with human behavior in the past. Many of these assumptions and theories are based on ethnographic studies of modern-day hunting and gathering groups as well as historical accounts by early North American explorers who witnessed native Americans living in traditional ways. For students of archeology as well as the public in general, this discussion provides a brief compendium of some of the key studies and ideas by leading theorists  in hunter-gatherer archeology.

        <strong>Hunter-Gatherer Behavior and the Environment </strong></p>
      <p><br>
        Hunter-gatherer characteristics and behaviors  such as mobility, subsistence, social group composition and dynamics, and land  tenure vary across time and space. &nbsp;In  ethnographic, ethnoarcheological, and archeological literature, the relationship  between the environment and hunter-gatherer behaviors and decision making is  modeled through the examination of many types of environmental and resource  variables. </p>
      <p>One particular model by Rada  Dyson-Hudson and Eric Alden Smith focuses on the density and predictability  of resources and how hunters and gatherers might respond to these variables.  As shown in the image above, the model is divided into four predicted  hunter-gatherer responses based on the nature of the resources. The model  assumes that, when resource density and predictability are low, hunter-gatherer  groups will be highly dispersed and mobile across the landscape within  territories that are loosely defined and not defended. Where resource  predictability is low and density is high, it is expected that hunters and  gatherers will be highly mobile but conducive to information-sharing with other  groups. In areas of low resource density and high predictability, passively  defended territories will develop, but population densities would be low, with  groups tending to stay in one area of predictable resources. High resource  density and dependability predicts geographically stable territories within  which the movement of groups would be restricted and the territory and  resources strongly defended. Of course, environmental reality cannot always be  easily shoehorned into neat categories, because environments are dynamic. The Grand Prairie environment  is no different, but the best characterization of this region may be one of low  resource predictability and shifting resource densities.</p>
      <p>In many environments, there is a high  correspondence between seasonal changes and resource predictability<strong>.</strong> Regular or expected seasonal temperature  fluctuations impose a sense of predictability for resource availability and  scheduling. In the Grand Prairie,  however, the links between seasonal change and resource predictability  seemingly are weak or nonexistent for a couple of reasons. One is the lack of a  lengthy cold or winter season. Though seasonal temperature variation is high,  with the daily average difference between January and July being 22.7&deg; C (40.9&deg; F), an average year  only has 32 days with below-freezing temperatures and a growing season of 253  days. &nbsp;Periods of freezing temperatures  are usually short-lived, and overnight freezing temperatures often give way to  sunny and warm daytime conditions during the winter months. The lack of snow  cover and frozen ground would make certain roots, tubers, and bulbs available  year-round, rather than being limited to warmer spring and summer months, as  they are in northern temperate climates. The lack of snow cover and relatively  warm temperatures also provide access to adequate forage for animals and  eliminates the need for migration or hibernation for most warm-blooded species.  Even cold-blooded reptilian species such as turtles can be observed out and  about on warm, sunny days during the winter months.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Another  reason for the low resource predictability in the Grand Prairie is the lack of  large topographic features that would host vastly different ecosystems with  distinct sets of resources due to differences in elevation&mdash;sets of resources  that would be available at different times of the year. It is clear that the availability of many resources is not predicated  on seasonal changes or distinct ecological zones of different elevations. Many  resources are readily available throughout the year, therefore subsistence  activities might not vary much throughout the year. That is not to say the  region lacks seasonally available resources, but even the densities of these  can vary in unpredictable fashions (this is discussed in more detail below). In  fact, the densities of most resources in the region can vary throughout the  year and from year to year.</p>
      <p>The region&rsquo;s proximity to the semiarid plains  and arid deserts to the west and the more humid woodlands and forests to the  east makes it particularly vulnerable to oscillating, yet relatively  unpredictable, periods of rainfall deficits and surpluses. The annual rainfall  pattern, while bimodal with late spring and early fall peaks, is often  interrupted by prolonged droughts or short periods of torrential rains that can  occur at any time of the year. The Balcones Escarpment to the south and  southwest is one the most flash flood&ndash;prone regions in the United States.  Chaotic rainfall patterns can deliver paralyzing blows or setbacks to many  resources, affecting their density and availability. As rainfall patterns  become less regular, uncertainty regarding resources and on how foragers must  deal with them increases.</p>
      <p>Even seasonally available resources such as nut  crops (e.g., pecans, walnuts, and acorns), prickly pear fruits, and mesquite  beans, which by being seasonally available are generally predictable, can  nonetheless vary in production from year to year due to rainfall amounts and  distribution. For example, in south Texas,  prickly pear tuna and mesquite bean production have been found to vary  considerably from year to year due to rainfall amounts during the pre-flowering  and flowering periods. Acorn production is highly variable from year to year,  even among trees of the same species. Oaks produce low to moderate acorn crops  in most years, with abundant yields once every two to five years. Abundant crop  yields may be 80 percent higher than those in a low-production year, varying by  hundreds of pounds of acorns per acre. This natural cycle of production can be  confounded by factors such as erratic rainfall. Poor acorn production can  result from extended periods of rain or high humidity during the flowering  period, which reduces the tree&rsquo;s ability to pollinate. Poor acorn production  would directly impact hunter-gatherer food supplies, as well as have a  devastating effect on deer populations. Annual pecan production is similarly  cyclical. Pecan groves do not naturally produce abundant crops every year, but  in fact do so every two to four years.</p>
      <p>So even those resources that are truly seasonal  can be unpredictable in terms of their yields due to natural cycles of  production and climatic factors. In short, the density of resources can remain  stable, or can vary from high to low and in a largely unpredictable fashion.  Given these characteristics of resource density and predictability,  Dyson-Hudson and Smith&rsquo;s model predicts that hunter-gatherer groups in the  study area would be highly mobile and, depending on the resource density,  highly dispersed within ill-defined territories that are not defended. Another  scenario is that they would be conducive to information-sharing within  territories that shift due to unpredictable but dense resources.</p>
      <p>There is one last factor that we need to  consider before examining the linkages between behavior and the archeological  record: the<strong> cost of acquiring the  resources.</strong> Central Texas and adjacent  regions often have been described in bountiful terms by researchers who provide  extensive lists of available food resources, but what has not been addressed is  the cost of obtaining these resources. Hence, the Dyson-Hudson and Smith model  is coupled here with <strong>optimal foraging  theory</strong>. Optimal foraging theory is centered on the idea that to forage  optimally is to be efficient relative to time or energy costs (see Robert  Bettinger 1991 and Bruce Winterhalder 1981). As noted by J. R. Krebs,  it can be thought of as a set of &ldquo;decision rules for predators.&rdquo; Optimal  foraging theory is derived from evolutionary ecology&mdash;a neo-Darwinian approach  that focuses on the interaction of natural selection and ecological variables  in the development of a biological organism&rsquo;s adaptations (for overviews, see G.  A, Parker and John Maynard-Smith 1990, and Eric Pianka 1978). Widely used in  the biological sciences, evolutionary ecology assumes that natural selection  has influenced organisms to behave in ways that enhance fitness, or in terms of  hunters and gatherers, cognitive decisions regarding foraging strategies are  shaped by &ldquo;natural selection.&rdquo; Simply put, favorable decisions or efficient  behaviors promote fitness and survival, and it is this basis that supports  predictive modeling. </p>
      <p><u>Optimal foraging models predict that selection  will favor the best strategy from among a defined set of strategies that are  possible in the environmental context of interest </u>. Optimal foraging  models can deal with a variety of relationships centered on foraging strategies  and diet and produce hypotheses that can be tested. One of the more common  models, the <strong>diet breadth</strong> model (see  Bettinger 1991;&nbsp;Robert L. Kelly 1995), is based on  the concept of ranking resources based on the returns or benefits provided by  the resource relative to the cost of acquiring and processing the resource.  Some of the predictions the model makes include: (1) the optimal diet will  become specialized if <strong>high-ranked</strong> resources become abundant and acquisition costs decline; and (2) lower-ranked  resources may be added to the diet if higher-ranked resources decline and their  acquisition cost increases. Another model, the <strong>patch choice model</strong> predicts that hunters and gatherers will abandon  an area before resources are depleted, since the cost of obtaining dwindling  resources is high (see, for example, Karl Butzer 1982; Kelly 1995; Winterhalder  1981). Optimization models also can be applied to hunter-gatherer  technologies. Such a model might look at the relationship between the  portability versus the durability and versatility of tools (e.g., Steven Kuhn  1994), predicting that the <strong>optimal tool  design</strong> is one that has the greatest potential utility relative to the cost  of transporting it.</p>
      <p>These models do not replicate reality, nor do  they assume that hunters and gatherers will always behave in the most efficient  way possible. They do assume, however, that behaviors will tend toward a  maximization of efficiency. Optimization models predict an optimal pattern of  behavior (or an optimal tool design) that is influenced by selective pressures  and that can be tested or compared against those patterns observed in the  archeological record, as Kelly has noted. It is the explanatory and predictive  powers of optimal foraging theory that make it useful. Scholars can use it to  predict how hunters and gatherers might cope with a shifting (in terms of  density) and unpredictable resource base and other challenges, and it is these  coping mechanisms, or risk-reduction strategies, that can be tested against the  archeological record.</p>
      <p>Dynamic and unpredictable resources and the cost  of obtaining these resources are dealt with through the employment of<strong> risk-reduction strategies</strong>. Basically,  all hunting and gathering societies tend to work to reduce risks or avoid  production shortfalls through various technological, social, and cultural  mechanisms. Risk-reduction strategies such as group mobility may involve moving a foraging group to a new  resource patch when the cost of obtaining resources relative to the benefit  increases in the current location. When faced with shortages, a foraging group  (or at least some members of the foraging group) might also take advantage of kin or economic ties with neighboring  groups that may be experiencing a windfall. Or if experiencing a windfall of  their own, the foraging group may invite others to cohabit and share resources  to assure reciprocal actions or access to resources in the future. Regardless  of the strategy employed, risk-reduction strategies imply that the amount of  available food resources is ever changing relative to need or that food is  often scarce relative to demand. </p>
      <p>For the Bosque  River/Lake Waco  study area, the Dyson-Hudson and Smith model predicts risk-reduction strategies  of high mobility, fluid and undefended territorial boundaries, and information  sharing. In linking these risk-reduction strategies to the archeological  record, we collapse or translate the predicted behavior of high mobility into  two broad categories that the archeological record can address<strong>: duration of occupation</strong> and<strong> use intensity. </strong> Since the archeological record of Waco Lake  has a limited ability to address aspects of territoriality and information  sharing, these issues will not be formally addressed, but a few pieces of  tantalizing data will be discussed that provide some insights into these  issues. Duration of occupation and use intensity are broad in the sense that  they subsume a multitude of behaviors, including aspects of subsistence and  technology.</p>
      <p>Without question, aspects of length of  occupation and use intensity are interrelated, but they each make particular  marks on the archeological record, which are examined in greater detail below.  However, before we examine the archeological results of the risk-reduction  strategies, we should articulate some basic assumptions about hunters and  gatherers. These assumptions, which are primarily based on John Yellen&rsquo;s 1977  study of the !Kung but come from other ethnographic studies as well (eg., Kelly  1995), relate to the composition of hunter-gatherer groups, or bands, and the  structure or organization of their campsites. We assume that the most basic  socioeconomic unit comprising hunter-gather groups is the nuclear family, who  claim group or band membership through kinship or marriage but may also claim  membership within other groups and at times may cohabit with them as well.  Yellen&rsquo;s work with the !Kung revealed that nuclear families are fairly  unrestricted in their movements between groups. Over a four-year period, he  observed a turnover rate of 80&nbsp;percent in individuals of the Dobe band of  the !Kung at the group aggregation camp during the dry season. Families and  individuals move relatively freely about in a network of groups that has been  referred to as a marriage group. The marriage group is endogamous and provides  mates for most of its members. Groups within the marriage group, probably  through a small core of siblings or cousins, collectively hold, move about in,  and exploit a territory, which is not defended or is passively defended. The  size of this territory is fluid, due largely to the comings and goings of  individuals and nuclear families, but it is known by all within the marriage  group that the core of the territory (e.g., a perennial waterhole in the  Kalahari) is held by a particular sibling-cousin group.</p>
      <p>We also assume that hunter-gatherer campsites at  a basic social level can be divided into private and communal areas, with the  private areas essentially representing individual nuclear families. Private  areas are seen as containing the family hearth and shelter, and it is the idea  of a family hearth area that is of particular importance to the current  investigations. Many camp activities are centered around hearths. For the  !Kung, most manufacturing and cooking activities take place near the family  hearth. Marc Stevenson (1991) has noted that exterior hearths are  frequently the loci of social life and activities in hunting and gathering  societies, particularly in temperate and warm climates. Prehistorically,  patterns of individual family hearths, and hence family activity areas, are  interpreted for sites throughout central Texas  (see LeRoy Johnson 1994) and the Plains (eg., Michael Quigg 1983),  although this pattern clearly is not unique to these areas.</p>
      <p><strong>Group Mobility, Duration  of Occupation, Use Intensity, and the Archeological Record</a> </strong><br>
        The topic of mobility among hunters and  gatherers has received a lot of attention in the recent anthropological,  ethnoarcheological, and archeological literature. Lewis Binford  (1980) discusses hunter-gatherer mobility in terms of a continuum from highly  mobile foragers to less mobile logistical collectors, depending on how they  acquire resources and the nature of their environment. Not unlike Binford&rsquo;s  forager-collector model is Bettinger&rsquo;s (1991) traveler-processor model,  which takes a more in-depth look at the relationships between population,  resources, settlement, and subsistence via optimal foraging theory. Kelly (1983)  notes five dimensions of mobility in his study: (1)&nbsp;number of residential  moves per year, (2)&nbsp;average distance moved, (3)&nbsp;total distance moved  each year, (4)&nbsp;total area used over a course of a year, and (5) the  average length of a logistical foray. Like the density and predictability of  resources, these dimensions of mobility can vary from year to year, and from  circumstance to circumstance. Identifying and examining these components from  the standpoint of a static archeological record can be particularly  challenging, if not impossible. Fortunately, though, mobility influences the  material culture of hunters and gatherers, affecting what material remains  enter the archeological record and how they enter it. Tools, weapons, shelters  that provide protection from the elements, personal adornment items, and  features for cooking, processing, and storage all have to adhere to the demands  of mobility. These are tangible pieces of evidence that can be examined by  archeologists and that allow inferences about the relative length of  occupations, whether movements between sites were short or long distances, and  how material culture meets the demands of mobility. Tied to these issues of  mobility are length of occupation and use intensity, which alludes to how a  site is used, what resources are used, and what technologies are employed while  a site is occupied before it is ultimately abandoned.</p>
      <p>Several pieces of archeological data can provide  insights into the relative length of an occupation of a site, or use intensity,  and by inference determine how mobile groups were. One can look at the kinds of  resources used and the costs of obtaining those resources. Archeological sites  across the central Texas  region, particularly during the Archaic period, display a strikingly consistent  and similar suite of material remains, with deer remains and burned rock  features being two notable examples. Deer are considered a high-ranked  resource, providing many calories from meat and marrow, making search, capture,  and processing costs relatively low. Burned rock features, particularly  basin-shaped hearths and pits, are considered geophyte-processing features  based on the recovery of various bulbs, roots, and tubers from feature contexts  across the region. Although it is unlikely that these hot rock  cooking features were used exclusively for baking geophytes, it is assumed that  this was their foremost function, since many geophytes require prolonged periods  of cooking to render them edible and palatable. The gathering and processing of  geophytes can be viewed as tedious and time-consuming, especially considering  the popular notion that plants are low yield&ndash;high cost foods (e.g., Kelly  1995:90). However, these gathering and processing costs can be driven down if  the processing features and campsite are adjacent to dense patches of  geophytes. The fact that geophytes are stationary resources also helps keep  acquisition costs down. Deer and geophytes provide a good balance of calories  from proteins, fats, and carbohydrates at relatively low cost, so it is  reasonable to think of them as resources that are highly ranked and largely  available year-round, but susceptible to erratic droughts and floods that  affect their densities. These two resources probably were the initial targets  of acquisition for hunters and gatherers once a campsite was chosen or resource  patch entered. This action resulted in a widespread archeological pattern  throughout central Texas;  however, it is not to say that lower-ranked resrouces would not be initially  taken if the opportunity presented itself.</p>
      <p>With few exceptions, resources other than deer  and geophytes can be considered lower-ranked resources, and their presence in  archeological assemblages would suggest longer occupations. Use of lower-ranked  resources would suggest that deer and geophytes were dwindling to the point  that the cost of their acquisition was rising. These lower-ranked resources  usually consist of small-bodied vertebrates, such as reptiles (e.g., turtles  and snakes) and small mammals (e.g., rodents and rabbits) and invertebrates  such as mussels. Such creatures were probably trapped, snared, or simply hand  collected, rather than hunted. With the dwindling returns and increased costs  of geophytes, the acquisition of these lower-ranked resources may have fallen  upon the women (or older children) of the group, since men would have continued  to hunt high-return large game such as deer, even if it meant traveling greater  distances. This notion is also consistent with the  ethnographic literature, which is replete with examples of women trapping and  collecting small animals.  The duration of the occupation can be extended through the use of lower-ranked  resources&mdash;a phenomenon that should be evident in the archeological record. The  number and variety of lower-ranked faunal remains in terms of Number of  Identified Specimens (NISP)&mdash;and the ratios of lower-ranked fauna to deer or  other artiodactyls&mdash;should provide insight into whether sites supported  short-term occupations.</p>
      <p>Firewood was another vital resource for the  hunter-gatherer groups of the North   Bosque River  valley, and the taxa of the downed limb wood collected and used for campfires  can be indicative of the duration of a site&rsquo;s occupation. The species of downed  limb wood collected for campfires at the Britton, McMillan, and Higginbotham sites  should reflect the arboreal species comprising the North   Bosque riparian zone, if the length of stay was relatively short.  Longer stays at a camp location may deplete firewood sources in the immediate  camp area, driving up the costs of collecting firewood as greater distances  from camp are traveled to collect it. The use of firewood from species not  present in the riparian zone (e.g., ashe juniper, mesquite, live oak) would  indicate lengthier stays as nearby riparian sources were depleted and travel  and collection costs for firewood outside the valley were lower than lengthy  trips up and down the valley&rsquo;s riparian zone to collect firewood.</p>
      <p>Obviously, occupants of campsites generate  waste materials, and longer occupations generate more debris, with all  other variables being equal. Refuse has  to be managed and living areas maintained to curtail interference with  subsequent activities. Yellen  notes that  long-term occupied camps of the !Kung are better organized largely through  waste management, which results in a greater number of dumps or secondary  refuse piles. Refuse clearing often produces secondary refuse dumps on the  peripheries of camps or intensively or repeatedly occupied activity areas  (see Stevenson 1991). In cleaning, smaller objects are often left behind, no  matter how thorough or often cleaning occurs, while larger objects get removed.  The result is that secondary refuse dumps should consist primarily of  larger-sized objects. The content and context of the materials can also aid in  determining whether a feature represents a secondary refuse dump. An examination  of the number, size, and location of secondary refuse dumps within the site can  then provide information on the duration of occupation. The distribution of  unmodified debitage size classes across a site can provide similar information.  Larger debitage should be concentrated away from activity areas if these areas  have been cleaned.</p>
      <p>With the onset of site abandonment, refuse  should no longer be subject to the same level of cleanup, size sorting, and  dispersal as during the earlier periods of occupation. Discarded  items, regardless of size, from activities that occur late in an occupation  should remain grouped around hearths, whereas large objects used and disposed  of earlier would be found in secondary refuse piles away from the hearth and  along the periphery of the camp. As previously noted,  lower-ranked resources should enter the camp in the later stages of occupation  if the occupation is relatively long. Remains of these lower-ranked resources,  therefore, should have a limited presence in secondary refuse piles and a more  dominant presence around the hearths. Deer remains, particularly larger-sized  elements, should be present in greater numbers than remains of low-ranked  resources in the secondary refuse dumps if the occupation is lengthy. This  assumption is not only consistent with optimal foraging theory but with  ethnographic data as well.</p>
      <p>Long-term occupations witness more activities, not necessarily in  terms of diversity but in terms of actual employment. The more times an  activity requiring tools is performed, the more wear and breakage of tools  occur. Even though many of these tools are part of a mobile tool kit and are  brought into sites with use wear and edges already resharpened, use-broken  tools and those with little or no remaining use life should be more common in  sites that were occupied longer, because tool use lives tend to exceed the  length of occupation at short-term sites. To further examine this assertion,  the ratio of unmodified debitage to finished formal chipped stone tools, which  provides a measure of the frequency of tool discard, can be calculated. Worn  and use-broken chipped stone tools have to be replaced, and unmodified debitage  is a meaningful byproduct of this action for determining the relative length of  occupation. The amount of unmodified debitage is a good measure of length of  occupation because, unlike other chipped stone artifacts (e.g., formal tools),  the removal of unmodified debitage far from its locus of production is less  probable. Burned densities also may provide information on use intensity.</p>
      <p>Yellen offers this obvious general  rule: the longer a site is occupied, the  greater the probability that any particular activity will occur there. Different activities may require different suites of tools and features, so  that not only would longer occupations result in a greater number of tools and  features but a greater diversity of tools and features. Assemblage diversity  can be measured in terms of richnessand  evenness. Richness indexes measure the number of classes or categories in a  sample or assemblage (Kaufman 1998). The more categories or classes present,  the richer it is. A richness index (<em>R&nbsp;=&nbsp;S</em>/&Ouml;<em>N</em>)  derived by Menhinick (1964) is used in this analysis. In this equation, greater  values of <em>R</em> indicate increasing  richness, <em>S</em> is the number of classes  or categories, and <em>N</em> represents the  total number of specimens within the assemblage. Another assemblage aspect,  evenness, describes the relative frequencies of specimens within each of the  classes or categories across the assemblage, or the degree to which all classes  or categories are equally represented. Unfortunately, many  measures of evenness have inherent problems that make them unreliable measures  of heterogeneity in most cases (Bobrowsky and Ball 1989). Due to these  limitations, Kaufman uses a measure relating to variance,  specifically the coefficient of variation (the standard deviation divided by  the mean number of specimens per class) of each assemblage, to describe  evenness. In this case, greater evenness is indicated by smaller values of the  coefficient of variation. The jackknife technique is then applied to the two  measures (richness and evenness) of diversity, because each measure is  dependent on sample or assemblage size. This technique involves repeatedly  recalculating the statistic of interest (richness or evenness), each time  eliminating one of the classes or categories. These calculations  produce a series of jackknife estimates, which are used to generate a set of  corresponding pseudovalues, the mean of which provides the best estimate for  the statistic of interest. The relationship between richness and evenness can  be examined in terms of site function, where general campsites are represented  by high richness and low evenness values and specialized activity sites are  represented by low richness and high evenness values. In this context, we  assume the former are represented by longer occupations.</p>
      <p><strong>If hunters  and gatherers&rsquo; knowledge of the environment tells them that resource density is  high in a particular area, they may anticipate lengthier stays at sites.</strong> This concept of  &ldquo;anticipated mobility&rdquo;&mdash;length of time people expect to occupy a site&mdash;was found  to be important among the San and Bantu peoples. Susan Kent&rsquo;s  (1991) study showed that anticipated mobility was more influential in  determining site structure and the number of m2 per person, a rough  index of site investment at a camp, than group size or how long the group  actually lived there. All the sites in Kent&rsquo;s  study with an  anticipated short length of occupation had a value of less than 33&nbsp;m2  per person. That works out to site sizes of 825 to 2,475 m2,  assuming groups or bands consist of 25&ndash;75 people as suggested by Jochim (1976)  and Kelly. Determining the number of m2 per person,  or even the size of the area used by site occupants during a single occupation  based on archeological data, is difficult at best, but there are other ways to  determine anticipated mobility using archeological information. Since  anticipated mobility also influences site structure, the anticipated duration  of occupation should be reflected in the proximity of individual households or  private family areas to each other. The closer the households, the shorter the  anticipated stay. Assuming that small hearth features represent individual  family hearths, the distances between hearths might provide insight into  whether a group anticipated a short or long stay. Probably more important, the  anticipated length of occupation might give us a better understanding of a  group&rsquo;s knowledge of their environment.</p>
      <p>On a side note, if, as implied earlier, close  proximity to dense patches of geophytes is a criteria for site selection, the  anticipated length of stay might be determined by those in the group who would  be most knowledgeable about how long the resource might sustain the group.  Since anticipated mobility affects the organization of the camp, many of the  decisions made regarding the layout of the camp were probably made by women.</p>
      <p>Distances  moved between campsites can vary greatly. Again this is a dimension of mobility  that cannot be measured in the archeological record, but insights into whether  movements were relatively short or lengthy might be possible based on tool  curation and the distance to stone sources. If opportunities to replace tools  are few, meaning immediate access to adequate sources of stone is limited due  to distance, tools should show evidence of intense reworking. However, if a  source of material is close by, tools may not display much evidence of intense  curation and resharpening. In the lower North Bosque   River valley in the  vicinity of the Britton, McMillan, and Higginbotham sites, small chert gravels can be  found on some of the gravel bars, but in limited numbers. Because of their  small size and limited numbers, they may have been exploited only for the  production of small expedient flake tools. The closest known sources of sizable  chert clasts and nodules to the four sites range from ca. 11.5 to 20.0&nbsp;km  away. Unless procurement of lithic raw materials is embedded in or part of the  daily foraging strategy, or the foraging radius  includes adequate sources of stone, groups (campsites) would have to move  closer to the source areas to obtain raw materials. Given the distance to the  known sources, a high degree of tool curation in the form of intense  resharpening and edge rejuvenation ought to reflect short moves between  campsites in the lower North   Bosque River  valley, since tool replacement opportunities would rarely, if at all, present  themselves. However, if tools do not display a high degree of tool curation, it  could reflect longer distances moved between camps&mdash;movements that would present  procurement and tool replacement opportunities. The ratio of formal tools, in  this case projectile points and bifaces, that exhibit resharpening to those  that do not may be indicative of the distances moved between campsites. The use  of a tool form that is highly durable, versatile, and amenable to edge  rejuvenation and promoting a high level of curation will negate the need for  frequent tool replacement and hence frequent trips to stone sources. This idea  is explored in greater detail below, but it would tend to support the notion of  short-distance movements in the chert-poor lower North Bosque   River valley since such  tools designs are often used in areas where sources of stone are limited (see Robert Kelly  and Lawrence Todd 1988).</p>
      <p><strong>Mobility  influences material culture in the sense that material possessions are few due  to the cost of transporting materials from site to site</strong>.<strong> </strong>Among the !Kung, most  of a nuclear family&rsquo;s possessions can be carried by a single adult. Transport costs of material possessions can be minimized in several  ways. One is through the use of beasts of burden, of which the only example  known in North America is the dog. The  presence of dogs among hunter-gatherer groups might be indicated by a vertebrate  faunal assemblage containing specimens that display carnivore gnaw marks.  Surely if dogs were kept, food scraps such as bones would have been fed to them  or they would have been opportunistically seized by the animals themselves.</p>
      <p>In the absence of dogs, group members would be  the only agents of transport for moving possessions between sites. If this is  the case, then transported materials would probably be limited to those used to  acquire resources, namely chipped stone tools and associated shafts. We assume  that high mobility results in tools or tool kits that would provide the  greatest potential utility relative to the cost of transporting them. <strong>Tool kits of mobile hunter and gatherers  should be composed of a limited number of lightweight tools so as to minimize  transport costs, while at the same time ensuring that the tools are as durable,  maintainable, and multifunctional as possible</strong>. Tools should be capable of dealing with a broad and changeable  set of actions or needs and designed to last until there is an opportunity to  replace them. Durability and multifunctionality require  increased overall tool size, but this benefit is outweighed by increased  transportation costs. Smaller-sized tools, while less costly to  transport, tend to have potentially detrimental implications because tool use  life and functional versatility are too limited. </p>
      <p><strong>The  optimal artifact design is thus the one that produces the greatest potential  utility relative to the cost of transporting it</strong>.  Bifacial tools have that capacity if made of high-quality stone. Bifaces can  have fairly sharp but durable edges that can be repeatedly resharpened, and  from which flakes can be removed for expedient use, all within a thin and  low-mass form. If bifaces are the optimal tool form  in terms of portability and potential utility, versatility, and durability,  then these tool forms should easily outnumber all other tool forms at the sites  if mobility is high, with high bifacial to unifacial tool ratios. These optimal  tool forms should give way to more task-specific or expedient tools if mobility  decreases and site use becomes intense. A  utility/mass ratio, derived from Kuhn&rsquo;s (1994) measure of potential utility  versus transport costs of the same name, for bifacial tools may provide even  more insights into the degree of mobility. Using complete or nearly complete  bifacial tools, the utility/mass ratio examines a tool&rsquo;s potential utility in  the form of the number of working edges and their total length versus its  transport costs in the form of its weight. Higher ratios would be indicative of  higher degrees of mobility.</p>
