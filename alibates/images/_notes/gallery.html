            <p class="text">The Texas Archeological Society's 1969 field school 
              will be remembered in a single word: cold! Temperatures got down 
              into the 40s at night during that week, and few of us were prepared 
              for that kind of weather in June. I remember that the owners of 
              a store over in Dumas brought out a bunch of their winter clothes 
              from the previous season to sell, and they did a land-office business. 
              Fortunately, the cold spell lasted only a few days and we were able 
              to enjoy the beautiful scenery and interesting excavations. Everyone 
              who participated felt like they discovered something, a lot of it 
              relating to the Antelope Creek occupations&#151;Borger Cordmarked 
              pottery, bone tools, and Alibates lithics.</p>

                  <div class="caption">Excavations atop the terrace overlooking Blue Creek.</div>
                  <p class="text">I had been assigned to the Beaver Patrol&#151;the 
                    kids group&#151;along with the late Emmett Shedd of Post. 
                    We were staked out on a steep slope on a terrace above Blue 
                    Creek. There were lots of falling rocks, sliding dirt, and 
                    the occasional tumbling child. The natural area around us 
                    was so compelling, we sometimes had difficulty keeping the 
                    kids focused on archeology. One of the patrol members found 
                    a big snapping turtle in the creek, and another time we watched 
                    an 8-inch-long centipede emerge from a hole in the middle 
                    of our excavation unit.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="text">Meanwhile, the adults went about their investigations 
              in other parts of the site. The photos shown here were taken by 
              the late Dr. Wallace (Wally) Williams, an osteopathic doctor at 
              the V.A. hospital in Temple, Texas. He and his wife were enthusiastic 
              supporters of TAS and a mainstay at TAS field schools. Dr. Williams 
              was a genuinely gentle man who enjoyed having friends drop by his 
              VW camper to enjoy a &#147;medicinal margarita&quot; after a hard 
              day's work. I remember him as quick to volunteer and very pleasant 
              to work with. One of his &quot;signatures&quot; was a well-shellacked 
              cardboard Shiner Beer case that held all his field equipment. He 
              also had a very good &quot;cure&quot; for those Saturday mornings 
              following Friday night parties! Over the course of his 24 seasons 
              of TAS field schools he managed to take thousands of pictures of 
              people, excavations, camp sites, artifacts and anything else that 
              caught his eye. His collection of over 3000 color slides is now 
              housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.</p>
