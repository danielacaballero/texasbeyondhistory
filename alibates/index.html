			      <p class="text">Along the sloping canyon rims of the Canadian River 
                    Valley in the Texas Panhandle are signs of an industry that 
                    has spanned the course of human history in North America. 
                    Small pits and literally tons of stone manufacturing debris 
                    bear mute testimony to perhaps 13,000 years of quarrying a 
                    brilliantly colored stone known as Alibates flint. So prized 
                    was the material that prehistoric hunters traveled&#151;or 
                    traded&#151;over distances of a thousand miles or more to 
                    obtain it. Projectile points and other tools made of Alibates 
                    stone have been found in sites as far north as Montana, as 
                    far south as Central Mexico, and east to at least the Mississippi 
                    River. </p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists for years have puzzled over the 
                    scale and range of prehistoric activities that created these 
                    remarkable sites. It is likely that some workers in search 
                    of flint merely picked up exposed chunks or cobbles lying 
                    on the ground. In fact, knappable cobbles of Alibates have 
                    eroded down the Canadian River into western Oklahoma and as 
                    far as Fort Smith, Arkansas. Other, more enterprising, workers 
                    chiseled boulders directly from the bedrock. Their quarrying 
                    activities left holes ranging from small depressions to broad 
                    pits ranging from 5 to 20 feet across and up to 2 feet deep. 
                    But what catches the eye for hundreds of yards beyond the 
                    pit perimeters are the quarry wastepiles and tool-making debris 
                    blanketing the hillslopes: thousands of quarried chunks, tested 
                    cobbles, flakes, and tools in various stages of production.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although termed &quot;flint,&quot; the stone 
                    is technically a silicified or agatized dolomite occurring 
                    in Permian-age outcroppings. These deposits, exposed as slightly 
                    undulating layers, are unique to the Panhandle area. But regardless 
                    of what the stone is called, none of the terms captures its 
                    startling beauty. In hues and tones of the evening sky, colors 
                    range from pale gray and white, to pink, maroon, and vivid 
                    red, to orange-gold and an intense purplish blue. </p>
                  <p class="text">Patterns in the stone are varied as well. Bands 
                    of alternating color create stripes and a marbled effect. 
                    Researchers have speculated about the statistically significant 
                    occurrence of red Alibates in sites, and whether the color 
                    might have invoked magical connections to the blood of animals. 
                    Clearly it was the exotic appearance of Alibates flint rather 
                    than its workability that attracted prehistoric toolmakers. 
                    Modern-day knappers report that the material has a resistant 
                    quality and hardness which makes it more difficult to flake 
                    and shape into tools than other stone, such as the Edwards 
                    cherts found abundantly in the Edwards Plateau to the south.</p>
			      <h3>Trade or Travel?</h3>
            <p class="text">Based on evidence at the Alibates locale and at sites 
              further afield, prehistoric peoples throughout the millennia have 
              used stone from the quarry to make tools and weapons. Late ice-age 
              hunters apparently sought the material to tip the weapons used to 
              kill now-extinct large game animals. Finely flaked and fluted Alibates 
              flint projectile points were found at the Blackwater Draw site in 
              eastern New Mexico. The scene of a mammoth kill, the site dates 
              to 13,000 years ago at its earliest level. </p>
                  <p class="text">Prehistoric hunters about a thousand years later 
                    left behind Alibates flint projectile points of a different 
                    style as well as a variety of other tools at the Plainview 
                    site in what is now Hale County, Texas. <br>
              <br>
              There is more evidence to suggest that later visitors to the quarry 
              mined the quarry stone more intensively than their forebears. They 
              used Alibates flint to outfit all parts of their &quot;toolkit&quot; 
              as well as to trade for other materials from other areas. </p>
			 <h3> Ruins of Early Villages</h3>
            <p class="text">Near the quarry site and along the Canadian River 
              valley are ruins of complex slabhouses and small villages attributed 
              to the later peoples who lived in the area from about A.D. 1150 
              to 1450 or later. Their culture, termed the Antelope Creek phase 
              by archeologists, is believed to have developed from indigenous 
              Plains Woodland groups who moved south into what is today the Texas-Oklahoma 
              panhandle region. Some researchers believe the migrants were drawn 
              by the water reserves of the Ogallala aquifer. The Antelope Creek 
              folk built their homes and hamlets close to springs or near the 
              river and were able to cultivate crops&#151;beans, corn, and squash&#151;on 
              a small scale. Nonetheless, hunting and gathering remained an important 
              part of their livelihood. </p>
              <p class="text"> Various farming-related artifacts and other types of evidence speak to a transitional time in the 
              area's cultural history when hunting and gathering peoples became 
              more settled, planting small fields, making pottery, and trading 
              within large networks. In exchange for Alibates chert and bison 
              products, Antelope Creek people received painted pottery, shell 
              and turquoise jewelry, pipes, and obsidian from groups in the southwest 
              and to the north.</p>
             
              
            <p class="text">Archeologist Dr. Christopher Lintz has conducted an 
              extensive study of the Antelope Creek culture, tracking changes 
              over time in the size, architecture, interiors, and lay-out of Antelope 
              Creek houses and hamlets. His studies&#151;some based on WPA-era 
              excavations of ruins at Alibates&#151;reveal complex and interesting 
              modifications within house interiors that would not be evident to 
              visitors to the ruins today. These features clearly were designed 
              to improve daily work and comfort as well as to stave off the vicissitudes 
              of nature. In some houses, stone benches lining the walls were perhaps 
              used for sleeping and work platforms; storage pits were filled with 
              foodstuffs in advance of winter. Central hearths were used for cooking 
              as well as to provide warmth, whereas entryways, or vestibules, 
              were carefully designed to trap cold air. In some houses, recessed 
              floor channels extend from the doorway through the center of the 
              house, encompassing the central hearth, and ending in a raised platform 
              perhaps designed as an altar. Lintz believes these channels were 
              dug to contain debris from the work area activities and prevent 
              it from spreading into the sleeping areas. In all, Lintz identified 
              11 different patterns of house types. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today, these important village ruins and quarry 
                    sites are protected and preserved, thanks to the efforts and 
                    foresight of the Potter County Historical Survey Committee 
                    and concerned individuals. In the early 1960s, then-vice-chairman 
                    Harry Hertner mounted an extensive campaign to bring the site 
                    to the attention of Congress. With letters of support from 
                    noted archeologists across the country and with Sen. Ralph 
                    Yarborough and Rep. Walter Rogers carrying the legislation, 
                    the Alibates flint quarries were established as a national 
                    monument, the only such site in Texas.  The Visitor Center for Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is on Cas Johnson Road off of Highway 136 between Amarillo and Fritch, Texas. Arrangements for tours of the quarries Monday-Friday may be made by calling  806-857-3151.
