            <p class="text">The Texas Archeological Society's 1969 field school 
              will be remembered in a single word: cold! Temperatures got down 
              into the 40s at night during that week, and few of us were prepared 
              for that kind of weather in June. I remember that the owners of 
              a store over in Dumas brought out a bunch of their winter clothes 
              from the previous season to sell, and they did a land-office business. 
              Fortunately, the cold spell lasted only a few days and we were able 
              to enjoy the beautiful scenery and interesting excavations. Everyone 
              who participated felt like they discovered something, a lot of it 
              relating to the Antelope Creek occupations&#151;Borger Cordmarked 
              pottery, bone tools, and Alibates lithics.</p>

                  <div class="caption">Excavations atop the terrace overlooking Blue Creek.</div>
                  <p class="text">I had been assigned to the Beaver Patrol&#151;the 
                    kids group&#151;along with the late Emmett Shedd of Post. 
                    We were staked out on a steep slope on a terrace above Blue 
                    Creek. There were lots of falling rocks, sliding dirt, and 
                    the occasional tumbling child. The natural area around us 
                    was so compelling, we sometimes had difficulty keeping the 
                    kids focused on archeology. One of the patrol members found 
                    a big snapping turtle in the creek, and another time we watched 
                    an 8-inch-long centipede emerge from a hole in the middle 
                    of our excavation unit.</p>
            <p></p>
                  <p class="text">Meanwhile, the adults went about their investigations 
                    in other parts of the site. The photos shown here were taken 
                    by the late Dr. Wallace (Wally) Williams, an osteopathic doctor 
                    at the V.A. hospital in Temple, Texas. He and his wife were 
                    enthusiastic supporters of TAS and a mainstay at TAS field 
                    schools. Dr. Williams was a genuinely gentle man who enjoyed 
                    having friends drop by his VW camper to enjoy a &#147;medicinal 
                    margarita&quot; after a hard day's work. I remember him as 
                    quick to volunteer and very pleasant to work with. One of 
                    his &quot;signatures&quot; was a well-shellacked cardboard 
                    Shiner Beer case that held all his field equipment. He also 
                    had a very good &quot;cure&quot; for those Saturday mornings 
                    following Friday night parties! Over the course of his 24 
                    seasons of TAS field schools he managed to take thousands 
                    of pictures of people, excavations, camp sites, artifacts 
                    and anything else that caught his eye. His collection of over 
                    3000 color slides is now housed at the Texas Archeological 
                    Research Laboratory.</p>
