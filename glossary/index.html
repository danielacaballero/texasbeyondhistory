            <p class="text">Flood plains and river deltas are two common landforms 
              that are composed of alluvium. Floodplains are often referred to 
              as alluvial terraces. They are called terraces because floodplains 
              are typically flat and level. Through time, as rivers meander back 
              and forth across floodplains and as riverbeds become deeper, they 
              leave behind alluvial terraces of different heights and different 
              ages. In general, the terraces that are highest and furthest away 
              from a river are the oldest whereas the modern floodplain or terrace 
              is the lowest one and the present riverbank. Archeologists pay a 
              lot of attention to floodplains because many sites are located on 
              or within alluvium. </p>

            <p class="text">Often mistakenly called &quot;bird points,&quot; tiny

              shot by an accurate archer. They are small because the arrow shafts 
              to which they were affixed were thin and light, often made of cane. 
              In prehistoric times most arrow points were made of chipped stone, 
              usually chert (&quot;flint&quot;). But along the Texas coast where 
              chert was scarce, arrow points were also fashioned out of seashells. 
              When the Spanish and French brought iron and brass to North America 
              in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Native Americans quickly 
              started fashioning arrow points out of metal scraps. By the mid-1800s 
              standardized manufactured iron arrow points were part of the fur 
              trade. </p>

            <p class="text">Ideally, physically associated artifacts (i.e., things 
              found together) are also functionally associated, meaning they were 
              used together at more or less the same time. For example, groups 
              of artifacts such as pottery vessels are sometimes found together 
              accompanying a human burial. Such grave goods found together with 
              a single burial represent a single moment in time&#151;the burial 
              of the deceased&#151;an obvious case of close association. In contrast, 
              in many other circumstances it is not clear whether two things found 
              side-by-side were actually left behind at the same time. Most archeological 
              sites do not represent moments in time, but are instead accumulations 
              of things that may have been discarded days, months, or even years 
              apart. A smart archeologist critically evaluates artifact associations 
              and looks for compelling evidence that things found together belong 
              together.</p>

              end and a handle at the other. They are used to hurl darts (lightweight

              the reach of the human arm by 18 inches or so, darts can be thrown 
              with considerable force and accuracy. Using atlatl-thrown darts, 
              Aztec warriors were able to penetrate the light Spanish armor worn 
              by Spanish conquistadors under Cortez, killing many. In prehistoric 
              Texas, the atlatl and dart was the main weapon system in use for 
              10,000 years or more until they were replaced by the bow and arrow

              crucial to its interpretation. In addition to <b>physical context</b>, 
              we refer to an artifact's <b>behavioral context</b>, meaning the 
              original conditions within which an artifact was used or discarded. 
              Similarly, <b>social context</b> is the nature of the society or 
              group of people that created and used an artifact (or site or feature).

            <p class="text">While archeologists can directly observe and record 
              an artifact's physical context, the behavioral and social contexts 
              are conditions in the past that no longer exist today. Therefore, 
              these kinds of contexts are inferred based on many different lines 
              of evidence starting with physical context. </p>
            <p class="text">For example, suppose you find the remains of ancient 
              cooking pit&#151;a circular arrangement of fire-cracked rocks, charcoal, 
              ash, and animal bones including the burned and fractured bones of 
              a deer. Judging from this physical context and the appearance of 
              the bones, you might reason that a deer was cooked at this spot 
              and probably eaten nearby. The cooking and eating are part of the 
              behavioral context&#151;something you can't see but can make an 
              educated guess about. If the cooking pit was found near the mouth 
              of a small cave, you might further reason that the social context 
              was that of a very small group, perhaps members of a single family. 
              You can see how tenuous such inferences are&#151;good archeologists 
              are cautious when trying to reconstruct behavioral and social context. 
              That is why you see us use so many &quot;weasel words&quot;&#151;probably, 
              possibly, maybe, perhaps&#151;absolutely certainty is rare in archeology.</p>

              (Spears are actually handheld thrusting weapons.) The atlatl and 
              dart were used for over 12,000 years in Texas before being replaced 
              by the bow and arrow between about AD 500-800. True arrowheads or 
              arrow points are noticeably smaller and lighter than dart heads. 
              Dart points are fashioned from chert (&quot;flint&quot;) and certain 
              other glasslike stones. They are prized by artifact collectors, 
              but valued by archeologists because they are sensitive &quot;time-markers&quot; 
              because, through time, dart point &quot;styles&quot; changed. Some 
              of the differences in shape and size are also related to function. 
              For example, heavy, broad-bladed dart points are often found in

              the rivers and temporary waterholes called tinajas within the smaller 
              canyons provided reliable water sources. For over 13,000 years prehistoric

              The generally dry conditions coupled with the protected rockshelters

            <h3><span class="glossaryword">Radiocarbon Dating:</span> A method of estimating the age of organic (formerly living) materials younger than 55,000 years based on the amount of radioactive carbon isotope carbon-14 (14C) that remains in them.</h3>
            <p class="text">Since the 1950s, radiocarbon dating has been one of archeology's most important analytical tools. In the late 1940s, Willard Libby developed the radiocarbon dating method, which is based on the idea that all living things incorporate carbon from the atmosphere, and that after death radioactive isotope carbon-14 decays without replenishment, at a known, measurable rate.  Radiocarbon has a half-life of about 5730 years, meaning that a 5730-year-old organic object has about half as much carbon-14 as it did when it was alive. </p>
            <p class="text">Virtually any organic material including bone, plant fibers, and wood charcoal, to name only a few, can be dated. Some materials, however, yield much more reliable dates than others. In many archeological excavations the preferred material to date is charcoal (charred wood or other plant part). In part, this is because charred plants preserve better than uncharred plants, and because there are typically less complexities with dating plants than bone or shell. Using conventional radiocarbon dating methods, it takes about a handful of charcoal to get a reliable date estimate. With the newer AMS (accelerator mass spectrometer) radiocarbon dating method only a tiny sample, the size of a grain of rice or smaller, is necessary. </p>
            <p class="text">The radiocarbon dating method yields age estimates, rather than definite calendar dates. Radiocarbon ages are a date range expressed in the number of years before the present coupled with an error estimate. For example, the radiocarbon age of one of the charcoal samples analyzed from Bone Bed 2 at Bonfire Shelter is 10,300 +/- 160 BP. The method hinges on the fact that living organisms (like plants and animals) take in atmospheric carbon through metabolic processes like photosynthesis (in plants) and eating (for animals). A tiny portion of atmospheric carbon is radioactive 14C. Upon death, an organism ceases to take in atmospheric carbon and the radioactive 14C slowly begins to decay at a known rate. AMS measures the ratio of stable carbon isotopes to radioactive carbon, and from this measurement scientists can calculate the approximate age of the sample. In contrast, conventional dating methods directly count the rate of decaying radiocarbon. Both methods calculate a radiocarbon age based on that measured quantity of 14C and the radiocarbon half-life.</p>
            <p class="text">A complicating factor is that the amount of 14C in the atmosphere varied over time due to factors like volcanic activity changing the atmospheric carbon ratio, the industrial revolution adding fossil (ancient, "dead") carbon to the atmosphere, and atomic bomb explosions which cause the creation of extra radiocarbon. Scientists compensate for these atmospheric variations by constructing calibration curves based on radiocarbon dates from known-age materials like tree rings from long-lived species such as the bristlecone pines of California, which can live as long as 3,000 years. Over the years, new and better calibration curves are constructed. Previous radiocarbon ages can be recalibrated using new curves. It is important to remember that radiocarbon dates are estimates of the true age of whatever material is being dated and are presented as a range of possible dates, not one year. Most of the references to radiocarbon dates in this website are calibrated calendar ages unless specified as "radiocarbon years before present" (RCYBP), which is the uncalibrated radiocarbon age.</p>

            <p class="text">Examples of archeological sites include an Indian 
              campground, a rockshelter and a Spanish Colonial mission. The site 
              concept is very important in archeology because the location of 
              a site provides a unique identity. Archeologists carefully document 
              where they find ancient and historic remains; the location of each 
              noticeably separate concentration is marked on a topographic map. 
              Each unique location reported by an archeologist in Texas gets its 
              own site number using the Smithsonian trinomial system. Thus Bonfire 
              Shelter near Langtry has the designation 41VV218; Texas was the 
              41st state when the system was invented, VV stands for Val Verde 
              County, and Bonfire Shelter was the 218th site in Val Verde County 
              to be officially recorded (today there are over 2,000 recorded sites 
              in Val Verde County). There are official site records for over 54,000 
              archeological sites in Texas that are maintained at the Texas Archeological 
              Research Laboratory, the central repository for site records in 
              Texas. </p>

              cultural layers that make up an archeological site.</h3>
            <p class="text">Technically, stratigraphy is the actual study of such 
              layers, but archeologists often use the term to refer to the layering 
              of a site as its &quot;stratigraphy.&quot; Understanding a site's 
              stratigraphy is crucial to archeologists because the layers (often 
              called &quot;strata&quot;) can reveal a great deal about how a site 
              formed over time. In general, younger layers are deposited atop 
              older layers and younger artifacts are found above older artifacts. 
              There are, however, many circumstances in which age reversals and 
              mixing occurs. </p>
            <p class="text">A simple example is digging a hole through two layers, 
              A and B, and piling the dirt from both layers in one pile on the 
              ground surface. Assume that there are artifacts in both layers and 
              that Layer B formed before the overlying Layer A. If the hole is 
              refilled by randomly scraping the pile of soil back into the hole, 
              the fill layer will now contain a mixture of artifacts of different 
              ages. Suppose the person who dug the hole tossed in an aluminum 
              can before she started filling it back in. This would now be a case 
              of &quot;reverse stratigraphy&quot; because the recent can would 
              be buried beneath a mixed fill layer containing older artifacts. 
              Archeological sites often experience similar sequences of events, 
              making the task of unraveling stratigraphy very challenging.</p>

            <p class="text">Archeologists depend on several kinds of topographic 
              maps. For locating sites, the fine maps produced by the United States 
              Geological Survey (USGS) are usually used, especially the 7.5' topographic 
              quadrangles, which cover 7.5 minutes of latitude by 7.5 minutes 
              of longitude: east-west dimensions are 7 miles (11.3 km) in north 
              Texas, 7.8 miles (12.6 km) in south Texas; north-south dimensions 
              are 8.67 miles (14 km) for all parts of the state. USGS 7.5' maps 
              are available for the entire state of Texas and most of the U S 
              through the <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/" target="_blank" class="text">U 
              S Geological Survey</a> and the <a href="http://www.tnris.state.tx.us/" target="_blank" class="text">Texas 
              Natural Resources Information System</a>.</p>
            <p class="text">To show the finer topographic details of an archeological 
              site, archeologists often create their own topographic maps using 
              surveying equipment. Today many archeologists use a computerized 
              electronic survey tool known as a total data station (TDS) to create 
              maps. Earlier generations of archeologists relied on optical surveying 
              equipment including transits and the plane table and alidade. The 
              latter is a particularly effective tool because it allows archeologists 
              to draw what they are mapping as they go along. With transit readings 
              or a TDS, the map is drawn back in the laboratory and sometimes 
              suffers from missing details. Ideally, one combines the measured 
              distances and elevations with firsthand observations to create a 
              map that accurately and completely conveys what the archeological 
              site looks like.</p>
