                  <p class="text"> In the rugged Rustler Hills of far west Texas, 
                    a small cave has provided poignant insights into prehistoric 
                    family life. For more than 1200 years, small groups of hunters 
                    and gatherers visited Granado Cave, some making a temporary, 
                    or seasonal, home there. They left behind a wealth of evidence 
                    about their day to day lives: fragments of meals, cooking 
                    &quot;appliances,&quot; tools, mats and basketry. They also 
                    left haunting reminders of tragic events long ago&#151;the 
                    deaths of loved ones. </p>
                  <p class="text">Judging from the burials in the cave, children, 
                    in particular, were accorded special attention in death. They 
                    were carefully covered by, or placed within, ritually &quot;killed&quot; 
                    woven bags and baskets containing fascinating offerings&#151;a 
                    special rattlesnake rattle, a set of deer-hoof &quot;tinklers,&quot; 
                    even the skin of a large bird head (probably a goose).</p>
                  <p class="text"> For archeologists, Granado Cave provides a 
                    window into the past and small glimpses of innovative and 
                    caring peoples trying to make a living in this harsh desert 
                    area. The cave's protective shelter and the region's dry climate 
                    have preserved fragile artifacts and other remains of prehistoric 
                    life that would not have survived in most other areas of the 
                    state. </p>
                  <h3>Setting </h3>
                  <p class="text">Granado Cave is in the northeastern part of 
                    the Trans-Pecos region in eastern Culbertson County, about 
                    halfway between El Paso and Midland, Texas. This region forms 
                    the northeastern corner of the vast <strong>Chihuahuan Desert</strong>, 
                    North America's largest desert. Vegetation in the area is 
                    extremely sparse, as less than 12 inches (30 centimeters) 
                    of rain falls in an average year.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The cave is located on the western edge of 
                    the <strong>Ruster Hills</strong>, a chain of low hills that 
                    runs north to south between the Guadalupe and Delaware Mountains 
                    to the west and the Pecos River to the east. Flanking the 
                    Rustler Hills on the west is the <strong>Great Gypsum Plain</strong>, 
                    a desolate stretch with little vegetation  and almost no 
                    surface water. The only waterholes near the cave are along 
                    draws where rainwater occasionally and briefly drains and 
                    where a few springs can be found. Unfortunately, the heavily 
                    mineral-laden water is all but undrinkable. The prehistoric 
                    peoples who lived in the Rustler Hills obviously learned to 
                    drink the water and, judging from evidence in the cave, suffered 
                    the consequences&#151;habitual diarrhea.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Rustler Hills are the eroded remnants of 
                    a dolomite (magnesium-rich limestone) geological formation 
                    that overlies the thick layers of gypsum, anhydrite, and sulfur 
                    that form the Great Gypsum Plain. This pockmarked terrain 
                    is known as a <strong>karst</strong> region. Through the eons, 
                    rainwater percolated through cracks and fissures in the porous 
                    rock and mineral layers forming solution cavities (&quot;caves&quot;) 
                    and sinkholes. </p>
                  <h3>Site</h3>
                  <p class="text">The Granado Cave archeological site consists 
                    of the cave itself, the opening or entrance area, and a variety 
                    of cultural features that surround the entrance. The cave 
                    proper is a solution cavity that extends for over 200 feet 
                    (about 60 meters) beyond the cave opening. The entrance to 
                    Granado Cave is a sinkhole or circular depression that opens 
                    near the top of a hill. </p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the sinkhole is filled with natural 
                    and human debris: a &quot;talus&quot; cone made up of the 
                    collapsed dolomite bedrock that formed the opening along with 
                    tons of fist-sized fire-cracked (&quot;burned&quot;) dolomite 
                    rocks. The <b>burned rocks</b> are evidence of prehistoric 
                    cooking. Prehistoric cooks found that the sinkhole provided 
                    a convenient windbreak and partially sheltered place for baking 
                    plants such as agave lechugilla. To cook this semi-succulent 
                    desert plant, prehistoric peoples used layered arrangements 
                    of hot rocks and earth that archeologists call <strong>earth 
                    ovens</strong>. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Most of the interior of the cave is quite dark 
                    even on a bright, sunny day. Thus it is no surprise that the 
                    occupational debris is confined to what the archeologists 
                    called the <strong>anteroom</strong>, the area just within 
                    the opening where there is enough daylight to see what you 
                    are doing. </p>
                  <p class="text">Outside the mouth of Granado Cave are a series 
                    of cultural features or activity areas used by the cave inhabitants. 
                    The most prominent outside features are three <strong>ring 
                    middens</strong>, donut-shaped baking pits ringed by mounded 
                    accumulations of burned rocks. Nearby are three <strong>bedrock 
                    mortars</strong>, small circular holes in the dolomite that 
                    were probably used for pulverizing seeds or other plant foods. 
                    Prehistoric toolmakers knapped stones into tools nearby, leaving 
                    behind a thin scatter of tool-making debris surrounding the 
                    entrance to the cave. </p>
                  <p class="text"> A total of ten prehistoric <strong>human burials</strong> 
                    were found in Granado Cave. These included at least five infants 
                    or children and five adults. Most of the graves included associated 
                    material probably representing offerings. Some of the skeletons 
                    show evidence of pathologies&#151;bone damage caused by disease, 
                    accidents, or dietary stress. All of the burials except one 
                    were located fairly near the entrance of the cave. The other 
                    was placed in almost total darkness at the far eastern end 
                    of the cave, </p>
                  <h3>Castile Culture </h3>
                  <p class="text"> The native peoples who visited Granado Cave 
                    and other sites in the Rustler Hills can be called simply 
                    the <strong>Rustler Hills people</strong> or, more formally, 
                    the Castile culture (or phase). The relationship between the 
                    local inhabitants who lived here 450-1800 years ago and the 
                    Indian groups who lived in the region in early historic times 
                    (16th and 17th centuries) is not clear. The historically known 
                    groups include the Manso, Suma, and Jumano tribes. The Granado 
                    Cave research indicates that the original occupants of the 
                    Rustler Hills were a remnant group who may have spoken a language 
                    unrelated to the historically known groups. Researchers suspect 
                    that the Rustler Hills people were pushed into this harsh 
                    and uninviting environment by surrounding groups of people 
                    who were more numerous and lived in more favorable localities.</p>
                  <p class="text">As a result of the work at Granado Cave, the 
                    <strong>Castile phase </strong>or <strong>culture</strong> 
                    has been defined to describe a hunting and gathering culture, 
                    with distinctive artifacts and lifeways, that occupied the 
                    Great Gypsum Plain and Rustler Hills from at least A.D. 200 
                    to about A.D. 1450. Their economy was based on a narrow range 
                    of plant foods, including grasses, lechugilla, sotol, mesquite, 
                    and various cacti. Rabbits, rodents, and small reptiles were 
                    a regular part of the diet. Deer and antelope were hunted, 
                    but these larger and more desirable prey animals were rarely 
                    available. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Artifacts distinctive to this culture include 
                    the <strong>Rustler Hills Ki&acirc;h&acirc;</strong>, a type 
                    of carrying basket, and the <strong>Rustler Hills Twined Grass 
                    Bag</strong>, made of large coils of retted grass. Also present 
                    are distinctive parching baskets and twilled sotol leaf mats. 
                    <strong>Fishtail sandals</strong> made of narrow-leaf yucca 
                    appear to have been worn primarily by children. These appear 
                    to be the only type of sandals found in this culture phase. 
                    Both cotton cordage and woven cotton were used by the Castile 
                    culture. The presence of Southwestern pottery at the cave 
                    speaks to trade contacts with people to the north and northwest.
