                  <p class="text">In 1976, <strong>Frank Granado</strong>, a surveyor 
                    from the nearby town of Pecos discovered prehistoric burials 
                    in a previously unknown cave in the Rustler Hills. An article 
                    soon appeared in the local paper. The site was brought to 
                    the attention of Curtis Tunnell, then the state archeologist 
                    of Texas. Tunnell recalled that archeologist <strong>Donny 
                    L. Hamilton</strong> was raised in Pecos and thought he might 
                    be interested in following up on the newspaper account. Hamilton, 
                    then a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, 
                    jumped at the chance. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Hamilton met with Granado and arranged to see 
                    the cave, which was located near <strong>Caldwell Shelter 
                    No. 1</strong> and <strong>Brooks Cave</strong>, both fairly 
                    well known and significant archeological sites. Granado Cave 
                    was named after its discoverer and given the official archeological 
                    designation 41CU8. Ready to advance the project, Mr. Granado 
                    allowed Hamilton to study his private collection of artifacts 
                    from the site. </p>
                  <p class="text">Several months later, Hamilton returned to Granado 
                    Cave with a small archeological crew to document the site 
                    and carry out test excavations. The rich archeological potential 
                    of the cave soon became evident. Recognizing this, <strong>Shelby 
                    Brooks</strong>, the owner of the land on which Granado Cave 
                    and Brooks Cave are located, allowed both sites to be nominated 
                    for designation as <strong>State Archeological Landmarks</strong> 
                    (SALs). As such, they became the first SALs located on private 
                    property in Texas.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Previous Archeological Research </h3>
                  <p class="text">Over the years, many of the various caves and 
                    sinkholes of the Rustler Hills have been explored and partially 
                    dug up by treasure hunters, artifact collectors, and early 
                    archeologists. In 1932, archeologist <strong>E. B. (Ted) Sayles</strong> 
                    of the Gila Pueblo research center in Arizona spent a few 
                    days digging at two rockshelters that became known as the 
                    <strong>Caldwell Shelters</strong>. His work was rudimentary 
                    and only sketchily reported, but he did call attention to 
                    the area's archeological significance. Two years later, <strong>A. 
                    T. Jackson</strong> of the University of Texas and a small 
                    crew of assistants spent five weeks excavating at five sites 
                    in the Rustler Hills. This work was also poorly reported and 
                    Jackson failed to note that two of the sites were the Caldwell 
                    Shelters where Sayles had previously dug. This led to considerable 
                    confusion in the archeological records that was not sorted 
                    out for many decades. </p>
                  <p class="text">Among the important sites that archeologists 
                    have documented near Granado Cave are the Caldwell Shelters 
                    (41CU1 and 41CU2), the McAlpin Caves (41CU5 and 41CU6), Brooks 
                    Cave (41CU7), and ELCOR Cave (no assigned site number). Although 
                    none of these sites were systematically excavated and reported, 
                    the unusually well-preserved artifacts and burials found at 
                    the caves and shelters in the Rustler Hills have the potential 
                    to tell us much about prehistoric life in the area. Hamilton's 
                    work at Granado Cave in 1976 and 1978 was the first modern 
                    scientific dig in the area. </p>

                          Cave. Unfortunately, their work was rudimentary and
