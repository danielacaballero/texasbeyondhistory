                  <p class="text">Archeologists uncovered a fascinating array 
                    of artifacts in Granado Cave, including intricate perishable 
                    items woven of plant fibers, chipped stone tools, and pottery. 
                    These materials, some mundane, others perhaps related to ceremonies 
                    and rituals&#151;including burials&#151; tell of a skilled, 
                    industrious, and caring people who were well-adapted to the 
                    harsh terrain and who knew how to make the most of the comparatively 
                    scant resources. Conservative hunter-gatherers, they used 
                    reliable materials and established construction techniques 
                    that had been tried and proven over centuries of use.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the section below, we present a gallery of 
                    representative artifacts. Some, such as fiber sandals and 
                    the distinctive carrying baskets known as ki&acirc;h&acirc;s, 
                    were so well preserved that they could be interpretively reconstructed 
                    to learn more about the technology (see <a href="sandals.html" class="text">Reconstructing 
                    Sandals</a> and <a href="kiaha.html" class="text">Reconstructing 
                    a Ki&acirc;h&acirc;</a><em> </em>sections). </p>
                  <h3>Cordage and Cotton </h3>
                  <p><span class="text">The procurement of materials for producing 
                    cordage, the processing of the fiber, and the twisting of 
                    the fiber into one, two or even three plies, must have been 
                    one of the most time-consuming tasks among the inhabitants 
                    of Granado Cave. Large quantities of cordage were needed to 
                    make the carrying baskets, mats, bags and other objects recovered 
                    from the site. The cordage was typically manufactured from 
                    narrow-leaf yucca fibers, although some is made from agave 
                    fiber or cotton. The fiber from yucca can be extracted by 
                    pulling the leaves from the plant and then scraping them, 
                    or by steaming or boiling them. </span></p>
                  <p><span class="text"> The presence of cotton cordage is interesting 
                    since cotton was not grown locally. It is one indication of 
                    trade and other contacts with agriculturalists to the north, 
                    west, or southwest. On the basis of other trade items found 
                    at Granado&#151;pottery and shells&#151;the source of the 
                    cotton is most likely either the villages to the west on the 
                    Rio Grande or in northern Chihuahua. The radiocarbon dates 
                    associated with the cotton artifacts are the earliest dates 
                    for cotton in Texas.</span><br>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Basketry </h3>
                  <p class="text">Basketry from Granado Cave shows influence of 
                    traits from the Pueblo areas to the north, the various groups 
                    around El Paso, and other hunting and gathering groups from 
                    the region. However, some techniques may be unique to the 
                    Rustler Hills. Two cord-mesh carrying baskets, known as ki&acirc;h&acirc;s, 
                    and several coiled parching basket fragments were recovered. 
                    The latter types had a thin layer of fine mud/clay to keep 
                    the surface from charring when parching seeds.</p>
                  <p class="text"><span class="text">In order to better understand 
                    the process of their construction, a small <a href="kiaha.html" class="text">ki&acirc;h&acirc;</a> 
                    was reconstructed.</span><br>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Matting, Bags and Sandals </h3>
                  <p class="text">Fragments of matting, woven sandals, whole burial 
                    bags, and other plaited and twined items were recovered from 
                    the cave. They are comparable in terms of materials and construction 
                    techniques to those from other areas of the Trans-Pecos region 
                    and the Southwest in general. An important exception is the 
                    distinctive &quot;Rustler Hills Twined Grass Bag,&quot; a 
                    type found as yet only in three caves: Caldwell Shelter No. 
                    1, Brooks Cave, and Granado Cave. Made of twined coils of 
                    retted fiber, the bags had many uses ranging from seed storage, 
                    to carrying pouches, to burial containers. <br>
                  </p>
                  <h3>Wood Artifacts </h3>
                  <p class="text">There is a general lack of wood 
                    artifacts from the excavated cave sites of 
                    the Rustler Hills. The most common wood artifacts 
                    found in the area are throwing sticks, commonly 
                    called &quot;rabbit sticks.&quot; Cane arrows 
                    with wooden foreshafts, and decorated split 
                    agave flower stalks have also been recovered. 
                    At Granado Cave, broken rabbit sticks were 
                    the most common wood artifacts recovered. 
                    A notched rhythm stick and its sounding stick 
                    were also found, as well as broken arrows 
                    shafts.</p>
                  <h3>Pottery </h3>
                  <p class="text">There is no evidence that pottery 
                    was produced in the Rustler Hills. The small 
                    quantities found in the area are of types 
                    originating in the Casas Grandes area, located 
                    to the southwest; in the agricultural villages 
                    around El Paso to the west; and the Pueblo 
                    groups to the north. The source of the more 
                    common brown ware type is more difficult to 
                    determine, but is known to have been made 
                    both in the scattered pithouse villages of 
                    Southeast New Mexico and the adjacent area 
                    of Texas. One Mata Red-on-Brown Textured jar 
                    and 21 sherds were recovered from the excavations 
                    at Granado Cave. The jar was covered with 
                    soot, showing that it was used for cooking. 
                    It had been repaired with cordage and resin-coated 
                    grass patches several times. </p>
                  <h3>Lithics </h3>
                  <p class="text">The chipped stone assemblage recovered from 
                    Granado Cave was sorted and classified on the basis of the 
                    reduction technology displayed by each artifact. The collection 
                    was very meager and included water worn nodules; cores; flake 
                    tools; modified flakes; utilized sequent flakes; chert agave/sotol 
                    knives; utilized flakes; unifaces; drills/perforators; along 
                    with a few arrow points, dart points, and bifaces. The finding 
                    of agave/sotol knives attests to the importance of plant processing 
                    at the site, as evidenced also by the three earth ovens (circular 
                    burned rock middens) found near the front of the cave.</p>
                  <h3>Other Artifacts </h3>
                  <p class="text">Other recovered items include 
                    a number of possible ceremonial items, such 
                    as an unusual cone made of limonite, two unfired 
                    red clay balls, a rattlesnake-rattler rattle, 
                    and a deer-hoof tinkler. Several of these 
                    items are unique to Granado Cave, and their 
                    function is not understood.</p>
                  <p class="text">Numerous pieces of tanned skin 
                    showing unusual skinning techniques that left 
                    the skin tubular were also found; they were 
                    probably tanned with a paste made of brain 
                    tissue. A unique bird-head skin is believed  
                    to be from a waterfowl, possibly a goose.</p>
                  <p class="text">Only four bone tools were present 
                    in Granado Cave, three of which were placed 
                    with Burial 1. In addition to two bone awls, 
                    a weaving tool made from a deer rib was identified.</p>
                  <p class="text">Beads made from shell or plant 
                    seeds were found in association with four 
                    of the burials. The shells were from the Pacific 
                    Ocean and Gulf of California, reflecting the 
                    extent of trade networks. At least 35 feather 
                    quills were found in association with Burial 
                    1.</p>
                  <p class="text">A single piece of desiccated 
                    fruit was identified using an X-ray, which 
                    revealed seeds consistent with the fleshy 
                    capsules of Torrey yucca. Such capsules are 
                    known to have been consumed for food. A bottle 
                    gourd stained dark red with hematite was also 
                    recovered.</p>
