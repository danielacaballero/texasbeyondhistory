            <p class="text">The Brownsville-Barril complex or culture is the name 
              that archeologists have given to the remains left by the little-known 
              Indian groups who occupied the Rio Grande Delta at the extreme southern 
              tip of Texas during the time period of A.D. 1100-1700. The low-lying 
              tropical delta area was one of the last parts of northeastern Mexico 
              to be explored and settled by the Spanish. They did not turn their 
              attention to the Rio Grande Delta until 1747, about 150 years after 
              they first established towns in Nuevo Leon and Coahuila. The mid-eighteenth 
              century accounts suggest that as many as 50 named Indian groups 
              lived in the Rio Grande Delta. Based on the archeological record 
              of the preceding centuries, the basic lifeway seen by the Spanish 
              when they entered the region was little different from that of the 
              later prehistoric peoples. There is little evidence of Archaic and 
              earlier occupations in the Rio Grande Delta probably because earlier 
              evidence has been buried by flood deposits or destroyed by hurricanes.</p>
            <p class="text">The peoples of the Rio Grande Delta were hunters, 
              fishers, shellfish collectors, and plant gatherers who moved frequently 
              as the seasons, tides, and food supplies dictated. They lived in 
              a semi-arid, semi-tropical environment and camped on small rises 
              along the many bays, lagoons, oxbow lakes, and estuaries. From these 
              waterways they harvested shellfish and fish for food and seashells 
              as raw material. The Rio Grande Delta is almost devoid of natural 
              stone&#151;instead it is built of mud carried down the river by 
              floods and sand pushed up from the Gulf of Mexico by hurricanes 
              and strong currents. Having no flint or other stone, the Brownsville-Barril 
              people used seashells to fashion an amazing variety of shell tools 
              and ornaments including projectile points shaped from conch shell, 
              carved conch shell pendants, olive shell tinklers/bells, freshwater 
              and marine shell beads, and many other tool forms.</p>
            <p class="text">These shell artifacts were traded to more settled 
              peoples further to the south in northeastern Mexico along the periphery 
              of Mesoamerica, the great heartland of civilization that stretched 
              from northern Mexico to Costa Rica. In exchange, the Brownsville-Barril 
              peoples received exotic items including pottery, jade, and obsidian 
              that are rarely found in Texas beyond the Rio Grand Delta. In fact 
              this is one of the most interesting archeological questions about 
              the area: What was the nature of trade and contact between these 
              nomadic delta peoples and the much more sophisticated cultures to 
              the south?</p>
            <p class="text">The people of the Rio Grande Delta were also distinctive 
              in the manner in which they buried their dead. Individuals were 
              buried in tightly flexed positions, and graves were located away 
              from living areas. The deceased was accompanied by offerings such 
              as shell beads and pendants, animal and human bone awls, and bone 
              beads or tubes used as jewelry. With some burials, red pigment powder 
              was strewn over the burial. Others included Mesoamerican goods such 
              as prehistoric pottery vessels from the Tampico, Mexico region, 
              obsidian (volcanic glass) arrow points from sources in central Mexico, 
              and greenstone (jadeite) jewelry, also from Mexico.</p>
            <p class="text">Much of what is known about the Brownsville-Barril 
              complex is due to the efforts of a civil engineer and draftsman 
              from Brownsville, Texas. From 1917 to 1941, Andrew Eliot Anderson, 
              took extensive notes, drafted maps, and collected distinctive artifacts 
              from archeological sites of the Rio Grande Delta and Laguna Madre 
              of coastal south Texas and northeastern Mexico. After World War 
              II, the area was drastically transformed by land clearing, agricultural 
              modification, and urban development. Today most of the sites that 
              Anderson visited have been destroyed. The A. E. Anderson collection, 
              now housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, is a 
              crucial research resource. </p>
            <p class="text">The Rio Grande Delta of today bears scarce resemblance 
              to its appearance prior to the twentieth century. The great river 
              has been reduced to a trickle by upstream dams and heavy agricultural 
              demand. The fertile soils and mix of marsh, waterways, and raised 
              areas have been homogenized&#151;the smaller waterways filled in, 
              the clay dunes flattened, and the area covered by expanses of agricultural 
              fields, orchards, and urban areas. The majority of the archeological 
              record has been destroyed, particularly the most fragile and most 
              visible materials that were once common on and near the surface. 
              The best potential for learning more about the Brownsville-Barril 
              complex is a combination of renewed ethnohistoric research&#151;combing 
              the Spanish archives for eyewitness accounts of the native peoples 
              of the Rio Grande delta&#151;and analyses of the existing collections 
              and notes. </p><br>
