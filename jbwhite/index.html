            <p>This is the story of finding,  excavating, and understanding one small prehistoric campsite located on the floodplain of the Little River in Milam County, Texas. This camp is one of many places in the area where native peoples (Native American Indians) lived about 700 to 1,400 years ago. Their many other camps and  villages were scattered within the valleys of the Little River and its tributaries.  The  territories of local groups probably extended eastward to the Brazos River and westward to  the  Balcones Escarpment, the edge of the Edwards Plateau.</p>
            <p>The site is named for  avocational  archeologist and collector J. B. White, who  likely crossed over his  namesake site on one of his many excursions through the fields and stream  valleys of the county during the 1930s. In an article he wrote for the <em>Central Texas Archeologist</em> he extolls the  archeological richness of the Little River area: </p>
           <p class="margintext">
		   <br><em>Indian villages  dot the banks of the Little River. A chain of gravel hills feature the ancient  bed of this stream which now throws the flood against the east bank. Down the  valley of the river lie ancient lakes and around these depressions that once  was the channel of the stream, camps can be found. In fact from Bell County  on the west to Brazos on the east Little River  remains our greatest Indian stream.</em><br><br>
                 J. B. White, 1937</p>
             <p>Although there have been few  large-scale archeological investigations in the Milam County area, there is good reason to  put stock in White&rsquo;s somewhat hyperbolic prose. The local area is rich in natural  resources and these would have served as  powerful attractants to hunting and gathering  peoples. In this region, the Little River flows eastward from the Escarpment  across the Blackland Prairies and into the Oak Woodlands. These two different  ecological  zones and the floodplain forest adjacent to the river provided a  wealth of resources from which prehistoric groups could make a living. These  resources included easy access to water, a great variety of animals and plants  for food, wood for fuel, and flint or chert for tools.</p>
            <p>The site&rsquo;s location along the Little  River  was advantageous for the people who lived there, since the river  provided an east-west link to other Indian peoples in adjacent regions. The information recovered from  the J. B. White site provides a glimpse of how these groups organized  themselves across this landscape to take advantage of natural resources, as well as how they  interacted with groups from neighboring regions.</p>
            <h3>The Site</h3>
            <p>The J. B. White site (official designation: 41MM341)  was a camp where a few related families lived, probably during the summer months  when the possibility of flooding of the Little River was low and when access to  the many resources of the floodplain was unlimited. These people hunted deer  and other animals such as raccoons, opossums, and rabbits, all of which would  have been plentiful in the area. At the same time, they collected a wide range  of other foods, including turtles and mussels from the river as well as some  fish and ducks. Also, they gathered up wild onions and land snails and brought them  to the camp from nearby open grassy areas of the prairie. The floodplain forest  and oak woodlands provided nuts and fruits such as pecans, hickories, and plums  along with oak wood, which they  selected especially for fueling their campfires.</p>
            <p>Another thing these Indians did  was make hunting tools using high-quality chert (&quot;flint&quot;) gathered from the Little River  gravel bars. Most of this chert came from the Edwards Plateau, where it crops out along the  Balcones Escarpment and was carried eastward by the river. The tool makers, known as knappers, brought chert cobbles back to the camp and  broke them in systematic ways to fashion mostly arrow points and knife blades. </p>
            <p> Concentrations of stone flakes and chunks along with tools that broke while  they were being made mark at least 10 tool-making episodes that took place at the camp.  Other stone tools recovered from the camp in smaller numbers, such as adzes,  gouges, and choppers, may have been used for working wood and suggest that such  perishable tools as wooden arrow shafts and knife handles also were made on the  site.</p>
            <p>Most cooking and tool making  took place around small hearths built directly on the ground surface. The camp  was a workshop as well as a place of habitation, and it was used in this way  on and off over a period of 700 years based on radiocarbon dates ranging from A.D. 600 to 1300. Flooding of the Little  River occasionally deposited sediment on the campsite, covering and preserving the  remains of each occupation. The camp was used more often between about A.D. 1100 and 1300 than it was before  this. Activity areas that overlap each other mark this increased use, as does  the use  of large cooking or baking pits. A  cluster of 10 large cooking pits ranging from 4 to 6 feet across was found  about 30 feet south of the main activity areas at the camp. These pits were  probably clustered away from the main part of the camp because of the heat and  smoke they generated.</p>
            <p>The J. B. White site was first occupied  during the period when hunters were shifting  from using darts and spear  throwers (atlatls) to the newer bow and arrow weapon system. This can be seen from the fact that the stone points made and used at the site  include Darl dart points and Scallorn arrow points marking the earliest   occupations of the site, and Scallorn, Alba, and  Perdiz arrow points  used later during most of the site&rsquo;s history. Large stone knife blades, called  Gahagan knives, were also part of the hunting tool kit used by the site&rsquo;s  inhabitants. These knife blades were consistently found with all three types of  arrows recovered.</p>            
            <p>The kinds of arrow points  (true &quot;arrowheads&quot;) recovered as well as the kinds of activities and camp features discovered suggest  the people who lived at the J. B. White site were influenced in various ways by  their neighbors. The large number of Alba arrow points, a style  commonly used  by east Texas Caddo groups, in the later occupations of the site suggests  increased contacts in an easterly direction. Whether these contacts involved  simple trade, marriage, actual movement of whole groups of people, political  alliances, or some combination of these is difficult to determine. There is  evidence to suggest that some arrows and knives made at the J. B. White site  were carried away from the site. It is possible that tools fashioned from the  sought-after chert available in the Little River nearby may have been made as  trade items. The Gahagan knife, in particular, is a form that shows up as part  of hunting tool kits in many central Texas  sites and also as offerings in elite Caddo graves at the George C. Davis site  in Cherokee County, Texas.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>In This Exhibit</strong></p>
            <p>The J. B. White site exhibit  provides significant new information for <em>Texas  Beyond History</em> viewers and the archeological community. First, it helps  fill a critical geographical gap. There has been scant archeological research  conducted in east-central Texas. This  exhibit summarizes some of the scientific  data which raise important questions  about patterns of prehistoric life in the region. Second, readers will learn much about  the &ldquo;hows and whys&rdquo; of archeological research, from data recovery using  state-of-the-art excavation techniques to how the results are interpreted. In  the process, we will gain a clearer picture of the life of Indian peoples along the Little River during the Late Prehistoric era.</p>
