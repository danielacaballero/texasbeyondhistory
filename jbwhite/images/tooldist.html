    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->This  indicates that most activities associated with tools usually were performed  close to the hearths and their surrounding debris scatters. The many expedient  tools in these locations probably means that people selected flakes from the  lithic debris piles for immediate use and then discarded them on the spot.  Formal tools such as woodworking tools had more varied use histories. They are  more likely to have been moved away from their place of manufacture or use, and  thus they occur more often around the edges of or just beyond the main parts of  the debris scatters.
Looking  at the individual types of formal tools, it was hard to see patterns suggesting  that people used or discarded different kinds of tools in different places, in  part because of the small numbers of tools within many of the categories. One  pattern may be worth noting, however. Specifically, arrow points and knives and  their preforms occur more consistently within the cores of the debris scatters  than do all other formal tool categories combined (71 vs. 59 percent). This is  probably because arrow points and knives were the two main intended products  that resulted in creation of the stone debris piles, and when they broke during  manufacture they were discarded on the spot.<!-- #EndEditable --></td>
