    <td class="caption"><p class="style1">Unfortunately,  de Vaca did not indicate the kind of snail eaten. Other evidence comes from the  dry cave sites of the Lower Pecos, where bits  of snail shells were found in human coprolites, but again these findings are  inconclusive as to the type of snail. Like most snails,<em> Rabdotus</em> would have  been a source of low-fat protein. Also, they are relatively large and could  have been collected easily in the warm months of the year when they are most  active, and they can be quick-boiled to retrieve their meat. Several Texas archeologists,  including Dr. Tom Hester and T. C. Hill, as reported in their 1975 article in  the publication, <em>Nautilus</em>, have shown through experiments that boiling is the  best means of extracting snail meat.
  As  part of his analysis of the snails recovered from the Smith Creek Bridge site in  DeWitt County, Kenneth M. Brown of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory  provides a comprehensive discussion of the arguments for and against the use of  the <em>Rabdotus</em> snails as food. He concedes that the question will not be totally  resolved until better information about the lifeways of this snail are known.  But, he&nbsp; suggests gathering and comparing  snail samples from archeological sites and from places that are not on sites as  a helpful start in resolving this question. Part of this comparison would  include looking for juvenile snails. It is likely that snails collected by  prehistoric Native Americans would be limited to the large, easily gathered  adult snails. Therefore, archeological samples lacking juvenile snails would  indicate selection for food, while off-site samples should show the natural  frequency of juveniles to adults.
  At  the J. B White site, archeologists collected 12,842<em> Rabdotus</em> snail shells. Most  were mixed within concentrations of freshwater mussel shells, though an  isolated group of 2,734 snails was found and designated Feature 17. An analyst  measured the size of some of the snails from this feature, and this revealed  that almost all of the snails were adults. As suggested by Brown, the field  crew also collected soil samples away from the main refuse deposits at the site  to look for a natural sample of snails. <em>Rabdotus</em> snails were not common within  these samples. Only 29 <em>Rabdotus</em> shells were among the&nbsp; 3,800 snails recovered. Of the <em>Rabdotus</em> identified,  20 were juvenile snails, suggesting that in natural samples juveniles are  likely to outnumber adults. These natural samples indicate that the site area  was never a hospitable habitat for <em>Rabdotus</em> snails. The high numbers of adult  shells in the site features, especially Feature 17, must indicate intentional  collection of snails.
