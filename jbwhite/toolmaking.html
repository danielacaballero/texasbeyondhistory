            <p>An unusual thing about the J. B.  White site is that discrete piles of stone debris from making arrow points and knives  remained intact within the site sediments. These <strong>debris piles</strong> consisted of the flint  flakes and chunks that <strong>flintknappers </strong>(stone tool  makers) generated as waste when they made tools. Also in these piles were  broken, half-finished tools called preforms, and nearly finished tools. The  archeologists found 10 such piles adjacent to some of the  hearths. These artifact concentrations appear  to represent  activities that took place around the hearths. The flint (technically chert) in these  piles started out as river cobbles gathered from nearby gravel beds along the Little River. The stone of the river cobbles  is of good quality and was easily  chipped to form the tools.</p>
            <p>The knappers intentionally broke  cobbles into  large flakes that they could further work  into arrow points. And they removed flakes of stone from both sides of some  cobbles to make larger  stone tools such as knives. The archeologists found broken  arrow points and knives within the debris piles, along with fragments of arrow  and knife preforms,  cores, and expedient flake tools. <strong>Preforms</strong> are well-shaped, but unfinished, bifacial (two-sided) tools. <strong>Cores</strong> are the remains of cobbles from which multiple flakes have been removed. <strong>Expedient flake tools</strong> are simple flakes  of stone whose sharp edges the Indians used for cutting and scraping. Flake  tools are considered &quot;expedient&quot; because the knappers quickly made them as needed with  little  effort and just as quickly discarded them when the task at hand was completed. </p>
            <p>The recovery of both expedient flake  tools and the more &quot;formally&quot; (carefully and laboriously)  shaped arrow points and knives provides direct evidence of the kinds of tool  production that resulted in the debris piles. In fact, 39%  of all the formal stone  tools from the excavation blocks were found within  debris piles. Likewise, 37% of all expedient tools were found amind  debris  piles.</p>
            <p>One of the most pristine   debris  piles was near the top of Zone 2 where 706 chert flakes and chunks were found within a single unit-level (10-centimeter layer within a 1-meter square). The field crew knew that the sheer  quantity of stone debris in this unit-level was unique, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the  laboratory crew washed the debris that they realized that these materials were probably made and  deposited  at more or less the same point in time. Most of this debris could be sorted easily  into groups of light gray, brown, or yellowish brown chert. Groups of debris  could also be separated out based on distinctive crystalline inclusions in the  stone. The color, texture, and inclusions of the stone debris allowed researchers to trace the debris pile  across six adjacent 1-meter squares.</p>
            <p>Nine  other unit-levels yielded  some 300&ndash;500 pieces of debris each and were considered to represent the central areas  of individual debris  piles. The stone debris piles covered areas ranging from 5 to 14 square meters (54 to 150 square feet). This analysis revealed that the 10 debris piles were  fairly intact and that they had not been jumbled or mixed with debris from  earlier or later occupations. </p>
            <p>When  analyst Eloise Gadus matched like debris  and cores, she found that each debris pile consisted of an average of at least  14 cobbles. The debris piles do not in themselves represent single  stone tool making  episodes. Rather, the large sizes of some of them, the likely  presence of many more cobbles than the analyst could actually identify, and the  mixture of various kinds of tool-making strategies represented by each pile  indicate that they are the result of multiple episodes of tool manufacture,  albeit ones that happened over limited time spans or within single occupational  episodes. </p>
            <p>Since the debris piles were fairly  intact, it can be assumed that other concentrations of materials, such as  animal bones and shells, that overlap or are adjacent to the piles are also  fairly intact. This was a critical finding. As will be explained further in the next exhibit  section, all of these concentrations represent activities that  occurred near camp hearths. In this way, the stone debris piles provide some of  the best evidence for the integrity of the campsite and for determining the  kind of activities that took place around the camp.  </p>
          <p>Finally, the debris piles show what  kinds of tools the knappers made. Arrow points and knives were most important.  However, it is also clear that some tools that had already been in use were resharpened there in preparation for  the next hunt. Also, these were places where people had struck expedient flake  tools from cobble cores, used them, and then discarded them. These kinds of  information help provide a picture of the patterns of daily life at the camp. </p>

Gadus did it by spreading out all the groups of like materials  from each debris pile and trying to fit pieces of each group back together.
