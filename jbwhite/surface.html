            <p>In a 1937 article entitled &ldquo;Milam County,  The Future Field for Archeologists&rdquo; published in a small journal called the <em>Central Texas Archeologist</em>, avocational  archeologist J. B. White wrote of his expeditions through the area and reported  on the sites he had discovered. He spoke of &ldquo;numerous villages&rdquo; and campsites  along stream banks and wondered about the ancient peoples that &ldquo;time had erased  from the prairies.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>His methods were unsophisticated: White was an  artifact collector&mdash;on a very large scale&mdash;as were many of his era, yet he  recognized the value of and need for archeological research in this significant  region. &nbsp;Today, more than half a century  later, few of the sites he discovered are known to archeologists,  and even fewer have been professionally excavated. Many have been destroyed by the continuing development of rural and urban areas. Many others have been dug up by artifact collectors out of curiousity and sometimes just plain greed. </p>
            <p>Yet some sites in the area survive more or less intact and still have the potential to yield badly needed scientific data. We can only hope that concerned landowners will continue to protect some archeological sites for the future. The science of archeology continues to develop new and improved ways of excavating and analyzing prehistoric sites. Perhaps one day proper  excavations will take place at a series of these surviving  sites. Such work would   fill in the many gaps in our understanding of the prehistory of the Little  River region and provide greater insights into the connections between  the Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherers of central Texas and the contemporary agricultural villagers who settled the the Pineywoods of east Texas. </p>
            <p>Some of the larger &ldquo;Indian villages&rdquo; noted by Mr. White almost certainly  date to the same  time period as the J. B. White site, and they must include the places where the  people lived and visited when not at the J. B. White site. Excavations at these villages  would provide information that could complete the picture of prehistoric life  along the Little River that work at the J. B. White site has just barely  scratched the surface of. Much remains to be discovered or rediscovered and thoughtfully brought to scientific and public attention.</p>
