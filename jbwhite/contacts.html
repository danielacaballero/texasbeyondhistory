            <p>Archeologists often are asked  questions about who the prehistoric peoples they study actually were and what  happened to them. Such  questions can be partially answered by looking  at contacts and connections among neighboring groups. This can be done, given the lack of written records,  by comparing how people in different areas lived  and by comparing the  kinds of artifacts they created. With these kinds of comparisons, even a small  campsite such as the J. B. White site can help flesh out the story of how the people who lived  there interacted with others. </p>
            <p>The J. B. White site represents a  small slice of a way of life that the people who lived along the Little River  and its tributaries followed for at least 700 years, from about A.D. 600 to 1300. These native peoples  possessed a hunting tool kit consisting of the bow and arrow and knives, they  used large and small   pits and surface hearths for cooking, and they relied  on a variety of animal and plant foods. Evidence of this lifeway also has been   documented at the few other excavated sites in the Little River drainage that are of  similar age as the J. B. White site. Two of these are the <strong>Hoxie  Bridge site</strong> and the <strong>Loeve-Fox site,</strong>  both of which are located along the San Gabriel  River in Williamson County.  The strong similarities between these sites suggest that the people who created  them were part of the same population local to this region.</p>
            <p>The tools and stone debris they left at the J.  B. White and Hoxie   Bridge sites, in  particular, indicate that crafting stone hunting tools was important to the  people who lived there, and that they were especially masterful at making arrow  points and knife blades. The styles of these hunting tools changed through  time, and these changes provide evidence of the strong connections these people  had to central Texas as well as clues about  contacts they had with people who lived outside the central Texas region.</p>
            <p>The deepest  and thus earliest levels  of the excavations at the J. B. White site dating to about A.D. 650 produced several <strong>Darl dart  points</strong> along with <strong>Scallorn arrow points</strong>. These likely mark the transition from  use of the atlatl and dart for hunting to the bow and arrow. Darl points were  common to the eastern margin of the Edwards   Plateau and indicate  long-held connections between groups on the Blackland Prairie and those to the  west. The work of Clell Bond   at the Hoxie Bridge site and  Elton Prewitt at Loeve-Fox showed that Darl dart points eventually were replaced by  Scallorn arrow points. Scallorn arrow points were made and used throughout the  occupations at the J. B. White site, but they were used most frequently between  A.D. 900 and 1100. After that,  until about A.D. 1300, <strong>Alba arrow  points</strong> were made and used most frequently, and by the end of the site&rsquo;s occupation Alba points  and a few Perdiz-like points were the predominant arrow point styles.</p>
            <p>Alba points are also well  represented at the Hoxie   Bridge site but not so at  Loeve-Fox. Alba points are found often at sites in east Texas  and are most-famously associated with the <strong>George C. Davis site</strong> in Cherokee County,  where Dee Ann Story of the University of Texas at Austin and her crew discovered them   en masse  as burial offerings. The fact that the people who lived at the J. B. White site  made and used Alba points suggests that they were in contact with the east  Texas Caddo groups who built the burial mound at the Davis site.</p>
            <p>What strengthens this tie is the  fact that the <strong>Perdiz arrow points</strong> from the J. B. White site are not like other  Perdiz points from central Texas,  which have long stems and deep barbs. Rather, they are more similar to ones  that are often found along the western margins of east Texas and that are well made with shorter  stems and barbs. Archeologists have found such short-stemmed Perdiz points at  the <strong>McGuire&rsquo;s Garden site</strong> located in Freestone    County, Texas. This  site, investigated by Prewitt and Associates for the Jewett Mine, was likely a  Caddo hamlet dating to about A.D. 1300, or right at the end of the time the J. B. White site was occupied. Some  researchers such as  Harry Shafer consider these short-stemmed Perdiz to  be the east Texas  type <strong>Bonham arrow points</strong>. The presence of these eastern Perdiz or Bonham points along with  the Alba points at the J. B. White site indicates strong eastern connections.</p>
            <p>The chipped stone knives recovered  from the J. B. White site also tell us something about connections between  peoples. Several knife types have been defined by archeologists based on blade  and base shape. The types found at the J. B. White and Hoxie Bridge  sites include the <strong>Friday knife</strong> and the <strong>Gahagan knife</strong>. The Friday knife is found  mostly in central Texas.  It has convex to straight blade edges and a generally straight base. The  Gahagan knife, with recurved blade edges that flare near a concave base, is  known best from east Texas Caddo mound sites, though it is also found on  central Texas  habitation sites. Actually, both knife forms appear to have been made and used  at the same time, and both occur at the same sites, such as J. B. White.</p>
            <p>The classic Gahagan knife was first  identified in the early 1900s by Clarence Bloomfield Moore during his  excavation of the <strong>Gahagan mound site</strong> located along the Red River in western Louisiana. The knife  type was given the name of the site where it was first identified. However,  Gahagan knives both at the George C. Davis site and the the Gahagan site appear  to have been fashioned from central Texas  chert. This fact, along with the appearance of similar-shaped knives on  habitation sites in central Texas, suggests  that Gahagan knives were made by central Texas  groups who traded them to the east Texas Caddo. Caddo Indians living at sites  such as George C. Davis in turn may have traded the finely crafted knife blades to their  relatives in what is now Louisiana.</p>
            <p>The importance of Alba arrow points  and Gahagan knives to Caddo peoples is underscored by their occurrence as  burial offerings. During her 1968&ndash;1970 excavations at the  Davis site,  Story discovered clusters of Alba points, as if in quivers, within  two burials of important people in Mound C. Another cluster of Alba points, as  if in a basket, along with several Gahagan knives was found with offerings set  with a burial at the very base of the mound. These Alba points, made of chert  from central Texas,  varied in shape enough to suggest that they represent collections of arrows  from multiple makers. In fact, several of them are very close in style and  workmanship to the Alba points recovered from the J. B. White site. This does  not mean that the Alba points at the Davis site had to have been made at the J.  B. White site, although they might have been, but they almost certainly were  made by people who lived somewhere in the Little River drainage. If these  people did not actually visit J. B. White on occasion, they knew people who  did.</p>
            <p>Alba points and Gahagan knives were  not just traded away, though. The people who lived at the J. B. White site also  made these tools for their own use, as demonstrated by the many points and  knives broken in use and discarded there. That people used these particular  tools both for hunting and as an asset for trade suggests that the &ldquo;style&rdquo; of  points and knives was more than just a matter of simple function. In this case,  it looks like the styles of the tools the Little River Indians made were  dictated at least partly by what the Caddo Indians wanted.</p>
            <p><strong>What  did the people who lived at the J. B. White site get in return for their  well-made arrows and knives?</strong> This question is difficult to answer because  many kinds of things that could have been traded, such as salt or bear fat, are  perishable and leave no physical traces. But one benefit of trade between  people of the Little River area and the Caddo may have been the creation of  alliances between different groups of people. Such alliances could have helped  prevent conflict between these groups, or between them and their other  neighbors, from getting out of hand. One reason archeologists think there was  conflict during this time period in this part of Texas is that evidence of violent death  sometimes shows up. For example,  Prewitt discovered a small cemetery  at the Loeve-Fox site in Williamson   County, and of the 12  people buried there, several had arrow points imbedded in their backs. Violent  deaths like these indicate that conflict and aggression were present within the  region that included the J. B. White site.</p>
            <p>Such alliances may even be reflected  in the arrow points found with the burials of important people at the George C.  Davis site. The arrows at the Davis  site appear to be from many different makers collected into single quivers.  These quivers may symbolize the power of alliances to quell conflicts between  different groups of people. These alliances could have been what eventually  enabled large congregations of people to come together from east and central Texas for trade fairs  and other activities. This type of interaction is known to have occurred in  historic times when eastern groups such as the Hasinai Caddo came west to the  Balcones Escarpment to trade and hunt bison, and there is no reason to think  it did not happen several hundred years earlier when Native Americans lived at  J. B. White as well.</p>
            <p><strong>So who where the people who lived at  the J. B. White site and what happened to them? </strong>It looks like they were local  folk who had roamed the Little River drainage from the Brazos  River west to the margin of the Edwards Plateau for many, many years. In fact,  their ancestors may have done this for thousands of years. They used the same  kinds of tools and exploited the same kinds of resources in the same ways as  their central Texas  neighbors, but they also had ties with east Texas Caddo groups who built the  George C. Davis site mounds. These ties were likely cemented by the trade in certain kinds of arrow points and knives, and the willingness of  the people along the Little River to satisfy the desires of their trading  partners. &nbsp;With a little luck, those  interactions with folks far afield helped the people living on the Little River  maintain their territory and smooth any difficulties they encountered with  their neighbors. </p>
            <p>We do not know what happened to  these people. They stopped using the J. B. White site hundreds of years before  European explorers, missionaries, and traders came to this part of the New World. Maybe their descendants were among the Indians  the first Europeans met, or maybe they had already moved out of the area by  then to make room for other Native American groups. Some archeologists think  the latter may have been the case, but that is not part of the story the J. B.  White site has to tell.</p>

Dr. Harry J. Shafer, who originally analyzed these specimens, found that  the high-quality chert from which they were made was not local to east Texas. The chert was  light gray, tan, brown, and tannish brown. &nbsp;Shafer also pointed out that the large sizes  of the knives indicated that they had been made from large river cobbles or  chert slabs from bedrock sources, and that the makers of the knives probably  lived close to the chert sources. These kinds of chert can be found in gravel  bars in the Little River near the J. B. White site, and there is no doubt that  the knappers who lived there had the skills to make the tools that  archeologists call Gahagans. Photograph courtesy of Harry J. Shafer.</em></div></td>
