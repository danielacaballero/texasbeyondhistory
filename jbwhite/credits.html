                  <p class="text">The J. B. White Site exhibit was created by <strong>Eloise Frances Gadus</strong>. Gadus is a research archeologist who has worked for Prewitt and Associates, Inc., for over 18 years. She is an expert in the prehistoric Native American societies of east Texas and the Gulf Coast. This interest grew out of her undergraduate research assistantship at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History of Ohio where she was introduced to the prehistory of the Southeastern United States. She also gained experience in the field of Cultural Resource Management by working for the University of West Florida at Pensacola in both Florida and Mississippi and from her graduate studies at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Gadus directed operations at the J. B. White site, and <strong>Jennifer McWilliams</strong> served as Project Archeologist.
McWilliams, who has participated in historic and prehistoric archological projects in Belize, Ecuador, Peru, and Texas, holds a BA in Anthropology from Southwest Texas State University and MA in Anthropology from Texas Tech University. She has been with Prewitt and Associates., Inc., for the past five years. 
                  <p class="text"><strong>Ross Field</strong>s is Principal Investigator for the J. B. White site project and co-author, with Gadus and Karl Kibler, of the forthcoming (2006) report detailing the results of their analysis of the site. Fields is President of <strong>Prewitt and Associates, Inc., </strong>an Austin-based firm that provides archeological and historical consulting services to federal and state agencies, local governments, private industry, and individuals. He holds bachelor's and master's degrees in anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin. Before joining Prewitt and Associates as a Staff Archeologist in 1981, he honed his archeological skills on a variety of projects in places such as east Texas, northeastern Oklahoma, southeastern Alaska, and the Four Corners region of the Southwest. Although he has worked on a variety of projects throughout Texas, his strongest research interests lie in east Texas, having been fostered by a 1975 field school with Dee Ann Story at Deshazo, a protohistoric Caddo hamlet west of Nacogdoches, and work in 1977 and 1980 at the George C. Davis site.
