            <p>The planned replacement of a highway bridge  spanning part of the wide, nearly flat Little River floodplain led to the archeological investigation of the J. B. White site and two  other nearby prehistoric sites. This section explains  how the archeological research  unfolded  in advance of bridge construction.</p>
            <p>All planned  road construction  activities by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) are evaluated for their potential to affect sites important to the  history and prehistory of the United    States. Staff archeologists from TxDOT's  Archeological Studies  Program of the Environmental Affairs Division do these initial evaluations.    TxDOT  examined the  bridge replacement project area. They  noted that the part of the  project area within the river floodplain was cut by many sloughs and abandoned  channels of the river. These kinds of natural features suggest a long history of  intermittent  flooding. During such floods, the river sometimes changes course and cuts a new channel  leaving behind an abandoned channel that slowly fills  with sediment from  later floods. Floods can preserve archeological sites along these abandoned channels by  quickly burying them. It was obvious that the Littler River floodplain needed to be probed along the planned bridge route to search for buried prehistoric sites that might be associated with  these old channels.</p>
            <p>In 1999, TxDOT archeologists employed  a backhoe to probe  the  nearly two-mile-long project corridor through the valley and look for sites buried by  flood deposits. They oversaw the excavation of  28  backhoe trenches. Twelve of these trenches encountered artifacts and other evidence marking three  prehistoric sites (see graphic at top of page). Site 41MM339 was found to be 11  feet or more below the modern surface on the edge of an old channel that was itself buried. Though this site appeared to be important, it was deep enough to  escape damage from bridge construction, and thus no further investigation was needed. However, sites 41MM340 and 41MM341 (now known as the J. B. White site) yielded archeological evidence buried from 1 to 6 feet below the surface of the modern floodplain. Both sites were judged to have important research potential. They produced stone tools and  considerable  debris from making stone tools, as well as animal  bones, mussel shells, and well-defined fireplaces built by Native Americans.  Since these sites would be  disturbed by the planned bridge  construction, they were recommended for further study.</p>
            <p>Part of the both the initial evaluation and later investigation involved  what is known as <strong>geoarcheological investigation, </strong>the application of geological techniques to address  archeological problems. In this case, the archeologists needed to  understand how the Little River floodplain had formed over time  to  determine where the river was when the sites were occupied and how they may  have become buried. Specialists with strong geological training  carefully studied and sampled the walls of each backhoe trench (and later excavation units). Gradually they unraveled the sequence of flood terrace formation and used radiocabon dating to determine when each period of soil formation and channel cutting had occured. </p>
            <p>These geoarcheological investigations determined  that the archeological  remains at the J. B. White site and other nearby sites occur  within buried soils formed on a series of  floodplain  surfaces on which people had lived. These old soils in the vicinity of the sites  were cut by several sloughs or old channels of the Little River. The river apparently had  moved to near  its present position by the time the J. B. White site was occupied.</p>
            <H3>Test Excavations</H3>
            <p>Following the initial evaluation, the next stage in the research   process consisted of  digging a series of small test pits by hand  at 41MM340 and the J. B. White site, the  two sites that would be affected by bridge construction. This <strong>testing phase</strong> was   carried out in 2000 by  a team from the  <strong>Center for Archaeological Research</strong> (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio working for  TxDOT. Eventually, the CAR archeologists would go on to carry out major excavations at  41MM340, but that&rsquo;s another story. Their testing of  the J. B. White site  involved reopening several of the previously dug backhoe trenches followed by the hand excavation of two small areas  (&quot;blocks&quot;) measuring 2-x-2 meters (about 6-x-6 feet) off of  those trenches, as well as  121 auger tests across the site. Two trenches, both in the  northern part of the site, had encountered<strong> hearths </strong>(firepits)  and  <strong>midden deposits </strong>(concentrations of prehistoric garbage). The  two small testing blocks  allowed the CAR archeologists to recognize and define three  cultural zones and five hearth features.</p>
            <p>The three cultural zones reflected  the sequence of occupations at the site. For instance,  <strong>Zone 1</strong> extending from the surface to 40 centimeters (1.3 feet)  deep encompassed the remains of an apparent  prehistoric garbage  pit and a small concentration of chipped stone artifacts. Charcoal from that  pit produced a radiocarbon date  with a range of A.D.  1407&ndash;1440. In addition, 11 sherds from pottery vessels came 30  centimeters (1 foot) below the surface. These discoveries suggested that the archeological evidence in Zone 1 may have been left behind by  the Toyah culture, people who lived in central Texas from A.D. 1300-1600 just before the arrival of the first Spanish explorers.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Toyah culture</strong> is the name  archeologists have given to groups of people who lived mainly west of the J. B.  White site on the Edwards   Plateau during  the Late Prehistoric period. But Toyah  peoples sometimes ranged into the coastal prairies and often occupied sites  eastward beyond the edge of the plateau and out onto the Blackland Prairie. They were buffalo and deer hunters, but they also took a  wide range of other game and collected many plant foods.   However, as the investigation of the  J. B. White site progressed, it was determined that the  occupational remains in Zone 1 were so sparse that they could not tell  us much about how Toyah peoples used the site. </p>
            <p>Cultural <strong>Zone 2</strong>, which is older than Zone 1, started at  about 40 centimeters below the surface and extended to 70 centimeters (1.3-2.3 feet). Mussel shells and many chipped stone artifacts marked this zone along  with cooking pit features, including two large  baking pits. Radiocarbon dates on charcoal from the bottom of  the mussel shell concentration and one of the baking pits show that the zone formed in two occupational episodes dating to about  A.D.  685&ndash;780 and A.D. 1020&ndash;1160.</p>
            <p>The people who left the artifacts recovered from Zone 2 remain unnamed. But they lived during the  period in central Texas  (A.D. 700-1300)  when Native American groups, depending on a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle, adopted the bow and arrow. The shift from the atlatl and dart to the bow and arrow was a change in weapon technology that occurred across all of North America. Locally, the change is marked by the occurence of small side-notched triangular arrowpoints known as Scallorn points. At the J. B. White site these points are found in association with distinctive types of stone tools known as  Gahagan or Friday knives. This period of change also is marked by the introduction of ceramic technology&#8212;the making of earthenware pottery vessels. However, though small numbers of potsherds (fragments of ceramic  vessels)  were found at the site, most were associated with Zone 1 and none could be unquestionably related to the occupation represented in Zone 2. This fact suggests that pottery was not an important part of the cooking technology of the people. </p>
            <p>Cultural <strong>Zone 3</strong>, the oldest and deepest zone, was  recognized at a depth of  90&ndash;110 centimeters (3.0&ndash;3.6 feet) in both blocks, but  especially in Block 2. The archeologists found artifacts in smaller numbers to  a depth of 160 centimeters (5.2 feet). During the testing phase, the age of Zone 3 was not precisely  determined, as no radiocarbon dates were obtained. However, Zone 3 was thought to represent occupations dating to the Late Archaic period similar in age to those  investigated at nearby site 41MM340. Later excavations determined that  Zone 3 does indeed represent occupations dating to A.D.  600 to 800, the waning centuries of the Late Archaic period.</p>
            <H3>Major Excavations: Targeting Zone 2</H3>
            <p>Based on the CAR testing, the Zone 2 occupations at J. B. White were targeted for more intensive research. Testing  had  shown  that the archeological evidence in Zone 2 would allow researchers to  address some basic questions about the region's prehistory, some  of which have tantalizingly elusive answers. First, were the people who lived  at the J. B. White site the same people who frequented the nearby Edwards Plateau  to the west before the Toyah folk? If not, did these people  make a  living in the same way as those early folks before Toyah on the Edwards Plateau? In other words, did these people practice  the same  kinds of hunting and cooking technologies as their close neighbors to the west, and  did they eat the same kinds of animals and plants? Answers to these questions  could help explain how the J. B. White site fits into the overall picture  of how prehistoric Native Americans used the Little River valley. For instance,  did people live there for short stays (a few days) or longer periods (a few  months)? How  many people lived there, and how often did they return? And did the ways they  used the site change over time? (Visit the TBH exhibit, <a href="../plateaus/index.html">Prehistoric Peoples of the Plateaus and Canyonlands</a> to learn about life on the Edwards Plateau.) </p>
            <p>A difficult but fascinating  question  is how people at the J. B. White site interacted with the early farming peoples to the east, the Caddo villagers  of east Texas.  One hypothesis proposed by archeologist Dr. Harry J. Shafer argues  that Caddo peoples  lived at sites like J. B. White to take advantage of the rich resources of  the Blackland Prairies and Oak Woodlands in order to help support large ceremonial  centers in their east Texas  homeland. (Visit  the <a href="../tejas/index.html">Tejas exhibits</a> on TBH to learn all  about the Caddo peoples).</p>
            <p>To answer these kinds of research questions, archeologists  needed different kinds of information.  They would need  large  samples of artifacts such as stone tools as well as other campsite debris such  as animal bones, mussel shells, burned rocks, burned clay, and charred wood and  other plant remains. And they would need information on <strong>context </strong>and  <strong>associations</strong>: how the artifacts and other materials were distributed across the  site in relation to features such as cooking hearths and baking pits. To  collect these kinds of data, large-scale excavations had to be done.</p>
            <p>The <strong>excavation phase</strong> was carried out by a research team from <strong>Prewitt and Associates, Inc.</strong>, an Austin-based archeological consulting firm under contract with TxDOT.  The research team had extensive  experience excavating sites of similar age to the east in the Oak Woodlands of  Freestone and Leon   Counties, and they knew  that for such a large excavation they would need a crew of 8 to 10 people for  about three months. </p>
            <p>The crew assembled was a diverse  group of professional archeologists who had trained at many different institutions  of higher learning. This crew shouldered all the heavy lifting while  implementing the science. And the heavy lifting was considerable, since the  crew excavated 95 cubic meters (3,354 cubic feet) of dense clay loam, which  they shoveled into buckets. Each bucket of the clay-rich soil had to be soaked in a solution of baking soda and water to  dissolve the clay so it could be washed through screens from which the small artifacts were recovered. Crew members  lifted about  11,400 buckets of this slurry into screens to recover artifacts and other  cultural materials. This is the equivalent of lifting   the weight of at least  28 Chevrolet Suburbans, bucket by bucket. Real archeological work requires lots of  hardwork and keen attention to small details.</p>          </td>

            <p>Work began in the steamy month of  July, 2002. CAR&rsquo;s testing blocks and several previously excavated backhoe trenches were reopened. (Archeologists must backfill excavations between investigation phases for safety and to reduce the chance that thoughtless tresspassers would  disturb the work.) An additional trench was dug to better isolate the targeted area. Hand excavations began with eleven <strong>1-meter squares</strong> &#8212; single excavation units measuring 1-x-1 meter (about 3-x-3 feet). Each unit was placed adjacent to  a  reopened trench to take advantage of the &quot;side view&quot; provided by the trench wall. This work revealed previously undiscovered concentrations of mussel shells, burned clay,  bones, and stone debris. These discoveries were combined with the results of earlier testing to plot   the distributions of  artifacts and deposits across the site and guide the large-scale excavations. </p>
            <p>Each of the   1-meter squares  was  excavated through all three cultural zones, and the results  confirmed that only one zone merited further investigation.  Within  Zone 1, four units yielded only a few artifacts, not  enough to answer our research questions. Zone 3 produced more artifacts, but  a dart point from it suggested that these materials were similar to those   recovered from 41MM340, the nearby site that CAR had just excavated. There was little need to  duplicate  information from that site. Therefore, the remainder of the work at the J. B. White site  targeted  Zone 2 and the early Late Prehistoric materials it contains.</p>
            <p>To speed up the excavations,  a backhoe and  a Gradall provided by TxDOT were used to  remove Zone 1 from the central part of the site. This technique, known as <strong>stripping </strong>or <strong>overburden removal</strong>, allowed archeologists to concentrate excavation effort on Zone 2. After the stripping was completed,  excavation blocks were begun in three areas, each consisting of groups of adjoining 1-meter squares.</p>
            <p>After excavations began in the  <strong>Main  Block</strong>, the archeologists began to find many concentrations of freshwater  mussel shells and land snail shells. These occcured   as  patchy areas that also contained burned  clay, burned rocks, lithic tools, debitage, animal bones, and charcoal. These  patches were 2-5 meters (6 to 16 feet) across but only a few inches thick. </p>
            <p>The  crew excavated each 1-meter square in <strong>unit-levels</strong> 10 centimeters (4 inches) thick. Several archeologists dug  adjacent squares more or less side-by-side, so that a broad area was exposed at the same level. This allowed them to open up big areas and map the concentrations of shells and other artifacts.  Importantly, these large horizontal exposures enabled the crew to begin to see how artifacts  were distributed around fireplaces, baking pits, and other features. Because of  the many features and artifacts encountered, the Main Block eventually was  expanded to cover 170 square meters (1,829 square feet).</p>
            <p>After the Main Block was well under  way, two smaller blocks were started to determine whether, as expected, the people who lived at the site  did different kinds of things in different parts of the site. The <strong>East Block</strong>  covered 12 square meters (129 square feet), while the <strong>South Block</strong> covered 28 square meters (301  square feet). The East Block produced   materials similar to those in the Main Block, although in lower frequencies, suggesting  that similar kinds of activities had taken place  there. The South Block proved to be unique,   because it revealed a series of large overlapping baking pits filled with  burned rocks, burned clay, charcoal, and little else. These large pits,  measuring 1.3&ndash;2.0 meters ( 4.3&ndash;6.6 feet) across and 18&ndash;44  centimeters (0.6&ndash;1.4 feet) deep, were not encountered anywhere else on the site.</p>
            <p>Forty-eight cultural <strong>features</strong> directly related to human  activities were identified in  the excavations at the J. B. White site. These include shell concentrations, burned rock concentrations, pit  hearths, surface hearths, and large baking pits. Some of the dirt (<strong>soil matrix</strong>) from each  feature was specially processed using a <strong>flotation</strong> machine to recover tiny  bones, snail shells, and charred seeds that could help the archeologists figure out how  Native Americans used these features. Other samples were collected from features  for specialized analyses. For example,  some &quot;burned&quot; rocks (cooking stones) from hearths and baking pits were set aside for <strong>lipid analysis</strong>. This technique  can identify organic  residues that can help pinpoint  the kinds of plant and animal foods that were being cooked. Burned clay samples were collected for  <strong>diatom analysis</strong>. Diatoms are single-celled  plants that live in water and soils; the presence of different diatom species helps determine whether the  climate  was wet or dry. Charred plant remains (charcoal fragments) were collected  for <strong>macrobotanical analysis </strong>(species identification) as well as   <strong>radiocarbon dating</strong>.</p>
            <p>The quantities of artifacts and  other materials recovered from the J. B. White excavations far exceeded the numbers that were estimated based on  the testing done in 2000. The vast majority of the artifacts are <strong>debitage</strong> &#8212; pieces of  stone left over from stone tool making. Over 37,000 pieces of debitage were  found. Also recovered were 139 arrow points, 18 dart points, and 55 knives. The  knives, darts, and arrows were part of a hunting tool kit that was made at the  site and used by hunters in the surrounding area. Other kinds of stone tools  found in much smaller numbers include  2 drills, 3 awls, 4 gravers, 8 adzes, 2  wedges, 10 gouges, 3 hammerstones, 6 choppers, and 4 hammerstone/choppers. Most  of these are specialized tools mainly used to  work wood, including fashioning the wooden  arrow shafts and knife handles needed for the hunting tool kit.</p>
            <p>In contrast to  the large number of stone tools, only 30 bone tools and worked bone fragments  were recovered. This is due partly to the fact that bone tools are more likely  to decay and thus less likely to last than stone tools. But it also  demonstrates the overwhelming emphasis on making stone tools at the site. Most  of the bone tools appear to have been fashioned from the leg bones or antlers  of white-tailed deer. These include 3 antler tip punches or flakers, 1 worked  antler burr, and parts of 5 ulna tools, all of which were probably used in  making stone tools. Bone tools used for other purposes consist of a single bird  bone bead fragment, 4 awl fragments, 4 needle fragments, 5 worked deer  metacarpal fragments, and 7 tool shaft fragments fashioned from long bones and  likely parts of awls or needles. Eight sandstone abraders also were recovered  and may have been used in making bone tools.</p>
