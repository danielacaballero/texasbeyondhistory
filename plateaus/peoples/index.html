        <td width="372" valign="top"><p>Like whispers on the wind, the many names
            of native groups that roamed the Texas Plateaus and Canyonlands
            are haunting in their strangeness, the ephemeral reminders of a vastly
            different,  yet relatively recent, time. The Historic
            Period  was a time of conflict and
            cultural upheaval for Texas' native groups, as new peoples&mdash;both
            Indian and European&mdash;pushed into the area, intent on establishing
            a presence, exploiting natural resources, or, in many cases, fleeing
            in the advance of aggressors.</p>
          <p> Some relative newcomers to the region,
              such as the Apache, Comanche, and Kiowa, were established, aggressive
              and large enough to withstand the depredations brought on by forced
              migration and European diseases. But hundreds of smaller groups native to the region were
              pushed about and preyed upon to the point of extinction.</p>
          <p> Today, the names and fleeting accounts of some of these native groups, dutifully recorded by Spanish explorers,
                missionaries, and government officials, are all
                that remain today of what must have been a rich and colorful tapestry
                of cultures. </p>          
          <p>During the Historic Period (the time of <strong>written</strong> records;
            beginning roughly in the mid-1500s in the region), literally hundreds of groups
            of native peoples were in flux across the southeastern United States
            and in the area that is now Texas and northern Mexico. </p>
          <p>Explorers, missionaries, and government officials, scouting new
            territory for Spain and France, encountered band after band of
            native peoples in the area that is now Texas. Scribes and soldiers
            enlivened their official diaries and journals with descriptions of
            the aboriginal peoples and their lifestyles. Spanish priests lived
            or traveled among some of the groups and, at mission outposts, compiled
            long lists of the natives who they baptized and hoped to convert
            to Christianity and a settled lifeway. Some observers made note of the natural resources that the Indians
            hunted and gathered, even as they were being taught to grow corn
            and other crops at the missions. </p>
          <p>Accounts such as these provide brief
              but often compelling glimpses of the myriad native groups traversing
              the region. Limited and culturally biased though these records may
              be, they nonetheless contain the earliest written accounts of native
              peoples practicing traditional lifeways in what is now Texas. They
              are, in effect, our bridge from the near-present to the prehistoric
              past&mdash;in some cases, the eye-witness accounts of the activities
              we see represented in artifacts and archeological sites.</p>
          <p>By the 1670s, the Apache were pushing south off the Southern Plains
            due to Comanche intrusion into Apache territory, further altering
            the cultural landscape. This pattern&mdash;interlopers moving into
            territory occupied by others&mdash;can be seen time and again in
            the history of the native peoples of Texas after contact. The disruption
            of native lands, along with epidemics, and other disastrous effects
            of colonization, resulted in the loss of  many of these groups.  In other cases, groups found comfort in joining
            other larger groups&mdash;even the Apache. And, in some cases, people
            moved to remote regions of northern Mexico and later became part
            of the population that still occupies those lands today. For all these reasons, dozens of native groups dropped from sight in a relatively short period, their names absent in later reports written by  Spanish priests and soldiers.</p>
          <p> TxDOT archeologist Nancy
            Kenmotsu and University of Texas anthropologist Mariah Wade have intensively researched the southwest portion of the
            Plateaus and Canyonlands region to produce an ethnohistory of the
            Amistad Recreation area. They also reviewed numerous late period archeological
            sites in the region, particularly those with arrow points, stone
            tipi rings, or historic rock art which might be linked to historically
            documented native encampments. The results of their work, compiled
            in a 2002 report, provide much of the data for
            this exhibit. Wade also has researched the native groups of the Edwards Plateau, mining the relatively few accounts of explorers and priests who traversed the region for insights about these little-known peoples. </p>
          <p>Their findings show that well into the Historic Period, native groups of the Plateaus and Canyonlands
            region continued practicing a traditional hunting-gathering, mobile lifeway, subsisting
            on the varied plants and animals of the plateau and desert lands
            to the west, and making periodic forays into neighboring areas to
            hunt bison or harvest fruits and nuts in season. Several known groups
            who frequented the area, including the Jumano and Apache, were known
            to have periodically planted crops along the Nueces and other rivers to supplement their diet.</p>
          <p>That hunting and gathering continued to be the predominate lifeway, however, points up the  skillful and ingenious adaptation strategies practiced by native peoples over thousands of years in the Plateaus and Canyonlands. </p>
          <p> The following sections provide a brief look at three of the region&rsquo;s
            native groups: <a href="gueiqesale.html">Gueiquesale</a>, <a href="kiowa.html">Kiowa</a>,
            and <a href="apache.html">Apache</a>. Two&mdash;the
            Apache and Kiowa&mdash;were able to withstand, by various means,
            the forces that drove other groups to extinction. Today, they still
            maintain certain tribal identities and work to preserve traditional
            customs. Less successful, the Gueiquesale were devastated
            by disease and other pressures and ultimately faded into history,
            like most of the hundreds of native groups who once roamed Texas.</p>
          <p>The Native Peoples exhibits begin with <a href="records.html">Making
              Sense of the Evidence: Old Records and Archeological Remains</a>,
              a look at the various types of information used to form a picture
              of the native peoples and their lifestyles several hundred years
              ago. Sections on the <a href="gueiqesale.html">Gueiquesale</a>, <a href="kiowa.html">Kiowa</a>,
            and <a href="apache.html">Apache</a> offer readers a cross-section
            of the variety and uniqueness of the Native American stories and
            a view on how these groups accommodated&mdash;or failed to accommodate&mdash;change,
              as the Spanish and later Anglo-Europeans came to settle in their
              homelands. The <a href="credits.html">Credits &amp; Sources</a> section
               lists provides sources consulted during research and suggestions for further reading.</p>
          <p>Additional information on Texas&rsquo; native peoples is available in several other exhibits on <em>Texas Beyond History. </em>The <a href="../index.html">Historic
            Encounters</a> layer of the main Plateaus and Canyonlands

            Prehistoric Texas Project will examine other historic native groups
            in adjacent regions of the state, including the Comanche
            and Jumano (who also ranged over portions of the Plateaus and Canyonlands),
            as well as more localized groups, such as the Coalhuiltecans of the
            Rio Grande Plains and the Alabama Coushatta and Karankawa of the
            Texas coastal areas. </p>
