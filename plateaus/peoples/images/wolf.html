   According to one Kiowa interviewed about Plains customs, while “one man would sometimes kill three buffalo at a run, Lone Wolf would kill 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 - with arrows; when the buffalo did not scatter out too much, if he was in the middle of the herd, he would kill a buffalo on each side of him - that is pretty hard to do to kill a buffalo on the right side - When standing on the ground Lone Wolf could kill a deer at 100 yards - all Kiowa know how well he shot arrows, nobody equaled him - I have seen him kill an antelope with an arrow both running - at fifty yards - he was very skillful. --From Papers of Cavalry Commander Hugh Lennox Scott, Library of Congress.
