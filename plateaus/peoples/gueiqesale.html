        <td valign="top"><br/>
        <p>The Gueiquesale (pronounced guey-kay-sally) were one of the large native groups
            whose territory included the southern portion of the Plateaus and
            Canyonlands. They are one of the many, lesser-known native peoples
            who were a casualty of the calamitous changes during the Historic
            period. In that sense, their story represents the fate of many native
            groups who once roamed Texas: extinction and near oblivion.</p>
          <p>Although the Gueiquesale actually may have occupied or ranged over
            a much larger region, they are not discussed in Spanish documents
            with any depth until the 1670s, when they began to solicit the help
            and protection of the Spanish. By that time, the Apache were pushing
            south off the Southern Plains due to Comanche intrusion into their
            former homeland. In their wake, many native groups were also pushed
            southward. Gueiquesale territory at that time was centered on the
            general vicinity of modern Del Rio and north into the Canyonlands
            as well as south into Coahuila.</p>
          <p>Although much of the Plateaus and Canyonlands had not been explored
            by the Spanish prior to the 1670s, word of unrest of various native
            peoples in the general region had reached northern Mexican towns 
            in the 1660s. Some reports indicated that as early as 1658 native
            peoples from north of the Rio Grande were asking the Spanish for
            missions and presidios and actually petitioned the government to
            settle close to Saltillo. The petition was denied, but it and other
            requests prompted Father Juan Larios, a Franciscan friar, to travel
            north toward the Rio Grande where he stayed for three years.</p>
          <p>Upon his return, natives were again petitioning for settlement.
            This time the petition included a number of groups (Babane, Jumano,
            Bobole, Baia, Contotore, Tetecore, and Momone). The petition also
            asserted that these groups would be joined by two other very large
            groups: the <strong>Gueiquesale</strong> and the Tiltic y Maigunm.
            One Gueiquesale was brought before the court. He testified that his
            people wished to settle in <em>pueblos</em> (towns).</p>
          <p>The motives of the petitioners are important in understanding subsequent
            events. The smaller of these native groups said they needed to band
            together with larger groups. Another factor was that several years
            past some native peoples had aided the Spanish in battles against
            the Cacaxtles and others. Likely, they were concerned about reprisals
            from the Cacaxtles or allies of the groups that had been attacked.
            They were equally concerned about the continuing Spanish raiding
            of their rancher&iacute;as for slaves. Although Spain&rsquo;s official
            policy outlawed slave raids, unofficially they continued. The native
            people in the Plateaus and Canyonlands practiced a hunting and gathering
            lifestyle, requiring them to move frequently from place to place.
            Their small, temporary encampments (rancher&iacute;as) left them
            vulnerable to the raids. Living among larger groups would make them
            less vulnerable, particularly if the settlements contained missions
            and presidios.</p>
          <p>Permission was given in early 1674 for the larger settlements to
            be established in northern Coahuila. Priests, including Fray Larios
            and Dionysio de Penasco along with Fray Manuel de la Cruz, and soldiers
            under the command of Captain Elisondo, traveled north to northern
            Coahuila where they founded two settlements. Santa Rosa de Santa
            Maria was located on the Sabinas River. San Ildefonso de la Paz was
            14 leagues (36 miles) north of the Sabinas and about 50 miles south
            of Del Rio. Gueiquesale were the largest group at San Ildefonso,
            numbering over 500, but other Gueiquesale were also among the natives
            at Santa Rosa. These settlements were the first of several in this
            general area, all aimed at bringing natives of northern Coahuila
            and the Plateaus and Canyonlands south to live in settlements, learn
            to farm, and become peaceful communities. Their successes and failures
            over the next several years illustrate the reality was less than
            desired.</p>
          <p>Traveling north of the Rio Grande, the friars persuaded many groups
            to go south and settle with them in the two settlements. As many
            as 3,200 natives were reported living in clusters near Santa Rosa
            in June of 1674. However, their presence had as much to do with the
            large prickly pear fields that were also near Santa Rosa. Reports
            from the friars state that the natives were eating the ripe prickly
            pear tunas, but they also reported concern that the natives would
            leave when the harvest was over. Their fears were well grounded.
            Having no stores of food in the settlement, the natives and priests
            left Santa Rosa to find other food. In their absence, natives destroyed
            the settlement that same summer.</p>
          <p>Other settlements and missions were established over the next century,
            some ending like Santa Rosa, others having limited success. As late
            as 1762, 26 Coetzales (Gueiquesale) were living at San Miguel de
            Aguayo of Monclova. While the efforts of priests and soldiers to
            establish settlements for the Gueiquesale and other groups did not
            meet with the successes they hoped, they left behind a number of
            Spanish documents with details about the Gueiquesale and their allies,
            the foods they sought, as well as some details about their family
            and spiritual lives. Those details are summarized below.</p>
          <h3>Alliances with other Native Peoples</h3>
          <p>Like other native peoples, the Gueiquesale had alliances with other
            groups. Spanish documents are far from perfect in telling us about
            those alliances, but the repeated presence of the Gueiquesale with
            certain other groups (and not with certain other native peoples)
            strongly suggest their friendship with them. Hence, we suspect that
            they were close to the Manos Prietas, Babane, Jumano, Bobole, Baia,
            Contotore, Tetecore, and Momone because these groups included the
            Gueiquesale as among the peoples who wanted to establish settlements
            in northern Coahuila.</p>
          <p> In several documents from the 1670s, Don Esteban, a Gueiquesale
            leader, appears to have been the leader of a coalition of people
            who included the Gueiquesale, Manos Prietas, and no less than 22
            other native groups. Leaders like Don Esteban were charismatic individuals
            who tended to make decisions that enhanced the well being of the
            larger group. When such a leader emerged, other, often smaller groups,
            sought friendship with the leader&rsquo;s group. During stressful
            times, such allies could be called upon to come to their aid. Certainly,
            the large numbers of groups under Don Esteban&rsquo;s leadership
            together with the Gueiquesale population estimates of more than 700
            must have made his a fairly powerful and well-respected coalition.</p>
          <p>Alliances among groups were not static. Like similar arrangements
            among countries today, they shifted as situations changed. Reports
            about Spanish efforts to settle the Gueiquesale document that another
            group&mdash;the Yorica&mdash;sought an alliance with the Gueiquesale.
            The manner in which this alliance was sought&mdash;cautiously through
            an intermediary and with gifts&mdash;may represent the way alliances
            were formed among different people in the Plateaus and Canyonlands.
            In 1674, one of the priests pressed north of the Rio Grande to encourage
            the Manos Prietas to move south. The Manos Prietas were already likely
            allies of the Gueiquesale.</p>
          <p>Earlier that year, Captain Elisando met with leaders of groups who
            wanted to settle, and the Gueiquesale and Manos Prietas were among
            those leaders. When Fray Penasco found the Manos Prietas in the Plateaus
            and Canyonlands, they told him of another group, the Giorica or Yorica,
            who lived just to the north. Here, the Manos Prietas acted as intermediary.
            It is interesting that the Yorica first approached the priest rather
            than the numerous Gueiquesale who, at that time, were enjoying the
            prickly pear tuna fields near the Sabinas River. Perhaps this was
            simply because the priest was there and interested in meeting new
            peoples he could encourage to move into the settlements. On the other
            hand, it may reflect the caution of the Yorica, a way to illicit
            information about other groups yet still be able to retreat if necessary.</p>
          <p>Regardless, Fray Penasco sent ambassadors to the Yorica. During
            the ensuing diplomatic exchanges, they released to the Manos Prietas
            a captive Gueiquesale boy. This was the gift. The
            Yorica likely knew of the alliance between the Manos Prietas and
            the Gueiquesale, and were told during the diplomatic exchanges the
            Manos Prietas were going to travel south with the priest. Giving
            up the captive boy was an offering of good will. The offering was
            accepted and sealed by a ceremony to celebrate the boy&rsquo;s return.
            In the end, 300 Yorica traveled with the Manos Prietas to Santa Rosa
            where they were peacefully settled among the other residents, including
            the populous Gueiquesale.</p>
          <h3>Gueiquesale Life and Families </h3>
          <p>According to records written by the priests, the Gueiquesale subsisted on mescal,
            tunas of prickly pears, acorns and other nuts, fish, deer and buffalo.
            At one point the friars were out of food and ate the same sotol,
            lechuguilla, and tule reeds as the natives. </p>
          <p> When the Gueiquesale and their allies lived in the settlements,
            they did learn to farm, successfully raising a few crops. However,
            the settlements did not have the resources to sustain large numbers
            of people indefinitely nor year round. Because of this, the people
            would return to the settlements when crops were ready for harvesting,
            then travel north to the Plateaus and Canyonlands to hunt deer and
            buffalo or other resources during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p> Spanish documents inconsistently report on the family lives of
            native peoples. Each author reported on things that seemed important
            to him. Thus, we glean information from small bits and pieces. For
            peoples like the Apache, seen over a broad territory and a long time,
            the small bits and pieces eventually add up to a bigger picture.
            Not the whole picture, but certainly a better one. For the Gueiquesale,
            the picture remains small, but it is tantalizing.</p>
          <p> We know that the Gueiquesale were relatively numerous. Persons
            pleading for native missions near the Rio Grande specifically say
            that the Gueiquesale are one of two much larger groups. We learn
            from another document that the settlements near the Rio Grande had
            512 Gueiquesale there. Another document states that over 700 Gueiquesale
            were in a camp north of the Rio Grande. Given their hunting and gathering
            lifestyle, it is doubtful that all Gueiquesale families would move
            en mass. The Chihuahuan desert in which they resided was limited
            in resources and would have made such large camps difficult to feed.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, when the priests traveled with them in 1674,
            their reports suggest that smaller groups traveled parallel to one
            another, separated by several leagues. Such a pattern would have
            allowed them to keep in touch while finding sufficient food to feed
            the people who traveled in the individual group. Each group moved
            when local food resources were depleted. Seasons of plenty would
            likely have encouraged many of these smaller groups to come together.
            Such seasons would have been when prickly pear tunas ripened in some
            of the areas where it grew in abundance and when the Gueiquesale
            cooperated to hunt bison. In addition to providing sustenance, these
            large group gatherings would have renewed friendships and other ties
            that bound the Gueiquesale together as a unified whole.</p>
          <p>We know that they cared for one another. When the Spanish tried
            to settle the Gueiquesale into one of the Coahuila settlements in
            1674, they declined because their people were ill and they wanted
            to take them away to care for them. They promised to return when
            the sick ones were better. The men showed great valor in battle.
            When one of the priests, Fray Manuel, was concerned for his life
            while he was north of the Rio Grande, Gueiquesale warriors came to
            his aid, embracing him. Their scouts found the enemy group nearby,
            and the Gueiquesale warriors declared to the priest they would die
            before they would abandon him. Together, these actions suggest a
            loyal, close-knit people.</p>
          <h3>Changing Worlds</h3>
          <p>The world of the Gueiquesale and other native groups in the Plateaus
            and Canyonlands underwent drastic changes beginning in the 1600s.
            We know that the Gueiquesale and their allies wanted the protection
            and aid of priests and soldiers. While they clearly did not understand
            the Catholic or other European religions, they did witness firsthand
            native groups in Saltillo and other Spanish communities, finding some
            measure of protection after ascribing to a belief in the European
            religion. We also know that these groups were under increasing pressure
            from the Apache advance south into their territories. Strange new
            diseases, such as smallpox and measles, entered their territory at
            the same time as these Europeans and those diseases killed their
            friends and families.</p>
          <p>We cannot fully understand how the Gueiquesale interpreted these
            changes. But, we do know that several rock art panels in Val Verde
            County show mission-like architecture. One has a stick-like European
            figure in front of such a structure with his hands raised. Given
            that it is generally believed that rock art represents expressions
            of a group&rsquo;s spiritual life, could these represent an effort
            to reach out to this new religion of a people unaffected by the Apache
            intrusion or the diseases? We may never know for certain, but these
            rock art panels are few and unique.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of spiritual life and tradition is provided in the
            description of their battle with other groups. As described above,
            when Fray Manual feared for his life, 98 Gueiquesale warriors led
            by Don Esteban went to his rescue. Apart from their bows and arrows,
            hide-covered shields, and a small loincloth of deerskin, they also
            wore body decoration&mdash;streaks of red, yellow, and white across
            their chests and arms. In addition, they wore headdresses made of
            vines, mesquite leaves, and feathers.</p>
          <p>Since we know that none of these body adornments would be used as
            weapons, we must assume that either they were ways to ensure that
            in a battle one could easily tell who was an ally and who was an
            enemy, or they were ways to ward off death. Before the battle, the
            priest showed the warriors a cross, or image of Christ, and told
            them that God would help them overcome the superior numbers of enemies
            they faced. When this same priest was taken to their rancher&iacute;a,
            a village of some 700 people, the Gueiquesale women danced to express
            their pleasure at his visit. Apparently, this was their custom when
            visitors they wanted to see came to their villages. </p>
