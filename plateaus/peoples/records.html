            lines of evidence to paint the faint pictures we have of Texas&rsquo; native
            peoples during historic times. Written documents, such as diaries
            of missionaries or explorers; expeditionary maps, with their depictions
            of native encampments; paintings and drawings, both by observers
            as well as the native peoples themselves; and archeological evidence,
            the physical traces left by native groups, all offer glimpses into
            the past.</p>
          <p>None considered alone provide a satisfactory rendering of any
            one group. Taken together, however, the various pieces of information
            help us understand what life was like for native peoples during a
            critical juncture in their history. The Native Peoples exhibits 
            rely on a combination of <strong>ethnohistory</strong>&mdash;the
            study of documents to describe and study groups that may or may not
            have a written history&mdash;and <strong>archeology,</strong> the
            study of past cultures based on the material evidence they left behind.
            In this section, we look at examples of the different types of information
            and the larger picture that is cumulatively revealed.</p>
          <h3><a name="rec"></a>The Archeological Record</h3> 
          <p>Archeological excavations 
             indicate that people have lived in the Plateaus and Canyonlands region for the last
            13,500 years. Their material culture 
            shows that they were clever, industrious individuals, living in groups
            and ably sustaining their families and group members by fishing in
            the rivers and streams, hunting deer and other mammals for meat and
            hides, and roasting large bulbs of sotol and lechuguilla. The beautiful
            rock art they painted tells us that they had a rich spiritual tradition
            as well.</p>
          <p>Yet, oddly<strong>, </strong>it is the most recent of these native
            peoples&mdash;the people who occupied the region when Europeans came to northern Mexico and Texas&mdash;that we probably
            understand the least, based on archeological remains. Only a handful
            of sites have been identified that can be related
            to recent native occupation of the region. Remarkably, some of these sites, such as 41CX131 excavated in Crockett County in west Texas, 
            indicate the continuation of a similar lifeway and subsistence over
            thousands of years.   There,  an earth oven was  used by native peoples  
            perhaps as recently as 300 years years ago to roast the hearts (stem bases) of desert plants, a practice employed by native peoples in Texas for more than 8,000 years. </p>
          <p>A quite different lifestyle is suggested in the findings from Infierno Camp in Val Verde County. Archeologists have identified the remains of a large encampment with what appear to be more than120 wickiup rings (small rings of stone of less than 3 meters in diameter) and 7 large tipi rings (circles of stone measuring from 3 to 10 meters in diameter.)   The stones were apparently placed to hold wood supports for the shelters; in the case of the large rings, they may have supported large wooden poles for tall, hide-covered tipis. A remarkably low frequency of burned rock at this and other &quot;Infierno phase&quot; sites stands in sharp contrast to the older, more prevalent burned rock midden sites with their large heaps of spent cooking stones. There are few artifacts, other than sherds of pottery and occasional chipped stone arrowpoints, such as Perdiz and and no acceptable radiocarbon assays to date these sites. The large tipi rings, however, point to a time when native peoples were moving their camps with the aid of horses. Other sites are rock art sites of the historic period, with 
              vivid depictions of figures in European garb, horses, and mission-like structures. </p>
          <p>Investigations of contact sites&mdash;places where native peoples
            encountered or lived with Europeans, such as Spanish priests or settlers&mdash;show
            that native customs were practiced even in mission contexts. At the
            site of Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz (see Historic Encounter exhibit) in  Uvalde
            County, archeologists found chipped stone tools and late-period triangular
            arrow points inside the structure. They also found gunflints, likely
            made by the Lipan Apache who were living there. </p>
          <h3><a name="evi"></a>Documentary Evidence</h3>
          <p>Most of our knowledge of native peoples in the region comes from the records kept by Spanish priests and government officials.  In comparison to other parts of the state, however, expeditions
              into the Plateaus and Canyonlands were few and records scant. The
              dry, desert conditions of the region generally were viewed as undesirable by both the Spaniards when they claimed these lands in the sixteenth century
              and by the Americans who came overland or by sea to settle in Texas
              during the nineteenth century.</p>
          <p>Economics and the need for cheap labor drew some of the first expeditions. During their first 100 years of colonization, the Spanish discovered
            rich silver deposits in Mexico about 300 miles south of modern Texas.
            Miners flocked to those mines to find work and, hopefully, wealth.
            But, silver mining required large labor forces and Spanish labor
            was inadequate to fill the need. As a result, many Indians were pressed
            into labor, and many of the earliest encounters of the native peoples
            with Europeans were during hostile Spanish raids to capture and enslave
            Indian workers. </p>
          <p>The first Spanish expedition into the Plateaus and Canyonlands that
            was not for the purpose of capturing slaves was that of Gaspar Castano
            de Sosa in 1590. Departing from Mexico, he took men, women, and children via wagon train
            to settle in New Mexico. His route was from Almaden (today Monclova,
            Mexico) north-northwest to the region of Santa Fe in New Mexico.
            Had he known the difficulty this route would cause the expedition,
            he might have had second thoughts. Researchers believe
            that his route took him across the Rio Grande at Del Rio. Up to this
            point, the expedition had encountered<strong></strong> little trouble.
            Water was sufficient and the topography mild. However, once they
            left the Rio Grande, their travel was plagued by the ravines and
            canyons that dominate the region. They could see water in the ravines,
            but could not reach it. De Sosa' s experience exemplifies the challenges of the canyonlands terrain.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>We continued in search of the Rio Salado [ Pecos River], the
              object of our journey; and Captain Cristobal de Heredia sent out
              [several men] for this purpose. They succeeded in finding the river,
              which pleased them very much. Domingo de Santiesteban came back
              to convey the good news that he and his companions had at last
              discovered the Salado [Pecos River], although it was impossible to reach it because
              of the many high rocks and gullies. We spent the night in a ravine
              where there was a pool that supplied water for our people&hellip;.
              We tried every means of reaching the stream, but to no avail. </em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>While the expedition eventually reached New Mexico, the journey
            was grueling. Accounts of the route, describing the hardships, were
            circulated shortly after the trip and no Spaniard ever repeated
            this route to New Mexico.</p>
          <p>Castano de Sosa reported seeing only a few native peoples during his journey. They found <strong>&ldquo;rancherias&rdquo;</strong> (a
            small camp or hamlet) and huts, but rarely found them occupied. It
            was only when they finally were able to descend to the Pecos River,
            likely in the vicinity of Sheffield, Texas, that they came upon a
            group of people who called themselves &ldquo;Depesguan,&rdquo; a
            name that apparently was not used again. These people gave the Spanish buffalo
            meat<strong></strong> and chamois skins and used dogs to carry their camp supplies.
            Beyond this, we know little of the people encountered by de Sosa.</p>
          <p>Later expeditions record more contact with native peoples. Juan
            Dominguez de Mendoza&rsquo;s expedition from 1683-1684 was made in
            response to requests by the Jumanos and their allies for protection
            from the Apaches and for increased Spanish settlements and friars. Mendoza's journey from El Paso del Norte to southwest Texas and on to the
              eastern Edwards Plateau provides vivid descriptions of encounters
              with aboriginal peoples, particularly with lesser known native groups
              such as the Gediondo (or Jediondo).</p>
          <p> When the expedition neared the
                rancher&iacute;a on the east side of the Pecos River (in present-day
                Crockett County), they were met with a joyful ceremony. The captains
                of the Gediondo, mounted on horses, came out to welcome them; other
                natives on foot carried a heavy wooden cross painted in red and yellow
                and a flag of white taffeta decorated with two blue crosses. They
                kissed the frocks of the friars, and both groups proceeded toward
                the rancheria where they were welcomed by the majority of the women
                and children with shouts and expressions of happiness. Several huts
                made of tule reeds were offered to the visitors, although Mendoza
                declined to use them.</p>
          <p>The writer found the Indians to be &ldquo;docile and affectionate,&rdquo; although
            greatly fearful of the Apache. The party was given food and deer
            skins, and during the week-long stay, they killed 24 buffalo. An
            assembly was held with other Indian groups who pleaded with Mendoza
            to make war on the Apaches.</p>
          <p>Many accounts reported threats of hostilities with groups such as
            the Comanche, including raids on the expedition camps. Marques de
            Rubi, while conducting an inspection tour of the presidios from 1776
            to 1768, traveled over the Edwards Plateau to visit Presidio San Sab&aacute;.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>July 25. &hellip; To conduct the inspection of the presidio,
              we were in constant danger and constantly had to guard the horse
              herd. Several times some horses were lost to the enemy Comanches
              and their allies of the north. We stayed here until August 3 without
              other events, except for seeing the tracks of spies and some smoke
              signals, by which they communicated their arrival to one another.
              Marques de Rubi, July 25, 1767.</em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>During their journeys, many Spanish travelers made notes on the
            natural world&mdash;the region&rsquo;s varied terrain, plants, and
            animals. </p>
          <p>Rub&iacute; writes:</p>
         <blockquote> <p><em>August 4, 1767. We went constantly downward until
               reaching the Rio de Janes ( Llano River). This day we found enormous
               numbers of small bison herds, to which we gave chase and killed
               four. Also, a bear was roped and caught alive, and three wild
               turkeys&hellip;, all of
            which was a great bounty for the convoy.</em></p>
         </blockquote>
          <p>Swiss botanist Jean Louis Berlandier, traveling with the Mexican
            Boundary Commission in the early 1800s, accompanied a party of Comanches
            on a bear hunt near the headwaters of the Medina River. He noted
            two varieties on bear in Texas at the time,</p>
         <p>These documents contain wonderful information but they are also
            flawed in some respects. They present the native peoples from the
            writer&rsquo;s unique perspective. Few of the early travelers could
            speak native languages, and the native people who spoke Spanish,
            at least in the earliest encounters, understood those languages imperfectly.
            Thus, when we use these documents to make better sense of the past,
            we must accept their inherent flaws. </p></td>

        <p>Other sources of information are historic
            maps. Again, the maps reflect an imperfect knowledge of the geography
            of the region. For instance, as late as 1836, the Pecos River is
            depicted flowing into the Gulf of Mexico. Yet,
            many maps rendered by members of Spanish expeditions denote, on a
            broad scale, locations of different native groups, even depicting
            encampments and people, such as the Apache figures shown in the map
            drawn by the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers in 1803.</p>
          <h3><a name="trac"></a>Tracking Names through Time </h3>
          <p>For researchers, tracking individual historic native groups through
            time to try to get a sense of their culture is a labor-intensive
            process with rare successes. Historical researchers, combing archives
            and journals, have identified the names of <strong>more than 600
            native groups </strong><strong>in Texas</strong> during Historic
            times. Native peoples changed locations frequently and&mdash;with
            pressures from invading tribes such as the Apache and Comanche &mdash;often merged
            with others, losing their original group identities and, eventually,
            their group names. Although many native peoples could speak several
            native languages&mdash;including
            those of their allies&mdash;the names by which they referred to other
            groups were usually in their own tongue.</p>
          <p>Spaniards added their own twists in recording the multi-syllabic
            Indian names, and it is likely that they gave different names to the
            same peoples, depending on their location. The people seen in the
            El Paso area in the 1580s were called <em>Gorreta </em>(meaning small
            cap) because  their haircut  resembled a cap. In other
            cases, the first name given a native people was based on a place<strong>.
            </strong> As will be apparent in the subsequent sections
            on the Apache, Kiowa, and Gueisquale, there were many variants for
            names of native groups. </p>
          <h3><a name="ins"></a>Intriguing Insights </h3>
          <p>In spite of the scarcity of accounts and some of the possible flaws
            in the evidence, we nonetheless can draw several interesting conclusions
            about the historic native peoples of the Plateaus and Canyonlands.
            First, the documents and the archeology demonstrate that the region
            was chiefly occupied by hunters and gatherers who moved frequently
            from place to place as resources were depleted. The archeological
            evidence points to small encampments as the rule. Clearly, there
            is no evidence of large villages like those of the Caddo of East
            Texas or the pueblos of the El Paso region which stretched for as much as a mile along stream courses.</p>
          <p>Spanish observers generally wrote of native peoples who had a mobile
            lifestyle, moving several times during any given year, a necessary
            adaptation to their desert homelands. That is, food resources such
            as tuna (the fruit of the prickly pear) only ripen once a year. When
            the food within easy access of their camps was nearly used up, they
            would move to a new location. Such moves were not haphazard. The native peoples          knew the land and its resources, and when they moved, they moved
            to an area that they knew would provide another food source, such as agave, sotol,  pecans, blackberries, and  a host of animals&mdash;from bison and deer to
            rabbits, rats, birds, and snakes.</p>
          <p>Other information we have pertains to the camps of native peoples.
            The physical size of most camps that have been identified archeologically
            is small and circumscribed, suggesting the camps were occupied by
            a family (man, wife, and children) or an extended family (man, wife,
            children, grandparents, and/or close relatives). We also may be able
            to identify features such as campfires (hearths) and several special
            activity areas where stone tools were made or sharpened or food was
            prepared. Special food preparation features include burned rock middens&mdash;the
            remains of earth ovens in which hot rocks were used to bake bulbs
            of lechuguilla or other desert succulent plants. Correlating relatively
            recent archeological sites to specific historic events, however,
            is challenging. Ethnohistorian Mariah Wade has suggested
            that some archeological sites along the Pecos River may be the site of Jumano
            or Gediondo rancherias visited by Mendoza; however, there is no &ldquo;smoking
            gun&rdquo; or substantive evidence to support this.</p>
          <p>In a few cases, native peoples of the Historic Period left ephemeral
            traces of their world views in paintings on canyon walls or in rock
            shelters. Some rock art panels, such as those at Vaquero Shelter
            in Val Verde County and Paint Rock in Concho County, record
            significant and often seminal events, such as the coming of Anglo
            priests and soldiers, the establishment of missions, or warfare with
            invading native peoples. Horses, crosses, European costume and hats,
            bows and arrows, guns, and other symbols distinguish these late rock
            art displays from the many earlier artistic expressions of prehistoric
            peoples in the region.</p>
          <p>Indian artists also left behind painted hides&mdash;calendar books
            and tipis&mdash;that record events that were significant to their
            people. During the late nineteenth-century Indian Wars and reservation period, artists from
            the Kiowa and other tribes painted people and events that were significant
            to their people.</p>
          <p>Finally, we know, based on historic documents, that the native peoples
            were not isolated small families wandering across the Plateaus and
            Canyonlands. Rather, they had ties, connections, and alliances with
            many other groups. No doubt, some of those connections were with
            people whom they considered to be of the same group, much as we today
            say we are &ldquo;central Texans&rdquo; or &ldquo;east Texans&rdquo;.
            Some bonds between these people were based on periodic events, but
            this intermittent contact would result in deeper alliances. For example,
            when the fruits of the prickly pear ripened, family bands came together
            to harvest and celebrate the bounty. Such closely shared endeavors
            would have enhanced and cement ties of the various families.</p>
          <p> As they moved to other resources, other groups would be present
            and the family band would cement/renew an alliance with those groups.
            Hence, each family and group operated within an area where they not
            only knew and appreciated the food resources, but also knew and had
            alliances with other native peoples. These strengths enabled native
            peoples of the region to withstand many times of hardship. Ultimately
            they were not sufficient to withstand the rapid and devastating changes
            of the Historic Period.</p>
