        <p><strong><em>Apache</em></strong>&mdash;without a doubt, the name
            is one of the most  evocative of all Indian groups, charged
            with history and popularized in books and movies. However, the name
            Apache is a generic one, applying to several tribes that have shared&mdash;but
            unique&mdash;histories. The Apache include groups that have been
            known at various times as Apachu, Lipan, Mescalero, Faraones, Gilenos,
            Natagee, Querechos, Tontos, Ypandi, and Yutaglen-ne, to name but
            a few.</p>
          <p>Many federally recognized tribes in the United States today have
            names that were given to them by Europeans or by other Indian groups
            in early historic times. In some cases, Spaniards or other Europeans
            assigned a name based on physical appearances, such as hairstyle,
            or a cultural aspect of the group. In other cases, the first name
            given a native people was based on a place. For example, <em>Querecho</em> was
            the name given to the native people on the Southern Plains by the
            people who lived in Pecos Pueblo who had close trade relations with
            that group of Apache.</p>
          <p>The term Apache dates from the year 1601 when Onate used the term <em>Apachu</em> to
            refer to the people occupying the Southern Plains. The name was later
            changed by the Spanish to &ldquo;Apache,&rdquo; but the name was
            not universally used until the nineteenth century. Prior to that time,
            both they and others used distinct names for their various groups.
            Manuel Merino in 1804 wrote: </p>
          <blockquote> <p><em>They can be divided into nine principal groups&hellip;. The
              names&hellip;in their language [are]&hellip;.: Vinienctinen-ne,
              Sagatajen-ne, Tjusccujen-ne, Yecujen-ne, Yntugen-ne, Sejen-ne,
              Cuelcajen-ne, Lipanjen-ne, and Yutaglen-ne. We have replaced these
              naming them in the same order: Tontos, Chircagues [Chiricahuas],
              Gilenos, Mimbrenos, Faraones, Mescaleros, Llaneros, Lipanes, and
              Nabajoes [Navajos], all of them under the general name of Apaches. </em></p></blockquote>
          <p>A number of Apache peoples have roots in Texas, but during the prehistoric period they lived in the northern Plains and Canada.
            As they moved south, they did not settle in the Plateaus and Canyonlands
            but, rather, in and around the Southern Plains of Texas, Oklahoma,
            and New Mexico. While scholars dispute the route and timing of their
            migration south there seems to be fairly clear evidence that the
            Querechos and possibly the Teyas whom Coronado met on his march across
            the Southern Plains in 1541 were Apaches.</p>
          <p> As we can tell from their names, the Apache are not just one group
            of people. Either prior to or shortly after their migration south,
            they divided into eastern and western groups and both of these geographic
            divisions subdivided further. Today they retain those same subdivisions.
            The eastern Apache generally occupied the lands and areas of the
            Southern Plains. Spanish documents make clear that subdivisions of
            the eastern Apache existed from their earliest encounter with those
            native peoples. We do not know, however, if these subdivisions were
            an artifact of their movement to the south, where separate bands occupied
            different regions, or if the subdivisions were a long-standing tradition. <strong></strong>Eventually
            some Apache names began to take precedence over the variety of earliest
            appellations. Mescalero Apache, mentioned as early as 1725, and Lipan
            were maintained, while Pelones, Natagees, and Fararones were less
            frequently used and eventually disappeared from the documentary record.</p>
          <p>The Apache in Texas began a gradual move  toward the Plateaus
            and Canyonlands during the late seventeenth century and were gradually displaced
            by the Comanche as that group pushed them southward. Documents written
            by Spanish military officers with many years of experience on the
            northern frontiers and familiar with both the geography and the native
            peoples in the region place the Apache in the area of the Plateaus
            and Canyonlands by the eighteenth century. One of these military
            men, Joseph de Berroteran, wrote that the Apache &ldquo;came from
            the Rio Puerco [Pecos] where it joins with the Rio del Norte [ Rio
            Grande].&rdquo; He warned government officials that, if the presidios
            that had been established on the Rio Grande were not maintained,
            the Apache would control the Rio Grande from El Paso to San Juan
            Bautista (located between modern Eagle Pass and Laredo). Joseph de
            Urrutia, another military officer, wrote in 1733 that the Apache
            resided along the Pecos, frequently traveling east and west along
            the Rio Grande.</p>
          <p> The Apache, particularly the Lipan and Mescalero, had a major presence
            in the Plateaus and Canyonlands in the early eighteenth-century period.
            The westward movement of English-speaking settlers across North America
            and the Spanish colonization of the Southwest combined to create great
            unrest and turmoil among native peoples. As the Apache were forced
            from the Southern Plains by the quickly-moving Comanche, they began
            to align themselves with other native peoples, including the Jumano
            and Tonkawa, groups with whom they previously had hostile relations
            They also sought peace with the Spanish. Those peace efforts resulted
            in the establishment of a Spanish mission, <a href="../../sansaba/index.html">Santa
            Cruz de San Sab&aacute;</a> and
            <a href="../../presidio/index.html">presidio at San Sab&aacute;</a> and,
            later, the two missions, <strong>San Lorenzo de la Santa
            Cruz</strong>  and <strong>Nuestra
            Senora de Candelaria</strong> on the Nueces River, all during the mid-eighteenth
            century. </p>
          <p> Ultimately, the San Sab&aacute; mission was destined to fail because the
            Spanish ignored&mdash;or were unaware of&mdash;the volatile relationships
            among native groups. As Maria Wade notes in her 2002 volume on the Native Americans of the Edward Plateau, the Spaniards
            made a significant error in establishing the mission : </p>
          <blockquote>  <p><em> At issue is the assumption of the Spaniards that they could
              be friends with everyone regardless of Native internal enmities,
              as well as the political arrogance of making new alliances without
              informing former allies, especially when the new alliances were
              made with their bitter enemies. </em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> The mis-step by the Spanish led to an assault on the mission, orchestrated by Tonkawa, Comanche, Bidais, Wichita, and
            Caddo Indians, all enemies of the Lipan and other Apache. </p>
          <p>Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz, established in 1762, postdates
            the disaster at San Sab&aacute;. Although it lasted longer, San Lorenzo
            was never officially approved and was burned and then abandoned in
            1771. Situated on the upper Nueces River at present-day Camp Wood, Texas, the
            mission was founded to serve the Lipan Apache. Missionaries reported
            that some 3,000 Lipan were at the mission; Spanish reports, however,
            indicate that there was a regular coming and going of individual
            bands  of groups of Lipan. The priests sought to teach
            the Lipan to grow corn and other crops. However, raids by hostile native groups plagued the mission and in 1771 it was
            abandoned. Curiously, however, the Lipan and Mescalero continued
            to frequent the area of this mission and Mission Candelaria in the century
            to come, often to grow crops when they could not access other food </p>
          <p> In the second half of the eighteenth century and after their mission
            on the San Sab&aacute; was destroyed, the Apache ranged from the Bolson
            de Mapimi to the Rio Grande to the Nueces. In 1772, 300 Lipan Apache
            attacked haciendas and pueblos in Coahuila. A Spanish military map
            dated 1773 continued to call the Pecos River the &ldquo;Salado o
            rio del Apache del Nataje que la Fora lo llama del Pecho y Danville
            de los 7 Rios,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;the Salty River or river of
            the Nataje Apache whom Spanish engineer and cartographer Nicolas
            la Fora calls the Apache of the Pecos and whom Danville calls the
            Apache of the Seven Rivers.&rdquo; On that same map, several other
            Apache groups are shown in or close to the Plateaus and Canyonlands&mdash;the
            Apaches Jumanes just north of the Lipanes and on the east side of
            the Pecos, with the Natajes and Mescaleros depicted on the west side
            of the Pecos. Two years later, Juan del Ugarte also noted their presence
            in the region. Traveling north of Monclova some 740 miles in an effort
            to force the Apache away from Coahuila, he found them on the Rio
            San Pedro or Devils River. The Mescalero were, by the late eighteenth century,
            roaming the Plateaus and Canyonlands, and Spanish armies repeatedly
            found them between the Rio Sabinas, Piedras Negras, and the mouth
            of the Pecos, either alone or in the company of Lipan, or other Apache
            bands.</p>
          <p> The Apache maintained a presence in northern Mexico in subsequent
            decades, but the Lipan and Mescalero were often found in the region
            of south and Central Texas, particularly on the Nueces, the
            San Antonio, and Guadalupe river areas as well as the Colorado. Their presence
            on the Pecos River can be well documented in the nineteenth century including
            the area of Toyah Creek&rsquo;s confluence with the Pecos. </p>
          <p> The Apache presence in the Plateaus and Canyonlands was quite broad
            during the nineteenth century. Manuel Merino, a prominent government
            official in Chihuahua, issued a report on the Apache in 1804 that
            describes their territory. He wrote that the Apache nation &ldquo;inhabits
            the vast empty expanse living between 20 and 38 degrees of latitude
            and 264 and 277 degrees of longitude&hellip;to that of La Bah&iacute;a del
            Espiritu Santo.&rdquo; Elsewhere, Merino described the territories
            of the various Apache subdivisions:</p>
         <blockquote> <p><em> [The Faraones] are still quite numerous. They inhabit the mountains
              lying between the Rio Grande del Norte and the Pecos, maintain
              a close union with the Mezcaleros, and make war on us. The two
              provinces of New Mexico and Nueva Vizcaya have been and still are
              the scene of their incursions. In both provinces they have made
              peace treaties various times, but have broken them every time,
              with the exception of a rancheria here or there whose faithful
              conduct has obliged us to let them settle at the presidio of San
              Elcerio [San Elizario]. They
              border on the north with the province of New Mexico, on the west
              with the Mimbreno Apaches, with the Mezcaleros on the east, and
              on the south with the province of Nueva Vizcaya&hellip;.[The Mezcaleros]
              generally inhabit the mountains near the Pecos River, extending
              northward to the edge of the Cumancheria. They approach that territory
              in the seasons propitious to the slaughter of bison, and when they
              do this, they join with the Llanero tribe, their neighbors&hellip;.These
              Indians usually made their entry through the Bolson de Mapimi whether
              they are going to maraud in the province of Coaguila or in that
              of Nueva Vizcaya&hellip;.They border on the west with the Faraon
              tribe, on the east with the Llaneros, and on the south with our
              frontier of Nueva Vizcaya and Coahuila. Llaneros occupy the plains
              and deserts lying between the Pecos and the Colorado&hellip;. It
              is a very populous tribe, which is divided into three categories:
              Natages, Lipiyanes, and Llaneros&hellip;.[The Lipan] is probably
              the most populous of all Apache tribes, and for many years it has
              lived in peace on the frontiers of Coahuila and Texas. </em></p>

          <p> When the Apache were first encountered by the Spanish, they were
            described as hunters and gatherers with a focus on bison hunting<em>. </em>In
            1686, the Apache were termed &quot;the owners of all the buffalo
            plains.&quot; People do not live by meat alone, however. Some researchers
            believe that the Apache practiced agriculture by the time they arrived
            in the Southern Plains. Early Spanish accounts do not confirm that
            practice, and others believe that any extensive agricultural efforts
            began in the late nineteenth century</p>
          <p>The Apache were not ignorant of agricultural practices, however,
            and we do know that some crops were grown by the eighteenth century: &quot;They
            each sow corn and beans near where the Spaniards live.&quot; While
            sporadic, these efforts to grow corn continued, often focused on
            the area of the Toyah Creek confluence with the Pecos River in the
            Trans-Pecos region. When the Texas legislature briefly flirted with
            the idea of establishing an Apache reservation in 1853, the area
            they considered for the reservation was along this creek
            because the Apache had such a long association with that area. In Texas, the Lipan and Mescalero were also known to consume pecans,
            prickly pear tuna, and agave when they were in season.</p>

    Agave is also called mescal, and it is the use of agave that gave the Mescalero their name. Early twentieth-century ethnohistorians Edward Castetter and Morris Opler observed the Mescalero Apache during a season of agave harvesting and processing. They noted that when the agave ripens, women would make expeditions to regions where it grew in abundance. They would dig out the bulbs of the plants, chopping off the surface leaves,  stalk,and roots. Pits 10-to-12 feet in diameter were dug, then lined with flat rocks. Wood was then placed on these rocks and set on fire.</p>
      <p>When the fire burned down, moist grass was placed over the rocks, and the mescal bulbs placed on top of the grass. Grass was again laid over the bulbs and covered with dirt. After approximately 12 to 24 hours, the mescal was removed. Pulpy white centers of the black, roasted crowns were removed and spread out to dry. Alternatively, the roasted crowns could be carried for several months as a food source. This preparation of agave, repeated many times, appears to be the process that created the burned rock middens commonly found in the Plateaus and Canyonlands throughout much of prehistory. </p></td>

        <td valign="top"><h3>Family Life</h3>
          <p> Apache family life was close knit, and families tended to live together. 
            Since Apaches are matrilineal&mdash;where descent is traced through one&rsquo;s
            mother&mdash;the local group was typically an extended family where
            the fathers had married daughters or granddaughters of a woman, with
            each married couple keeping their own residence. Mothers and daughters
            were quite close, and much of their work (collecting, cooking, caring
            for children, etc.) was done together, further binding them during
            their lifetimes. Grandparents were often teachers of the young, teaching
            them skills and disciplining them to respect the customs and behavior
            of the group. Children of the same sex within the extended family
            were taught to cooperate, become close friends, and refrain from
            rivalry. Grandparents also taught the children that men married into
            the family protected their wife&rsquo;s family, provided food for
            them, and obeyed them.</p>
          <p>Several extended families lived in close proximity to each other
            and cooperated in obtaining food and defending each other. As the
            Apache were not sedentary throughout most of their history, families
            living near each other also tended to travel together. When encountered
            Juan O&ntilde;ate, the first governor of New Mexico, encountered the Apache on the Southern Plains,
            he described them as people::</p>
          <blockquote> <p><em>who live in tents of tanned hides among the herds of Cibola
              [buffalo]. The Apiches [sic Apaches} are infinite in number&hellip;.They
              live in rancherias, and from the few days I spent in their area,
              I have discovered they live like the people who live in pueblos.
              One [rancheria] located about 18 leagues from here has 15 plazas </em>[presumably,
              he meant 15 extended family groups].</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Typically, one man among the various extended families was perceived
            as the leader of the overall group. His leadership was based on his
            power to persuade the others to follow his directions. Individual
            families and/or persons were free to make up their own minds or to
            leave the group at will. Father Jimenez, a priest with many years
            working with other native peoples, was struck by the Lipan Apache
            when he labored at Mission San Lorenzo de Santa Cruz. He found them
            to be a proud people of great courage.</p>
          <p>Daily or seasonal tasks carried out by the families were jointly
            shared among both men and women, although some tasks were more frequently
            carried out by one or the other. Collecting nuts or vegetables (such
            as agave) was usually undertaken by women. While men were the principal
            hunters and made most weaponry and horse trappings, women (particularly
            the Lipan women) participated in rabbit and antelope hunting. Women
            made baskets and tanned animal hides for making tipis and clothing,
            but men were known to repair or make clothing, especially if it was
            an item they would use. </p>
          <p>Spanish observers in the 1600s noted that the Apache wore
            little clothing, but all was made from tanned hides, particularly
            the buffalo. Through time, clothing styles changed,and Apaches began using woven European
            cloth to make clothing in traditional styles. A Lipan man
            and woman, drawn by a member of the Berlandier expedition of
            1828 (see image by Lino Sanchez y Tapia, top of page<em>)</em>, illustrates  how clothing and other
            aspects of Apache customs incorporated European-made goods, but each within
            the overall Apache traditions. The man carries a rifle rather than
            the bow and arrow, but the rifle has a fringe placed beneath the
            barrel, reminiscent of fringes found on some bows. His loincloth
            appears to have been made from red cloth rather than hide, but his
            moccasins and the throw over his shoulder are from hides. The woman
            wears a shawl and skirt made of cloth, but her moccasins also are
            of hide.</p>
          <p>Use of cloth, weapons, and other items manufactured by the Spanish
            or Americans did not, however, fully replace traditional goods. Bows
            and arrows continued in use up until the late 1800s, and numerous
            formal portraits taken on reservations show Apache in traditional
            dress with traditional weapons. One item that was not typically manufactured
            by the Apache is pottery. Of the pottery at Mission San Lorenzo de
            Santa Cruz, only 48 pieces of broken pottery may relate to the Lipan
            for whom the mission was dedicated. Those sherds are from a large vessel with a smoothed surface that
            may resemble other vessels from the Southern Plains. Recent study
            of Chiricahua and Mescalero pottery confirms that pottery was not
            commonly manufactured by eastern groups of Apache. </p>
          <h3>Spiritual Life</h3>
          <p>Mescalero and Lipan spiritual life was rich and included many ceremonies.
            Both men and women were active participants in that aspect of their
            lives and women often served as shamans (medicine men). Girl&rsquo;s
            puberty ceremonies practiced on the Mescalero Apache Reservation
            today reflect the participation of both sexes and all age groups
            in the ceremony. Older women instruct the girls and care for them
            between their dancing in a specially erected tipi. These dances are
            accompanied by the chants of adult males. In between their dances,
            males chant while other males of the Clown Societies perform dances
            in the plaza outside the tipi. Families prepare food and drink in
            a pavilion adjacent to the plaza, and other members of the tribe,
            as well as the public, watch from the sidelines. Because there is
            much gift-giving during the ceremony and because it takes place over
            several days, this, like other ceremonies continues to solidify the
            tribe as one people</p>
          <p>The Apache believe in supernatural power &ldquo;that pervaded the
            universe and could be utilized for human purposes by ritual procedures
            known to priests or learned in personal revelation by shamans.&rdquo; Thus,
            many rituals revolved around curing sickness caused by sorcery or
            the anger of a higher being or because the ill person had committed
            a transgression.</p>
          <p>Death carries a number of important burdens in Apache life. Certainly,
            there is mourning among the immediate family. Ghosts, however, can
            return to inflict damage on the living. In the past, the family and
            others in a camp would depart as soon as the individual was buried.
            Later, all the possessions and items that might remind the family
            of the person were removed from the dwelling. When the person is
            elderly, however, these concerns were relaxed among the Lipan and
            Mescalero. Given the emphasis on grandparents as instructors, as
            the elderly approach their death they are sought out for advice and
            blessings.</p>
          <h3>Recent History</h3>
          <p> By the late nineteenth century, some Apache bands had settled in
            northern Mexico while those in the United States were placed on a
            series of reservations. The Fort Sill Apache Reservation in Oklahoma
            mostly held displaced Chiricahua Apache (part of the western Apache)
            although a few Lipan also resided on that reservation. The White
            Mountain Apache in Arizona are largely descended from the Gila Apache
            while the Jicarilla Apache of the Southern Plains descend from the
            Faraones. They were placed on a reservation in northern New Mexico.</p>
          <p>In 1873, President Grant signed the Executive Order establishing
            the Mescalero Reservation in southeastern New Mexico near Ruidosa.
            Today, the Mescalero Reservation is the &ldquo;official&rdquo; home
            of both the Lipan and the Mescalero. This reservation constituted
            a small fraction of the large region that the Mescalero and Lipan
            had previously occupied, but it was, at least, within their traditional
            lands. Over the next century, their people faced great challenges&mdash;extreme
            poverty, epidemics, military attacks, and intrusions from white settlers.
            In the early twentieth century, Lipan from Mexico were brought to the
            reservation; still others who had been interned at Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
            were brought to the reservation in 1913. Over the next decades and
            world wars, their people struggled.</p>
