<p>This site is at the mouth of Pressa Canyon. The pictures are on the curved surface of an overhanging cliff about 50 feet from the floor of the Canyon. Just beneath the pictures is a small ledge which made it possible to stand while copying the pictures. No. 2,3,4 and 5 are painted a convenient distance above the ledge, but No. 1 begins about 5 feet above the ledge and extends to such a height as to have made scaffolding or a ladder absolutely necessary for its painting. </p><br>

<p>The paint used on these pictures is the same deep red, common to the Dry Shelter Culture; but the figures are distinctly different and the paint is in better condition than one would expect to find Dry Shelter Culture paint, in the same exposed place. In fact, there are a few very dim red figures on No.2 that may be Dry Shelter Culture designs, but this is not certain. </p><br>

<p>Painting the figures at a dizzy height seems to have been a usual thing for this culture. At two other places, similar designs were found 10 or more feet from the ground. </p><br>

<p>Note the phallic figures on No.1. This feature is totally absent in the pictures of the Dry Shelter Culture. </p><br>
