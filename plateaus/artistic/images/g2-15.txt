<p>A few pictographs in black are still dimly visible on the back of the shelter. Only two marks and three crosses are in red. A few other pictures may have once been on the cliff, but now are only dim black splotches of color. It was necessary to wet the pictures before accurate copies could be made. A legend has grown up about the picture of the man with the long coat holding the gun. It is said to be the picture of a priest, who was killed by the Indians, and whose grave can still be seen a few hundred yards below the spring. </p><br>

<p>This design appears on the ceiling in the central part of the shelter, about 10 feet above the present floor level. It is of particular interest because the pictures appear to have been done almost entirely with crayon. The color is brilliant, but is laid over the smoke covered ceiling and doesn't show up very plainly. The body of several of the figures are lighter than the ceiling. They seem to have been coated with an application of light gray clay or mud.</p><br>
