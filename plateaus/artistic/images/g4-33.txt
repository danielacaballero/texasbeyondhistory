<p>All of the back wall is soft chalk except the extreme north end.  Here a part of a large group of paintings remains clear enough to copy.  The picture of the cats is still quite distinct, but the bottom part of the group has completely weathered away and is two or three inches below the hard surface on which the paintings were made.</p><br>

<p>No. 2 joins No. 1 at A, and A represents the floor level.  This is an unusually large group of cats.</p><br>
