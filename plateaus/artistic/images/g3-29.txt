<p>Nos. 1 and 2, Pressa Canyon, Site 1. About seventy-five feet long, the entire back wall of this low, shallow shelter was once covered with paintings, but only a portion of the designs at each end of the shelter were still clear enough to be made out. </p><br>

<p>No. 3, Pressa Canyon, Site 2. This shelter is below Black Cave, high up in the canyon wall. Part of the wall and ceiling has weathered badly; the remaining surface is almost completely covered with a grey lichen which has destroyed the pictures that once covered the entire wall. </p><br>

<p>No. 4, Lewis Canyon. A small canyon empties over the cliff below the mouth of Lewis Canyon on the east bank of the Pecos River. Water has worn out a circular shelter, in the center of which is a round hole of fresh water about twenty feet in diameter and very deep. These few pictures were painted on the smooth wall and are still quite distinct. This site is near a large petroglyph site (Plate 55).</p><br>
