<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>

<p>This site is a dry shelter high on the east cliff of the Pecos River. The shelter is about 200 feet long with about a 30 feet overhang. It has a 3 or 4 feet midden deposit of typical dry shelter culture. It had been partly dug by teachers of the Ozona High School and the material they secured, placed in the High School Museum. The local name, Bee Cave, comes from the fact that a very large hive of honey bees have chosen it for a home; and have deposited a large quantity of comb and honey on the open ceiling. The bees, fortunately, are the gentle kind and offered no resistance while we were copying the pictures. </p><br>

<p><strong>Pictures:</strong></p>

<p>The general surface of the cave wall is chalky and rough, unsuited to pictographs; but a small surface about 20 feet long at the lower end of the shelter was hard and smooth. The pictures were found on this surface. The designs in group No. 1 are all in black and are the first we have discovered of that kind. They resemble, somewhat, the carved designs at the mouth of Lewis Canyon, some twenty miles down the river. </p><br>

<p>No.2 is typical of the Dry Shelter Culture designs. </p><br>
