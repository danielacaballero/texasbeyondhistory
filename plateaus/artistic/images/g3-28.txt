<p>No. 3 These designs are only five yards to the left of Black Cave, under an overhanging rock cliff. They are badly faded and damaged by seep water. </p><br>

<p>No. 1 and 2 are under the same overhanging cliff; but about 100 yards to the left of the shelter. They have faded badly because of the exposure, but could be clearly made out. They are copied in about their original strength of color.</p><br>
