<p><strong>Pecos River site 5 No. 1.</strong></p>

<p>This site is a small shelter high up the east cliff of the Pecos River ... above Shelter 4. It was very difficult to reach and little evidence of occupancy was found. Large rocks from the ceiling almost completely filled the floor. </p><br>

<p>One design about 4 feet long had been painted on the back wall, but it had almost entirely weathered away. The design copied was found on the side of one of the rocks which had fallen from the ceiling. It had been painted, however, after the rock had fallen.</p><br>

<p><strong>Pecos River Shelter 7 No. 2.</strong></p>

<p>This site is a small shelter about 15 feet wide by 10 feet deep at the base of the cliff. It is semicircular, with a layer of ashes in the floor and the ceiling black with smoke.</p><br>

<p>The only pictographs were small designs in red and a couple of splotches in the same color that may have been hand prints. They were painted on parts of the ceiling where the soot had flaked off.</p><br>

<p>The principal designs in the shelter were scratched in the black ceiling with a fine pointed tool, and appear light against the dark background. The copy shows them in the reverse. Most of the designs had been smoked since they were made, and now appear grey were names and dates as far back as 1881 on the same surface are still fresh and white. The nature of the scratchy designs made absolutely accurate copying impractical. Only the general effect and the approximate location of each design was attempted. No attempt was made to represent every line correctly.</p><br>

<p><strong>Pecos River Site 6. No.3.</strong></p>

<p>This site is some distance up the second canyon, on the east side of the Pecos River. It is a flooded shelter with a hole of fresh water in front of it. The shelter could not have been used to live in, but the hole of permanent water was no doubt the water supply for the Indians who lived on the plain above, where burnt rock mounds and flint chippings were observed. </p><br>
