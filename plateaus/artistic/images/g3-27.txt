<p><strong>Location</strong></p>

<p>The shelter is ... just above high water level. It shows signs of long occupation and its ceiling is smoked very black, which accounts for the name. The canyon contains a spring which furnishes perpetual water.</p><br>

<p><strong>Pictures</strong></p>

<p>Pictures have been painted on most of the wall space within the cave, and on the ceiling in one place, but for some reason, the greater part of those in the center and at the right end are either completely destroyed or very dim; although those at the left end are still very clear. In fact three of the designs (No. 1, Plate 27) are still almost as brilliant as if recently painted. This, I believe, is due to the situation of the cave in relation to the prevailing air currents, which tend always to carry the dust and smoke away from this section of the wall and deposit it on the ceiling and wall to the right. The blowing rain and light have faded the group on the extreme left (No.1). Five small drawings which appear high on the wall are reproduced in a large scale, which is only approximate, because none of the drawings were low enough to be measured.</p><br>
