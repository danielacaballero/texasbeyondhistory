<p><strong>Lookout Shelter</strong></p>

<p>This shelter is at the mouth of the Seminole Canyon opposite Panther Cave. It is a long and shallow shelter with a very high overhang, which affords poor protection from blowing rains. The lower corner of the shelter ends abruptly high up the cliff and commands an excellent view of the Rio Grande River below, for some distance down the river. Also a view up the Seminole Canyon for some distance. The rocks at this point are worn slick as if by the feet of many Indians on lookout duty thus the name, Lookout Shelter. Only a few pictures had been painted on the wall. In the shelter, however, were several large rocks almost completely covered with grooves and tree like designs, evidently cut into the rock by the Indians sharpening the points of their tools.</p><br>

<p>These designs are in a shallow extension, to the right of the main shelter. A few pictures have been destroyed to the right of this group.</p><br>
