<p>This large shelter is in the west bank of Seminole Canyon. It is about 185 yards long and about 40 yards deep in the center. Pictures are almost continuous just above the floor level the entire length of the back wall, and some are found on the ceiling. Also an offset in the ceiling makes a second wall at the south end, just about as high as one can reach from the floor. This wall also contains pictures and because they have been protected by their height from the floor, they are the clearest in the shelter. At the north end the floor has been washed out for a distance of about 30 yards leaving the bottom of the pictures about 15 feet off the floor. This wall is extremely high and is covered with designs at least 15 feet above the original floor (see Plate 14.) Here the wall is exposed to the sunlight over half of the day and rain from the south and east, so consequently the paintings are rather dim but sufficiently clear to copy accurately. The pictures along the floor level on the back wall are almost completely destroyed by overpainting by the Indians, smoke, wear and tear from living against them and flaking of the rock. Parts of designs can be made out all along but none of them complete. Only one small section was sufficiently clear to be copied. About a third of the pictures on the second wall were too dim from age or smoke to be made out. The deer dance is on the sloping ceiling above this second wall near the south end and is quite clear (see No. 4.) My copies in all cases have been painted stronger than the design now appears. An attempt had been made to approximate the original colors the Indian used, judged by the places that are still clear. Nothing has been included that could not be clearly made out, however, lines and designs that are broken by flaking of the rock have been made complete, where enough still remains to be certain of the original position, otherwise they have been left out or blurred. Designs made up of the typical fringed square shouldered figures could almost be copied but so much of the finer detail is lost that it was passed up. No other ceiling designs could be made out. </p><br>

<p>No. l This design is low on the wall just outside the shelter at the left end and is very dim, due no doubt to its exposure to the sun and rain.</p><br>

<p>No. 2 and 3 appear on the second wall and were very dim. </p><br>

<p>No. 4 is one of the clearest groups in the shelter and by wetting in places could be copied very accurately. It is on the sloping ceiling above the second wall.</p><br>
