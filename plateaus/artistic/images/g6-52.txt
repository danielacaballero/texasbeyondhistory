<p>This site is at Live Oak hole on Cow Creek. It is a long low shelter just above flood water. Its ceiling is well smoked and there is a large burnt rock mound immediately in front of it.</p><br>

<p>The pictures are on the back wall near the floor and extend up until the highest figures are well over on the low ceiling. The principal design is a wavy snake-like line extending almost the full length of the shelter, 44 feet 6 inches. Its extreme length made it necessary to show it in two parts on the copy. </p><br>
