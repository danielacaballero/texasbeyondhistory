<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>

<p>This small shelter's ... floor is now uneven and about 10 feet below the bottom of the pictures, but it seems to have been level at one time and much higher than at present. Much of the design is on the ceiling and even when the floor was level it was from 10 to 15 feet above the floor, necessitating a scaffold for painting. </p><br>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

<p>The color was in very good condition and almost everything in the shelter is included in the copy. There is little doubt about any of the design, however, owing to the extreme height of the pictures, most of the measurements had to be judged by the eye. The method used on this shelter has proved very valuable in judging size on all pictures too high for accurate measurements. The length of the space to be copied was divided into four foot spaces and clearly marked by standing sticks against the wall, the paper was then divided into equal spaces according to the scale to be used. It was then easy to locate the exact position of a design on the paper and judge its size quite accurately. </p><br>

<p>No.3. This figure is only four feet from the floor and the copy is quite accurate.</p><br>
