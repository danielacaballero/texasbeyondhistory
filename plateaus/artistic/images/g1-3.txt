<p><em>Shelter 2 has been destroyed--possibly by the flood of 1954 (due to a stalled hurricane in the region).</em></p><br>

<p>About 200 yards up the canyon from the main shelter and on the same side are two other shallow shelters. They are about level with the bottom of the canyon and their rock bottoms are flooded with every rain. The first had a few very dim cliff dweller designs in the ceiling but they were much too dim to copy. The second contained a few very clear pictures and hand prints in bright red. They are no doubt comparatively recent or else the waters of the canyon would long since have washed them off. The very good picture of a horse puts them in historic time. Signs of a large open camp were found on the level ground above the canyon. These pictures probably belong to that culture. </p><br>
