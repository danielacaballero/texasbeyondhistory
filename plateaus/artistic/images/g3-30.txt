<p>There were five groups of pictures along the back wall. All of them were rather dim. The last group on the right consisted of two log-like designs and a splotch of red paint, which I decided were not worth copying. </p><br>

<p><strong>Pecos River. Shelter 4. No.5.</strong></p> 

<p>...All of the pictures clear enough to copy, are in the back of the shelter under the rock over which the water of the canyon above empties. Some pictures had been painted on the wall to the right of this space but they were in too bad a condition to be made out. The use of white on these pictures is of special interest. Note the sword-like designs with white handles.</p><br>
