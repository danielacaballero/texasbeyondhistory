<p>Nos. 1 and 2: Only about half of the original pictures could be made out.</p><br>

<p>No. 3: These red figures are in a small semicircular shelter in the east bank of the Pecos River.  They could be seen clearly from the west bank of the river which is very deep at this place, so no attempt was made to reach the shelter.  The designs were carefully copied through powerful binoculars, and their exact size, necessarily had to be estimated.</p><br>
