<p>The designs on this plate appear at the extreme upper end the shelter and far enough away from the creek to receive some protection from the flood water, consequently more of the Basket Maker designs can be made out, although they are extremely dim. </p><br>

<p>No. 9 All of the figures to the right of the little red animal belong to the Basket Makers. </p><br>

<p>No.10 Only the two solid red figures on the left belong to the more recent culture.</p><br>
