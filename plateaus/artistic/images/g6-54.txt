<p>The overhanging does not protect the pictures from the blowing rain and so they are very dim. Only three colors were used: black, and two shades of red. The hand prints are in brownish-red while the other designs are in a brighter purple-red. The hand prints are over painted by the other designs and appear to be considerably older. The top designs are too high to have been painted without a short ladder. </p><br>
