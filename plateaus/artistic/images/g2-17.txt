<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>

<p>Northeast of Langtry, Texas. The pictures are in small shelter in a deep canyon. The shelter is high up on the canyon wall about 100 feet from the bottom and very difficult to reach. It is only a long notch in the rock about 12 feet wide and 100 feet long. </p><br>

<p><strong>Pictures:</strong></p>

<p>They appear on the back wall of the shelter above a natural shelf three and one-half feet high and one foot wide. This shelf as well as the rocks in the floor of the shelter contain a number of round mortars. One on this shelf is 18 inches deep. A shallow midden deposit was on the shelter floor. The ceiling is so badly smoked that the tops of some of the designs are very dim and uncertain. The bottoms of the designs also fade into the background. Red, yellow and black paint was used. The detail of the clothing in these pictures is more carefully worked out than in any pictures previously copied. No white influence was noted. The work appears to be that of the basket makers. </p><br>
