<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>

<p>This site is a large deep shelter in the west bank of the Pecos River. The shelter is about 200 feet wide and 50 feet deep, with a back wall about 20 feet high. It has a smooth floor of debris which has been little disturbed but appears to be six or more feet deep. Pictures have been painted continuously over the back wall from the floor to more than 18 feet high in places; but those near the floor are so badly overpainted and damaged from being rubbed against that only a few can now be made out. The designs at the top are dim but sufficiently clear for copying. The exact color, however, was difficult to determine in some places because of the dust that has collected on them due to an oil which had been painted over the best designs; evidently by someone who wanted to intensify their color for photographing. (Plate 4) No. 1; (Plate 5); and (Plate 6) No. 1 join together to form a continuous panel.</p><br>
