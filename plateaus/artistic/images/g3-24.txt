<p><strong>Location (see Frontispiece)</strong></p>

<p>This section of pictures is in the center of the shelter and is badly over painted, but most of the designs are quite clear and can easily be separated from the overlapping pictures. Note especially the excellent drawing of the cat at the right. Also compare the solid fat figure beneath it with the figure on the extreme right of (Plate 25). </p><br>
