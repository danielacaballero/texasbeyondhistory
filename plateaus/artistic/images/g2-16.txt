<p>The shelter is rather small about 50 yards long with an overhang of about 30 feet. The floor contained a deposit of ashes and other camp refuse about two feet deep, which apparently had never been disturbed. </p><br>

<p>The culture seems to have been exclusively cliff dweller, although the work is extremely simple and wanting the elaborate polychrome found in many other shelters of this culture. There appears to have been two distinct periods of work: the first in flat tints of dim red, the second in simple outlines of dark red with two to three designs containing a pink background. A few simple designs on the last end of the wall are painted in a yellow ocher. No sign of white influence was found. Handprints were absent. The copy was made so that if corresponding letters on the five sections are placed together the group will be reconstructed in the proper relation. All the designs in the shelter were clear enough for copying and are included on the painting except a few small designs to the right of No.5, these were too badly weathered.</p><br>
