<p>Here is a case of color stratification which affords an unusual opportunity for comparing the ages of two cultures. At one time the Basket Maker designs, still dimly visible on the ceiling of the shelter, completely covered the back wall down below the feet of the figures in orange. The action of the water has removed almost all of the Basket Maker paint up to the high water level. Many years later the figures and animals at the bottom were painted by another culture, presumably before they had had contact with the white man, for there are no pictures of horses or other sign of white influence among their designs. These last pictures have also been exposed to the action of the water for at least seventy-five years, perhaps much longer, and yet they are sufficiently clear to be seen distinctly from a point up the canyon more than 300 yards away. Judging by this evidence, several hundred years must have elapsed between the painting of the Basket Maker designs and those of the orange red figures. </p><br>
