<p>The shelter is just below a spring in a small canyon known as Painted Rock Canyon which empties in the Rio Grande. The shelter is about 150 yards long, level with the creek, with permanent holes of water next to the back wall. It could never have been inhabited on account of this water. There is a large burnt rock mound on the first level bank in front of the shelter. On top of the hill in front of the shelter are many very old hearths. There was a number of mortars in the rocks about the shelter. </p><br>

<p><strong>Pictures</strong></p>

<p>The entire wall is smooth and suitable for pictures and there is ample sign that at one time the entire wall and much of the ceiling was covered with Basket Maker designs. These designs, however almost entirely weathered off up to the ceiling, due, no doubt, to the action of the water which covers the lower part of the wall at every rise of the canyon. A few designs can still be made out at the upper end of the shelter and in places on the ceiling.</p><br>

<p>A second painting of figures and animals by an entirely different culture has been superimposed over the Basket Maker designs. These figures are painted solid, in red only. Two large pictures of catfish are of special interest. Five negative handprints in the color of the last painting were found. No sign of white influence was observed.</p><br>

<p>No.1 The circle and lines in black and red are remnants of the Basket Maker designs over which the animals have been painted.</p><br>

<p>No.4 The circle containing the cross does not belong to the animal at the extreme right. It is underneath and probably belongs to the Basket Maker designs.</p><br>
