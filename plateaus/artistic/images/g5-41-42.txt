<p>The site is a small shelter high up the canyon wall facing west. The shelter is about seventy-five feet long and fifteen feet deep, and appears to have been used by the Indians for a long time. </p><br>

<p><strong>Pictures:</strong></p>

<p>Pictures once covered the entire back wall which is about six feet high, but only a few at the left of the shelter were clear enough to make out. Most of these are in a round recess in the wall which appears to have been used as a fire place. They are very dim. A fragmentary hand print at the bottom of the recess was made by scraping away the soot from around the hand, leaving a black print. </p><br>

<p><strong>No. 3</strong></p>

<p>The site consists of a small overhanging cliff on the north side of the canyon about 300 yards above the Adams ranch house. There is a burnt rock mound in front of the cliff.</p> 

<p><strong>Pictures:</strong></p>

<p>The pictures are on a rock surface under the cliff about ten feet long and eight feet above the ground. They can easily be reached by a shelf of rock below the pictures. They are exposed to the west sun and to blowing rain and are dim and badly flaked.</p><br>
