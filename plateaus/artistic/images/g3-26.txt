<p>No. 1: These figures complete the group of paintings under the main shelter in Panther Cave.  The panther picture is still remarkably clear. If its tail were extended straight instead of curving, it would measure nineteen feet from head to tip of tail.</p><br>

<p>Nos. 2 and 3: These pictographs are poorly protected under the overhanging cliff, just to the left of the main shelter. </p><br>
