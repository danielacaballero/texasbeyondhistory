<p>This little shelter is not on the main canyon but on the second little canyon that enters Seminole on the west. The shelter has a rock floor and is only about 30 yards wide and 15 feet deep. Water that comes down a little draw empties over the shelter and has caused the ceiling and wall to flake, damaging the Indian designs on the ceiling and back wall. With the exception of one zig zag line in ocher, the complete design is painted in a dark purple red. Parts of the design could not be certainly made out and were not copied. Five hand prints were made in a lighter red color and are probably not a part of the original design. The five fingered dots under the wavy line to the left are not hand prints. This work, though simple, is true Basket Maker. Contrast it with the designs above and on (Plates 42, 43, 44).</p><br>
