<p>The floor of this shelter is not piled up with debris as it is in many of the shelters, and the pictographs appear high up on the back wall. This has protected the pictographs so that every design is still complete except the left end of the black figure in the center of No. 2. This has been washed off by water from above. Gray dust had been deposited over the entire group, so that individual designs can not be clearly seen until treated with water. When treated, however, they appear clear and sharp as copied. The entire back of the shelter is covered with one continuous design, which has been reproduced at one-sixteenth scale on (Plate 10). When No. 2 is placed to the right of No. 1 so that the A's coincide the design appears just as it is in the shelter. This shelter shows only one age of paintings. No white influence is present and the deep coating of dust would indicate that these pictographs are very old. The design and color resembles that in No. 2, (Plate 9), and it seems reasonable to assign them to the same age.</p><br>
