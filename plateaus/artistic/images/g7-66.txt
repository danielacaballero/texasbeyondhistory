<p>No attempt has been made to express the natural color of the original rock.  All tints and colors shown besides this neutral grey are Indian paints.  The designs on the pebbles were carefully traced on cellophane, transferred to the drawings of the pebbles, and painted in about as strong colors as the Indian designs appeared to have been originally.  </p><br>
