<p>This site is just below Lewis Canyon. The location is especially suitable for an Indian camp because of the level ground above the river, which can easily be reached, and because of the fresh water afforded by a deep hole in the rock where a small canyon pours over the cliff of the river canyon. This level second bank is midway between the river and the top of the hills above. It consists of approximately 10 acres of level ground, about two acres of which is smooth flat unbroken rock, just level with the surrounding ground. Between this rock surface and the river are several burnt rock mounds and above it at the foot of the hills is much broken flint and signs of camping. </p><br>

<p><strong>Petroglyphs:</strong></p>

<p>Two areas of the smooth rock surface are covered with designs carved into the rock by the Indians. The designs were made by pecking shallow trenches in the rock. These trenches now are from one-eight to one-half inch deep and average about three-fourths inch wide. They were undoubtedly deeper originally, because there is evidence of considerable weathering. At present the grooves are filled with sand and a kind of dark lichen which helps make the shallow grooves more visible. Round holes have weathered about over the rock which were difficult to distinguish from cups made by the Indian. In some cases I am sure the Indians took advantage of these natural cups in making their designs. </p><br>

<p>The largest group of designs is at the east end of the rock surface. The remainder are 70 yards west just beyond a space now covered with sand and gravel. This sand appears to have been there when the designs were made so it is unlikely that any of the designs have been covered. </p><br>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

<p>Having never copied such a group of pictures before, it was necessary to work out a satisfactory procedure. Since practically every design was found in the two groups, it seemed desirable to make the copies, if possible, so every design in each group could be shown in its true relation to all the others. This was accomplished in this manner: a scale of 1/2 inch to 1 foot was chosen. This gave a 2 inch square on the drawing to a 4 foot square on the rock. </p><br>

<p>A complete board would accommodate a space 5 squares wide by 7 squares long, or 20 by 28 feet. Accordingly the group of carvings was divided by means of a tight rope into 20 by 28 sections and smaller, where less space would include every design. These sections were then marked off in 4 feet squares with chalk and corresponding sections marked off on the copying board. A plot of the different sections and their number on the copies was made by which they could be reassembled to make up the complete group of designs. Then each square of a section was taken, the designs in it carefully traced with the end of a stick so they could be readily seen and copied in the corresponding square on the board. In this way every design was easily found and accurately copied.</p><br>

<p>A compass was laid on each separate group of designs and the correct directions recorded. This was done for two reasons: first it makes it possible to get the correct angles of the separate groups when reassembling and second, it makes it possible to check the designs to see if for any reason they have been made so as to point in a particular direction. </p><br>

<p>The designs were accurately copied in pencil on the site and later painted in with black ink. The pencil outlines serve only in fitting together the sections of a group. Only three or four unimportant designs fell outside of the area included in the copies. These were disregarded.</p><br>
