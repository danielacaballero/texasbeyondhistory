<h1 align="center" class="style1">Forrest Kirkland: His Life and Work

</h1>
<p><em>&quot;In August of 1933 [Forrest and Lula Kirkland] attended a family
        reunion and fish fry on the Llano River a few miles below Junction, Texas.&nbsp; While
        Forrest and his father were examining arrowheads the children had picked
        up in a nearby field, the elder Kirkland told his son of some Indian
        rock paintings he had seen along a bluff above the Concho River near
        Paint Rock, some thirty miles east of San Angelo, when he had stopped
        there while on a fishing trip.&nbsp; ...[Forrest's] father urged him
      to stop and see them on his way back to Dallas.&quot; </em></p>
      <p>W. W. Newcomb, 1967</p>
      <p>And so began a 10 year study of the rock art of Texas Indians by Forrest
        and Lula Kirkland.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Forrest Kirkland's day job was running his own commercial art studio
        in Dallas.&nbsp; The art firm created catalog images for industrial companies.
        His air brushed drawings for machine catalogs were considered some of
        the best.</p>
      <p>Beginning
        with his first family, Kirkland traveled on vacations to paint landscapes
        in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. Many days on his walk
        to and from work, Kirkland stopped to quickly sketch Dallas scenes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In
        the late 1920s, Forrest developed an interest in geology and paleontology.&nbsp; Pursuing
        the interest led to weekend excursions and then camping trips.&nbsp; Forrest
        even discovered a new genus and species of jellyfish (<em>Kirklandia
        texana </em>Caster).&nbsp; Kirkland helped found the Dallas Fossil and
        Mineral Club, but soon turned to archeology as his main interest and
        helped organize the Dallas Archeological Society.</p>
      <p>Forrest divorced his first wife during this time and then married in
        1931 to co-worker, Lula Mardis.&nbsp; Lula, who trained at the Art Institute
        of Chicago, joined Forrest in his exploration of Texas' prehistory. At
        a family reunion, Forrest's father encouraged them to stop in Paint Rock
        to view Indian pictographs.&nbsp; Forrest and Lula both sketched what
        they found at Paint Rock.&nbsp; Over the winter, they decided to spend
        the next summer's vacation copying rock art.<strong></strong></p>
      <p>In 1934, Forrest developed his technique for copying the pictographs:
        careful measurement and scaling, pencil sketching, and then water coloring
        with matching colors. He didn't paint anything he couldn't see. His vision
        to preserve the rock art of Texas in watercolor became a mission. He
        would paint and Lula, his partner, would drive, scout, photograph, sketch,
        and cook. Lula performed most of the chores because Forrest's heart was
        weakened from childhood Rheumatic fever. </p>
      <p>Forrest
        Kirkland died from a heart attack on April 2, 1942, but not before Lula
        and he had copied all of the known major rock art sites in Texas. The
        Kirklands played an integral role in preserving the trail of pictographs.
        Forrest planned on writing and illustrating a book on the paintings.&nbsp; He
        had progressed as far as  mocking
        up the layout before his death.</p>
      <p>Their hard work has been recognized by scholars and universities. Forrest's
        paintings were shown in several locations in the U.S. before being acquired
        by the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM) at the University of Texas at Austin. </p>
      <p>One of the artist's dreams was to publish his work in a book on Texas
        rock art. His dream came true in 1967, when the University of Texas Press
        published<em> The Rock Art of Texas Indians</em>, featuring Kirkland&rsquo;s
        paintings and a text by W.W. Newcomb, then director of the TMM. Kirkland
        created the paintings, many of the rock art images he recorded have been
        destroyed or damaged. When Amistad International Reservoir was completed
        in 1969, many Lower Pecos rock art sites disappeared beneath the waves.
        Other rock art sites have been damaged by vandals or by natural disasters
        such as major floods. And all surviving rock art, particularly pictographs,
        are subject to continued natural weathering. The past continues to fade.
        Not only do Kirkland&rsquo;s paintings help document these sites, they
        also enable others to study them without hardships and offer inspiration
        to those who view them. </p>
      <p>Before he died, Forrest Kirkland created a mock-up of the book that
        he hoped to write.&nbsp; Using the watercolor sketches that he made on-site,
        Forrest would recreate the murals from the shelters in color.&nbsp; At
        the bottom of each mural, Forrest pasted Lula's black and white photographs
        to give the reader a sense of the countryside.</p>
      <p>Most of the watercolor copies of rock art that Forrest Kirkland made
        in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands are included in this virtual catalog.
        While Kirkland numbered his plates chronologically in the order he created
        them, W.W. Newcomb developed his own numbering system for the 1967 publication
        (reissued in 1996) in which the plates are geographically ordered. In
        this exhibit, Newcomb&rsquo;s organization is followed, making it easier
        for viewers to compare the gallery images to those in the published book.
        The Plate Directory<strong> [Link]</strong>cross references the two plate
    numbering systems. </p>
