<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>

<p>This shelter is the first one in the canyon. Its floor is rock and is level with the bottom of the canyon, the stream runs beneath the overhang and forms a pool under the shelter. The length of the shelter is 105 yards and the over-hang about 25 yards at the deepest place. The back wall is rather smooth limestone, rounding up from the floor and extending upward about 15 feet where it rounds into the ceiling. The pictures begin about 4 feet above the water level and extend to a height of 12 feet at one place. The entire length of the wall has been covered with pictures. </p><br>

<p><strong>Culture:</strong></p>

<p>The shelter could never have been used as a permanent living quarter, because of the stream in its floor. A burnt rock mound on the second bank in front of the shelter and many mortars in the shelter floor and in the rocks near by would suggest that it was used only as a shade by the Indians responsible for the burnt rock mounds. The uniformity both of the color and of the style seems to indicate that most, if not all of the drawings, were made by the same tribe of Indians. Perhaps this group of paintings will prove to be the type for the burnt rock mound culture age. The color is very dim and badly weathered, so that the pictures can only be made out with difficulty. This is due, at least in part, to the action of the water which must cover the bottom part of the pictures at every rise in the canyon. But the top most designs are also very dim, which would indicate extreme age. Many names have been written on the wall by visitors. One name in black paint at the bottom of the paintings, where the Indian paint is almost completely gone, is still very clear, although the date is 1882. A total absence of horses and other signs of white influence in the shelter confirms the other evidence of age.</p><br>

<p><strong>Color</strong></p>

<p>The very dim condition of the color now makes it impossible to say what its original shade was. Some form of red ocher was used on all but two or three designs, which were painted with yellow ocher. No black or white was observed. All pictures are in one color and no animal or human figure is drawn in outline. </p><br> 

<p><strong>Condition of Paintings:</strong></p>

<p>Not only has the color faded from age, but the action of the water and the dampness has caused the rock to flake until now the paintings appear rough like canyon drawings, although they were originally painted with liquid paint. At one place the red paint has almost completely flaked off leaving a yellow stain on the rock from which the pictures can easily be made out. This stain is evidently the result of the oil in the color soaking into the porous limestone. A white lichen is growing down from the ceiling and has begun to cover the paintings at the lower end of the shelter. This with the flaking of the rock and other destructive agencies will soon completely destroy this very fine group of Indian pictures. </p><br>

<p>No.1. Compare the two small animals facing each other at left end with the two on No. 3, (Plate 44). Also note the two long legged animals. None have been found before like them.</p><br>
