<p>This site is a medium-sized shelter at the mouth of the first Canyon on the west side of the Pecos River. It is very near the top of the cliff, but must be entered from below. The floor is level and consists of a deep layer of debris which has been disturbed on the upper end underneath the pictures. At one time almost the entire back wall was covered with pictures, but heavy soot has completely covered all except those at the west end of the shelter. Even the designs copied on this painting were badly affected by the soot, but they were still sufficiently clear to be readily copied. The designs above the center of the copy extend well over on to the rounding ceiling. The long designs in the center of the copy extend well over on to the right, are almost directly overhead. The use of white is especially interesting on these designs. The center shaft-like design was painted solid red and then covered with white opaque dots. The edge of the rock marked A on this painting and on (Plate 8), and the black figure to the left of it, are identical; and show how the two paintings fit together to make a continuous group of paintings.</p><br>
