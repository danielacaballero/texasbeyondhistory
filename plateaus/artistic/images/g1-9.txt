<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>

<p>The pictographs on (Plate 9) and (Plate 10) are on the back walls of four rock shelters in One Mile Canyon. Three of the shelters are near where the canyon empties into the Rio Grande and one, No. 3, (Plate 9) is in the rock cliff bank of the Rio Grande. </p><br>

<p><strong>No. 1</strong></p>

<p>This pictograph is all that remains of a large group in a very large shelter on the west side of One Mile Canyon a distance away from its mouth. The original group extended some fifty yards along the back wall from the south corner of the shelter. At this corner the pictographs are about ten feet from the floor where they have been protected, but about thirty feet from the corner the floor rises to within a few feet of the pictographs and from that point on, only indefinite smears of color remain.</p><br>

<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong></p>

<p>Since the bottom of the design is just about as high as one can reach it was not possible to accurately measure the height of the various elements in the group. However, the distance from the left to right was carefully measured and extreme care used in estimating the heights. The resulting copy should be sufficiently accurate for all ordinary comparisons and study. </p><br>

<p><strong>No. 2</strong></p>

<p>The pictograph extends on around the back of the shelter but the dirt and rock has accumulated until it is entirely covered up. The small section copied was only visible because it had been uncovered when a trench was dug along the wall. It is very dim being covered with gray dust and could only be copied while wet. The fact that these pictographs are covered with the accumulation on the floor of the shelter is very definite evidence that they are extremely old. ...Assuming that they were painted to within one foot of the floor level, which is most unlikely, it means that four or more feet of dirt and rock has been added to the floor of the cavern since the pictures were painted. It is the artist's opinion that the pictographs in this shelter belong to the very earliest period of its occupancy.</p><br>

<p><strong>No. 3</strong></p>

<p>This pictograph is on ... the Rio Grande River below the mouth of One Mile Canyon. The animal at the bottom and the bar to the right are quite clear but parts of the fringed figure and the black figure at the left had to be treated with water before they could be copied. Evidently the animals are much more recent that the figures at the top. Other designs had been painted at the other end of the shelter but they were too badly injured to be copied.</p><br>
