<p>No.1 The remarkable design on the left is very dim but was distinct while wet. </p><br>

<p>No.3 This small group is very dim. The birds were painted with a small brush, but the deer and plume-headed animals were made with a sharp crayon. </p><br>

<p>No.4 This is the only design appearing on the back wall sufficiently complete to warrant copying, although the wall is covered with paint for almost 300 feet. All of the other designs on the painting appear on the second wall.</p><br>

<p>No.6 These handprints are remarkable because they were made by painting a design in the hand and then stamping it on the wall. No other handprints were found in this large shelter and since the color is still very clear it would seem that they belong to a later culture than the rest of the pictographs here.</p><br>
