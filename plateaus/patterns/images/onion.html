<div class="caption">Wild onions were collected from along springs and streams. Properly cooked, they are a nutritious source of carbohydrates and other nutrients. These specimens were preserved in a dry rock shelter site. Charred onion bulbs and fragments also have been found in burned rock midden sites across the Edwards Plateau, where the bulbs were baked in earth ovens using hot rocks. Photo by Phil Dering.
