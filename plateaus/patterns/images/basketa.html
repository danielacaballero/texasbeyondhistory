<div class="caption">Loosely woven <strong>carrying basket</strong> found at another dry cave in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands.   This isn’t the same style of basket shown in the scene, but several different kinds of baskets, loose and tightly woven, small and large were made by the peoples of the canyonlands.  At the bottom of the photo is a close-up view of the weaving.  The small scale in the larger picture is marked in centimeters, showing that the basket is sizeable.   Simple, light-weight carrying baskets must have been quite useful for collecting plant foods and carrying them back to the cave.   TARL archives.
