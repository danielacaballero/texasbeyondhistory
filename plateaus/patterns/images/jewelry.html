      <p>Prehistoric peoples fashioned ornaments and jewelry from a number of natural items as shown in these specimens. Rather than mere adornments, there is little doubt that some “ornaments” had social and symbolic meanings.  For instance, large pendants of exotic materials may have symbolized authority and been worn only by certain members of society, perhaps male leaders.</p>
