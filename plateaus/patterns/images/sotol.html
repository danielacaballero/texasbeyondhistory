<div class="caption">The hearts (or bulbs) of fibrous plants such as sotol (shown) and lechuguilla were an important food for prehistoric peoples of the western Plateaus and Canyonlands. Although only the innermost leaf bases and hearts of these plants are edible, much like artichoke, they are only edible after prolonged baking for up to two days. This modern specimen was harvested by archeologists for cooking experiments.

<div class="caption">These charred fragments are part of the leaf bases of cooked sotol plants left behind when the cooks removed the edible and presumably properly baked hearts.  These specimens were preserved in Hinds Cave in the arid canyonlands of southwest Texas.  Photo by Phil Dering.
