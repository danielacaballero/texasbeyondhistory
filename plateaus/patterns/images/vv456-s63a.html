<div class="caption">Worn-out <strong>sandal</strong> from Hinds Cave.  Many sandals and sandal fragments were present in the Hinds Cave deposits, most were discarded after the were no longer useful.   Many sandals were made from lechuguilla leaves because the fibers were strong and resistant to wear.  Sandals would have made it easier to navigate across rough, rocky, thorny terrain surrounding Hinds Cave, even for people whose feet must have been tough as nails.  TAMU Anthropological archives.
