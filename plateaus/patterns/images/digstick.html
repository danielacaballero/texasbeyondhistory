<div class="caption"><strong>Digging sticks</strong> were an essential piece of equipment used by women and probably men, too.  And not just for digging: prying, reaching, poking, and any other task where a good heavy stick came in handy.  This composite photo shows a digging stick made of persimmon that was found at Hinds Cave.  On the left is the complete specimen.  On the right an archeologist points to the beveled working end.  At the bottom is a close-up view of the tip, showing the wear visible on the side opposite the bevel.  At the top is a close-up view of the rounded “handle” end of the tool—notice that it too is heavily worn from use. TAMU Anthropological archives.
