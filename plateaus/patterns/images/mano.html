<div class="caption">This <strong>mano</strong> or hand stone from Hinds Cave was used for grinding seeds, nuts, and other materials such as paint pigment.  Notice the slightly curved bottom (as seen in side A) with rounded edges.  This wear pattern is characteristic of grinding.   Side B shows the square shape and evidence of battering and pitting.  For hunting and gathering people, manos, like most tools, served many different needs.  These may have included cracking nuts, hammering a wooden stake, and many other daily tasks requiring a convenient hand-held stone.  TAMU Anthropological archives.
