<div class="caption">This “<strong>sotol pit</strong>” was visible on the surface of Hinds Cave
  when the archeologists first visited in 1974. Such pits were used for baking
  sotol and other plants that require prolonged heating before they are edible.
  Although the pit at Hinds Cave was not excavated, nearby archeologists encountered
  large quantities of sotol leaf bases and chewed quids. Visit the <a href="../../nature/plant.html">Plant
  Gallery</a>  to learn more about sotol. Quids are the chewed up ends of cooked sotol leafs—these are eaten sort of like artichoke leaves except sotol leaves are a lot tougher.   TAMU Anthropological archives.
