<div class="caption">This coiled <strong>rabbit net </strong>(close-up detail shown at bottom of photo) was found in another dry cave, but many small net fragments were recovered from Hinds Cave.  The nets were simple tied nets made from twisted cord made out of yucca and lechuguilla fibers.   The scene shows a stored net, similar to the one in the photo; we suspect equipment storage was one of the functions of the dry caves. Nets were probably also used for catching fish in the nearby river.  To capture rabbits, the nets were stretched across likely grassy flats in the uplands and the whole group joined in to chase the prey toward the net.  Men and boys stood behind the net ready to dispatch the unfortunate animals with sticks.  Bloody, perhaps, but effective.  Many rabbit bones were found in the Hinds Cave deposits.
