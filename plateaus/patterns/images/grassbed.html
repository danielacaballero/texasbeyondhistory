<div class="caption">This <strong>grass bed</strong> uncovered at Hinds Cave may not look very comfortable, but it would have done nicely.  Grass beds were shallow pits lined with green boughs (leafy branches) and  filled with layers of grass and sometimes worn-out sandals and mat fragments – anything soft.  In use the bed would have been topped with a woven mat.  Notice the oval shape of the bed. This one was probably used by an adult, but they weren’t big enough to stretch out flat.  The people who lived in Hinds Cave slept in the fetal position (curled up).  Most of the grass beds were found along the back wall of the cave in the flat central area.  (Ignore the rocks, they were obviously tossed in later after the bed was no longer in use.)  TAMU Anthropological archives.
