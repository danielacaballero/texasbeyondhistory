<div class="caption">This<strong> rabbit fur robe</strong> comes from dry cave in Pecos County in west Texas, but fragments of similar robes have been found in rockshelters in the vicinity of Hinds Cave.  Such robes must have been used by the peoples who frequented Hinds Cave during the cold time of the year.  In the scene an elder grandmother wears the robe, but it is still warm enough for kids to go around “natural” style.  Rabbit fur robes are made with dozens of strips of fur, wound around cords tied together together to form very warm garments.  Notice the cordage visible in the detailed view at the bottom of the picture.  TARL collections.
