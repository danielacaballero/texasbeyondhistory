  <div align="left">Ring Midden Sequence 1. This ring midden at site 41CX131 is in an early and somewhat peculiar stage of development. The baking pit is in the center and only the uppermost rocks are visible. The discontinuous piles of rock outside the central feature are a combination of spent cooking rocks cleaned out of the pit during earlier baking episode and, curiously, large, pristine, unused rocks. This is peculiar because it suggests that someone went to a lot of trouble to amass cooking stones in an advance of anticipated baking that never took place. Compare this with the later excavation photo. TARL archives.
