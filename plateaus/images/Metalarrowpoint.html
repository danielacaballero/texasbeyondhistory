<div class="caption">A metal arrow point collected by Jim Davis at the Hackberry Spring Site. Although some points were made by European manufacturers, many points were made by the native people themselves, although it required them to learn how to use new tools, such as metal files and chisels. The asymmetry of the point and hack marks on left side of the stem may indicate this point was native made rather than mass produced. Photo by Larry Riemenschneider.
