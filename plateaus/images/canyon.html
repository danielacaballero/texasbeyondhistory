<h1>Canyon Reservoir Sites</h1>
      <p>  With its sparkling clear waters and abundant wildlife, it is no wonder
        that the Guadalupe River valley in Comal County was a prime settlement
        area for native peoples for over 12,000 years. Open campsites, burned
        rock middens and rockshelters containing archeological remains are all
      present in the area and date to every cultural period of Texas prehistory.</p>
      <p> In 1949 archeologist Robert Stephenson undertook a brief reconnaissance
        of the section of the Guadalupe River valley that was scheduled to be
        inundated by the lake known today as Canyon Reservoir. Stephenson worked
        for the Austin office of the River Basin Surveys, a program of the Smithsonian
        Institution. At the time there were no laws protecting important historical
        and archeological resources, yet it was recognized that federally-funded
        dams would soon inundate hundreds of prime river basins across the nation.
        The Smithsonian&rsquo;s program was the first modest attempt to salvage
        some of the information that would soon be lost. Stephenson was a given
        a few weeks to search the area and he documented over 35 sites in the
        reservoir&rsquo;s flood pool area, a fraction of those that must have
        been present.</p>
      <p> In 1959, a small amount of federal funding became available for salvage
        excavations at Canyon Reservoir. Archeologists from the Texas Archeological
        Salvage Project at UT Austin carried out small scale excavations at three
        of the sites found by Stephenson. These sites were chosen because they
        had evidence of repeated occupations and intact stratigraphy (layering).</p>
      <p> The 1959-1960 Excavations at Oblate Rockshelter (41CM1), Footbridge
        (41CM2), and Wunderlich (41CM3), yielded nearly 2,400 stone tools from
        stratified deposits. Due to the poor preservation conditions at these
        sites, stone tools were about the only artifacts present. While this
        hindered the broader reconstruction of life at the sites, the large number
        of projectile points allowed investigators to reconstruct the chronological
        sequence of projectile points covering 6,000 years of central Texas prehistory.
        In 1960 archeologists had not yet worked out the basic chronology for
        the region, or sequence of changing point styles through time.</p>
      <p> Using data from Oblate Rockshelter and the Wunderlich site, archeologists
        LeRoy Johnson and Dee Ann Suhm created four groupings of dart points
        spanning the then-known extent of Archaic era, each representing a separate
        major time period. Although these groupings have been refined by later
        work in the region, the basic sequence of changing styles through time
        has held up.</p>
      <p> The Canyon Reservoir chronology and site excavation details were reported
        in a 1962 report that represents a milestone in Texas archeology. In
        the absence of material suitable for radiocarbon dating, projectile point
        chronologies provide a reliable means for estimating the age of occupations
        at archeological sites.</p>
      <p> In 1963, Dr. E. Mott Davis of the University of Texas led a group of
        70 volunteers back to the Oblate site for one week of additional excavation
        prior to the filling of the reservoir. This event was the second field
        school of the Texas Archeological Society, an annual training program
        that has held every year since. </p>

The black and white scale in the corner is marked in one-foot intervals, giving an idea of how deep the hand excavations went.  Based on what we now know, there were probably much deeper and older artifact-bearing deposits the archeologists never reached. TARL archives.
