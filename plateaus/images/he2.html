<h1>Misson San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz</h1>
      <p>Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz was a short-lived Franciscan mission
        established for the Indians at a large spring on the upper Nueces River
        in what was then the northern border of New Spain. Founded in 1762 by
        Franciscan missionaries, San Lorenzo was built for Lipan Apaches in hopes
        of pacifying their attacks along the northern frontier and as a way of
        maintaining Spanish control in the face of  threats by the French.
        The Franciscan friars also hoped to christianize the Indians they brought
      into their fold.</p>
      <p>Although it operated for a scant nine years, the Spanish fathers, along
        with Indian laborers, accomplished a massive construction feat at the
        wilderness outpost, erecting, in several stages, more than 14 buildings
        of adobe and limestone situated around a plaza. The complex included
        a church, sacristy, granary, cabins for the Indians, bastion, and a
        series of irrigation ditches for the nearby fields.</p>
      <p>With the exception of hand-wrought iron nails, all the building materials
        were made from local resources, including adobe mud, limestone blocks, oak and
        juniper timbers, lime made from local limestone in a nearby kiln, and
        sand, gravel and cobbles from the nearby Nueces River. The buildings
        and outer walls proved to be sufficiently strong to hold back repeated
        attacks by Comanches and other Indians. According to historic accounts,
        the Lipan Apaches at the mission were highly impressed with the granary,
        seeing it as a  place to take refuge during Indian attacks. </p>
      <p>The mission,however, was small, never officially sanctioned, poorly supplied, and unsuccessful in converting Lipan Apaches. Nine years after it was founded, the mission was burned and abandoned. The adobe structures began
        to deteriorate rapidly, although visitors, including historic Indian
        groups, continued to camp at the site. Between 1857 and 1861, the site
      served as a temporary U. S. military outpost known as Camp Wood.</p>
      <p>When archeologists from the Texas Memorial Museum began investigations
        at the site in 1962, they found that most of the walls of the mission
        had fallen into low mounds of crumbled adobe. Once excavations began,
        the archeologists uncovered hundreds of tons of construction and midden
        debris and found that most of the floors were intact.</p>
      <p>Although a relatively small number of people occupied San Lorenzo for
        less than a decade, a large quantity of pottery was used, judging
        from the thousands of sherds left at the site. Many of the ceramic vessels
        came from far afield&mdash;majolica from Puebla in central Mexico, olive
        jars from Spain, glass beads from Venice, salt-glazed stoneware from
        England, faience from France, and porcelain from the Orient. As archeologist
        Curtis Tunnell observed, &ldquo;Even this poor mission, one of the smallest
        and most remote of outposts, benefited from the world-wide trade network
        of eighteenth-century Spain.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>A surprising finding of the archeological investigations was that the
        Lipans, having been exposed to European influences for nearly 200 years,
        still practiced a number of native crafts and traditions. The trash middens
        inside the Indian quarters were littered with chipped stone tools&#8212;small
        knives, and scrapers&#8212;and a quantity of stone tool making debris. Archeologists
        also found a small amount of crude, locally made Indian pottery similar
        to that made by earlier Plains Apache groups of the Dismal River Aspect
        ( Nebraska and northern Plains areas).</p>
      <p>Under the church floor, archeologists found the burials of 17 Indians,
        11 of whom were women and children&mdash;possibly the victims of a smallpox
        epidemic that ravaged the mission in 1764.</p>
