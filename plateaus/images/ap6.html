<h1> <strong> Rush Site</strong></h1>
      <p>The Rush site (41TG346) in
        western Tom Green County was the scene of a very successful communal
        bison hunt by a large group of Toyah hunters in the late 16th century. Here
        at least 100 people&mdash;probably representing several bands&mdash;killed,
        butchered, and processed an estimated 50 buffalo over a several week
        period in fall at this locality on the floodplain of the North Concho River
        about 10 miles northwest of San Angelo. The archeological evidence of
        this event was extraordinarily well preserved and thoughtfully investigated
        yielding many insights into the lives of Toyah peoples during the waning
      decades of prehistoric life.</p>
      <p>The Rush site was investigated in 1993 by an archeological consulting firm,
        Mariah Associates, Inc., in advance of the construction of a large water
        pipeline. Although archeological excavations were confined to a narrow
        strip (the pipeline route) across the site, the researchers led by J.
        Michael Quigg made the most of the opportunity. Excavations encountered
        a thin occupation layer, estimated to date to about A.D. 1575, that had
        been gently buried by layers of mud and sand deposited during floods
        of the nearby river.</p>
      <p>Within the occupation layer were hearths, ash piles, ash lenses, lots
        of butchered and highly fragmented bison bones, and a variety of artifacts
        including arrow points, knives, hide scrapers, bone tools, and earthenware
        pottery. This well-preserved evidence allowed researchers Quigg and Jay
        Peck to piece together a remarkably complete story of what had taken
        place.</p>
      <p>After a successful kill event at or very near the site, the Toyah hunters
        and their families spent several weeks fully processing the harvest.
        They butchered the animals and almost certainly cut up much of the meat
        into thin strips that were dried for later use (no direct evidence of
        the drying was found). They scraped and probably tanned the hides. They
        also smashed the leg bones and rendered the valuable bone grease (fat)
        by boiling down the bone marrow and butcher&rsquo;s scraps in the earthenware
        pottery. In short, the Toyah peoples encamped at the Rush site took full
        advantage of their harvest. The bison yielded a surplus of meat, fat,
        hides, and other products (such as sinew, horns and tool-making bones)
        that must have been hauled to winter encampments elsewhere in the region.</p>
      <p>By averaging the results of multiple radiocarbon assays, the researchers
        believe the Toyah episode occurred in the late 16th century, probably
        about A.D. 1575, or a little over 400 years ago. While we can never know
        the precise year, given the nature of radiocarbon dating, we do know the bison kill
        took place in the fall season. The seasonality of the kill event was
        determined from a pair of complete bison mandibles (jaws) recovered from
        the site. The mandibles, which represent a single individual, provided
        an estimate of 2.5 to 2.6 years of age. As contemporary and historic
        accounts of bison indicate that most are born in April, this age estimate
        indicated a window between early October and the end of November for
        the time of death of this animal.</p>
      <p>All in all, the story of the Rush site is quite remarkable and it shows
        what can be learned through proper archeological investigation. The archeological
        collection and records are curated at TARL and will be available
        for future researchers to study in the future. In fact, an ongoing research
        project has already made use of pottery samples from the Rush site. Darrell
        Creel at TARL and several colleagues are attempting to trace the sources
        of Toyah pottery and the relationships among and between pottery samples
        from many sites in the region. The full research potential of the Rush
        site will probably not be realized for many, many decades. </p>

The radiocarbon assays shown here (such as 360 +/- 84, a radiocarbon-year age estimate) include several that seem too old to make sense; during analysis researchers look at the overall patterns and reject the aberrant assays.  (There are many reasons that affect the accuracy of radiocarbon age estimates, which is why multiple assays are needed to evaluate the age of a site deposit.)
