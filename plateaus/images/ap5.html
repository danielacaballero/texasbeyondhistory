<h1>Wilson-Leonard Site</h1>
      <p> This deeply stratified site in the Brushy Creek valley of southwestern
        Williamson County contains evidence from <strong>every prehistoric time
        period in Texas, </strong>the most complete single-site record of its
        kind for the southern periphery of the Great Plains. The Wilson-Leonard
        site (41WM235) evidences a succession of ancient peoples&mdash;from early
        Paleoindian Clovis cultures to Late Prehistoric Toyah folk&mdash;practiced
        a hunting and gathering lifeway throughout nearly 13,500 years. For the
        last 8,500 years of that time, campers at the site also used earth-oven
        cooking technology to cook bulbs from tuberous plants as well as other
      foods.</p>
      <p>The site was excavated in the early 1980s by the Texas Department of
        Transportation in advance of construction of Ranch-to-Market Road 1431.
        Roughly ten years later, archeologists from the Texas Archeological Research
        Laboratory, led by Michael B. Collins, returned to the site to do further work. Using a host of new
        technology and research methods, the team gleaned significant new information
        on human ecology, chronology, and paleoenvironmental changes. Among the
        more significant findings of the TxDOT/TARL excavations are:
  <ul class="typical">
    <li>Recovery of an early human burial, one of the oldest and most complete
      in North America. The individual—a  young female—was somewhere between 18
      to 25 years at time of death. She was buried roughly 11,000 years ago (9000
      B.C., or 9500 radio carbon years B.P.) in a shallow grave with a worn
      grinding-chopping tool  placed at her side and a large limestone boulder
      above her, perhaps to hold a hide wrapping. Archeologists nicknamed her
      Leanne (or the "Leanderthal Lady"), in reference to the nearby town of Leander, Texas.
      (See <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/plateaus/prehistory/images/leannes.html" target="_blank">Prehistory/Leanne's Burial</a> for more detail.)</li>
    <li>Documentation of a newly identified cultural component—that encompassing
      the Leanne burial—and including several limestone hearths, pits (possibly
      for storage or boiling foods with hot stones), and a variety of tools, including
      grinding stones and Archaic-style, corner notched stemmed projectile points
      referred to as Wilson. Evidence from the Wilson occupations wedged between
      two lanceolate point zones more typical of  the Paleoindian  indicate that
      the transformation to Archaic subsistence strategies was not a linear process.
      Different but contemporaneous lifeways were played out in various locations
      across the south-central U.S. as early Holocene peoples experimented with
      different technical and social strategies to cope with environmental changes.</li>
    <li>Recovery of possible pre-Clovis evidence (a handful of chipped stone artifacts
      including modified flakes and a biface, possibly in secondary context)
      and a probable Clovis component comprising tools with strong Clovis
      technological affinities and dating to ca. 11,500 B.C.).</li>
    <li>Indications of greater complexity and variability in Paleoindian projectile
      point styles than previously known. Based on statistical analysis of
      unfluted lanceolate forms from the site, a new type, St Mary's Hall, was
      proposed for points previously identified as Plainview. </li>
    <li>Evidence recovered from an enigmatic "Bone Bed" component  suggesting
      that Folsom and Plainview intervals may be more contemporary than sequential.
      The component appears similar to Folsom in terms of lithic technology
      (eg., ultra-thin bifaces) and association with bison, but it dated
      to approximately 11,400 to 11,000 B.C., earlier than Folsom, and contained a
      single unclassifiable, unfluted projectile point.</li>
    <li>Documentation of a 11,000-year-long sequence of burned rock cooking features
      (more than 200), beginning with small cooking hearths with a few stones
      and shifting to larger, more complex hot-rock appliances. By 7,000
      B.C., the site saw the development of fully developed earth ovens used for
      baking a variety of foods including camas (wild hyacinth) bulbs, a likely
      staple for Early Archaic campers.</li>
    <li>Recovery of a variety of data toward a regional paleoenvironmental sequence
      (based on physical stratigraphy, macro- and microfauna, diatoms, ostracodes,
      plant remains and carbon isotopes). </li>
