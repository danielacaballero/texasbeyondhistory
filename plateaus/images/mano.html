<div class="caption">A mano, or hand-held grinding stone, observed at 41GL92. This rather beat-up tool was found near the observed bedrock grinding surfaces. Like pestles, manos were often made of unusual or non-local stone types. In this case, the mano appears to be made on a piece of granite porphyry, and does not appear to be from the immediate area of Enchanted Rock. Also of interest on this tool are shallow depressions on each side of the artifact. These are commonly called “nutting facets” by archeologists, referring to the possibility that these sockets were used for cracking (shelling) acorns, walnuts, and other nut crops.
