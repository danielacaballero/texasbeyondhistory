<div class="caption">Elsewhere in the region, limestone bedrock is the norm and bedrock mortars look quite different. These examples from site 41KM144 in Kimble County near Junction were documented during a field school held by the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (STAA). After carefully mapping, drawing, measuring, and photographing the four deep mortars and four shallow grinding basins on this boulder, several experiments were carried out to learn more about how these curious features formed. The wooden pestle was made by the archeologists, but it is probably similar to those used long ago by the women who once claimed this processing station. Courtesy STAA. </div>
