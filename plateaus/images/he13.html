<h1>Los Almagres, the Lost Spanish Mine</h1>

      <p> Silver! Enough for every person to own a silver mine! So wrote Bernardo
        de Miranda y Flores in his 1756 report to the Spanish provincial governor
        after visiting Cerro del Almagre and Los Almagres, a mine near the Llano
        River. Almagre is a Spanish word that means &quot;ochre&quot;, and Cerro
        del Almagre means a Mountain of Ochre. Ochre is rock composed of concentrated
        iron oxide minerals and is sometimes associated with precious metal ores&mdash;including
        silver. In 1753, a small group of Spaniards excavated a pit at this site.
        Later, the governor asked Miranda to visit and examine the site. Miranda
        cleared the pit, extracted samples, and had them assayed. Although the
        results showed little silver, Miranda was convinced that silver-bearing ore could be extracted in large quantities because of the extent of iron
        oxide rock he observed. Unfortunately for the Spaniards, this land was
        occupied by Apaches who killed prospectors in the area during the next
      few years.</p>
      <p> In 1757, a presidio was constructed along the San Saba River near the
        present town of Menard, a few miles from Mission Santa Cruz de San Sab&aacute; (see associated Historic Encounters exhibits on these sites).
        The mission was attacked and destroyed by Comanches in 1758, and the
        presidio was abandoned. Although there were several visits to the Los
        Almagres area during the remainder of the century and into the 1800s,
        little actual prospecting for silver took place, and Miranda's site,
        Los Almagres, was essentially lost. Unfortunately, Stephen F. Austin
        showed San Sab&aacute; presidio to be the location of a silver mine on
        a map he published in 1829.</p>
      <p> The silver deposits were thought to occur in an area from around the
        San Saba River southward beyond the Llano River, and eastward to the
        Colorado River. Because of the rumors of silver and Austin&rsquo;s map,
        prospecting occurred throughout the area and treasure hunters abounded,
        mostly searching in the presidio area. Sporadic searches for Los Almagres
        continued into the early 20th century with at least one site thought
        to be the Spanish Colonial site, located in the Riley Mountains just
        north of Honey Creek.</p>
      <p> In the 1970s, an area rancher discovered a group of mines on his property
        along the southern slopes of Packsaddle Mountain, just south of Honey
        Creek, a short distance southwest of the Llano River and near its confluence
        with the Colorado River. He asked Christopher Caran, a consulting geologist,
        to investigate the mines. In 1999, Caran organized a group of geologists
        and archeologists to do so. Using information from on-site examination
        and archival resources, two archeological sites were recorded on the
        property. A third site was recorded on an adjacent property further north
        on Packsaddle. Field investigation included metal detector surveys and
        examination of the surface, the interior of shafts, tunnels, open pits,
        and modified natural caves. Spoil piles were found at all of the excavated
        features.</p>
      <p> In the largest site, one feature contains a deep shaft with a side
        tunnel far down inside the shaft. Another feature includes a deep shaft
        accessed directly from the surface and by a second entrance with a tunnel
        leading downward to the shaft (see plan and profile maps, above). There are side tunnels at three levels.
        A third feature consists of a long tunnel and a shorter side tunnel cut
        into the side of a hill. Pick marks and drill marks were observed near
        the entrance. Artifacts included cut nails, a broken pick point, and
        a chisel. A concentration of cut nails at another feature indicates a
        probable structure. Cut or wire nails were noted in various tunnel walls
        throughout the site. </p>
      <p>The second site contains several excavations, including
          a shaft and a modified natural fissure, as well as the remains of a brick
          smelter. The surface of the fissure contains anchor points for a cable-hauling
          system to transfer ore to the smelter. The third site includes three
          modified natural caves with excavated side tunnels. A probable gunpowder
          can was found in<strong></strong> one cave.</p>
      <p> Although few artifacts were available for dating, a number of characteristics
        in the excavations also were used to suggest approximate time periods
        for many of the excavations and to determine if any could be Los Almagres.
        Changes in mining technology were evident, from early hand-excavations
        using <em>barras</em> and picks, and removal of the rock from the mine
        manually, to the use of dynamite and removal of the materials by mechanical
        means. This change also resulted in a difference in the spoil materials:
        Spanish Colonial miners broke out rock in consistent sizes, which would
        be carried out, piece by piece,  through the shaft Typically the hauling was done by  young boys, who could pass more easily through the smaller passages. However, the adults would have had to wield the heavy barras. Later
        techniques, involving dynamite, resulted in angularly fractured rock
        pieces in a wide range of sizes. The changes from wrought iron to high-quality
        steel, and from cut nails to wire nails, provide estimates of the times
        when the associated excavations occurred.</p>
      <p> Another possible means of assessing  the age of activity at the mines&mdash;or at least the spoils areas&mdash;may
        derive from a lowly organism growing on the rocks: <strong>lichen</strong>.
        By correlating the <strong>maximum size</strong>        of lichen on spoils rocks with the average annual <strong>growth rates </strong>of lichen, an approximate age of
        the rocks may be determined. For example, by using a conservative average growth rate
        of  .02 cm per year and noting that it has been over 200 years since
        the time of Los Almagres, the maximum size of lichen on some rocks in spoil areas would be expected by now to be about 13 cm (5 inches). This is, in
        fact, what is seen on some of the spoil materials. While this particular correlation may be serendipity, it is nonetheless an interesting starting point for a new research approach. </p>
      <p> In all, three time periods are indicated in the sites examined: the
        Spanish Colonial period of the 1700s and early 1800s, the Mexican and
        Early Anglo period of the middle to late 1800s, and the later Anglo period
        of the early 1900s. Several features appear to have been worked during
        two or more of these periods.</p>
      <p> English translations of Miranda's journal describing his route to Los
        Almagres, with reported landscape features along the way, indicates the
        route most likely led to Packsaddle Mountain and the adjacent Honey Creek.
        Although archival research, fieldwork, and analysis are still in progress,
        it appears that at least one or two mine features could be the Spanish
        Colonial mine Los Almagres. Evidence so far suggests there never were
        economically important silver deposits in this area. </p>
