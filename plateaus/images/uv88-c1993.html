<div class="caption">View across the Woodrow Heard site.  The Dry Frio River flows left to right in this photo.  The bright white areas along the river are gravel bars flanked by two permanent pools of water that never go dry, even during the worst droughts.  Across the river, the terrain rises quickly to cedar-covered hills. On the near side of the river, the archeological site occupies much of the large floodplain, now used for agriculture.  Notice the curving dark green swale in the middle of the ploughed field that parallels the river.  The swales marks an old river channel that was abandoned by 6500 years ago (4,500 B.C.).
