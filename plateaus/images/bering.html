<h1>Bering Sinkhole</h1>
      <p> Bering Sinkhole (41KR241) in northwestern Kerr County is a natural
        sinkhole that was used as a cemetery by native peoples for over 5,500
        years from the latter Early Archaic to the Late Archaic periods. Human
        remains and burial offerings from the sinkhole provided a glimpse at
        the health and beliefs of hunting and gathering peoples living in the
      central Edwards Plateau.</p>
      <p> The sinkhole was discovered by accident while brush was being cleared
        along the property line between two ranches in the central portion of
        the Edwards Plateau about 20 miles southeast from Junction. Sinkholes
        are fairly common on the Plateau&mdash;they form as solution cavities
        in porous limestone bedrock. In this case, the landowner found an oval-shaped
        opening measuring some 7-x-12 feet from which a dead tree protruded.
        Beneath this was dark hole that proved to be a vertical shaft filled
        to within about 10 feet from the surface. To satisfy his curiosity, the
        landowner landowner used a track hoe (Iarge backhoe) to probe into the
        fill from the opening above. Animal and human bones and several Indian
        artifacts were found in the soil removed from the sinkhole, prompting
        the landowner to contact area universities to find someone who could
        examine the finds.</p>
      <p> As a result, archeologists from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
        conducted hand excavations at Bering Sinkhole between 1987 and 1991.
        The site materials were analyzed and reported by Leland C. Bement as
        part of his Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Texas at Austin and
        later published through the University of Texas Press. Bement undertook
        a multi-disciplinary analysis of the sinkhole and the materials recovered
        from within. The human remains from the sinkhole were studied to reconstruct
        the diet and demographic patterns of the Archaic-era hunter-gatherers
        who used the sinkhole as a cemetery.</p>
      <p> Below its shaft entrance, Bering Sinkhole opens into a somewhat larger
        chamber (12-x-40 feet) at least 25 feet deep that was two-thirds filled
        natural sediment containing human remains, animal bones, and some artifacts
        including apparent grave offerings as well as tool-making debris that
        may have washed in from the surface around the sinkhole opening. The
        human remains were found within various fill layers; most were scattered
        and did not appear to have been placed within grave pits.</p>
      <p> The uppermost fill layer containing human remains lay some 16 feet
        below the surface. As access into the sinkhole is only possible with
        the aid of ladders or ropes, it is believed that the deceased were probably
        lowered or simply dropped into the sinkhole. In some cases, bodies were
        apparently covered with limestone blocks intentionally dropped into the
        sinkhole.</p>
      <p> Based on the limited excavations, Bement estimated that at least 62
        people and possibly upwards of twice that many may have been buried at
        the site between about 5000 B.C. and A.D. 500 (Early to Late Archaic
        periods). The deceased ranged in age from infants to adults at least
        50 years old. The burials included at least six adult cremations and
        one adult bundle burial. The gender of the interred individuals seems
        to have been equally divided between both sexes, based on the remains
        of 11 males and 11 females recovered from the site.</p>
      <p> Most of the individuals buried at Bering Sinkhole were judged to have
        lived healthy and disease-free lives. Special isotopic analysis of human
        bone samples revealed that the native peoples represented by the cemetery
        depended more heavily on carbohydrate-rich plant foods than meat. In
        other words, gathering provided more of the diet than hunting.</p>
      <p> Some of the interments in Bering Sinkhole were accompanied by offerings
        of utilitarian or personal items such as stone tools as well as ornaments
        and ritual items such as bone and shell beads, marine shell pendants,
        bone hair pins, and a freshwater turtle shell possibly used as a hair
        ornament. Deer antler fragments, some of which were burned, may represent
        whole antler racks used as ritual offerings similar to those placed over
        Late Archaic graves at the Olmos Dam site in Bexar County. A cache of
        14 large bifaces and one stone drill recovered from the Bering Sinkhole
        probably represents another type of special ritual offering, estimated
        to date between 2250 and 650 B.C. Ten dart points found in the sinkhole
        could represent offerings, but some may have been imbedded within the
        interred bodies.</p>
      <p> Prehistoric cemeteries are relatively rare on the Edwards Plateau in
        contrast to the coastal plains of southern and southeastern Texas. Bering
        Sinkhole probably helps us understand why large open cemeteries are not
        found in the Plateaus and Canyonlands region. Native peoples appear to
        have used natural sinkholes for burial locations. Based on what is known
        about the beliefs of native peoples in the American Southwest and Northern
        Mexico, such natural cavities were probably regarded as symbolic entrances
        to the underworld. Thus, the bodies were not merely tossed into a convenient
        hole in the ground; the deceased were ritually placed within a sacred
        passage to the ancestral world and accompanied by offerings and blessings.</p>
