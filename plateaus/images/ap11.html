<h1>Mittel Site</h1>
      <p>  This fascinating site contains a small sinkhole cemetery and six burned
      rock middens.Located about 30 miles south of San Angelo in north-central
        Schleicher County, the Mittel site (41SL15) is a welcome exception to
        the general dearth of well documented archeological sites on the western
        Edwards Plateau. Unlike most other sinkhole cemeteries known in the region,
        the one at the Mittel site is located side-by-side with a rather ordinary
        work place&mdash;a plant baking facility, known to archeologists as
      a burned rock midden.</p>
      <p>The sinkhole cemetery was found by accident when the landowner attempted
        to eradicate a rattlesnake den inside the natural hole in the limestone
        bedrock. Clearing out the hole to make sure he had finished off the snakes,
        the rancher discovered human bones, bones he could plainly tell were
        very old. He called in archeologists from the Texas Archeological Research
        Laboratory to investigate. A small group of researchers and archeology
        students led by Darrell Creel carried out extensive survey and limited
        excavations in 1988 and 1989 at the Mittel site. Within the narrow confines
        of the sinkhole, they documented the remains of at least five individuals
        dating to the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period (after A.D.
        1300).</p>
      <p>The layering of the sinkhole deposits indicate that the human remains
        were interred after the formation of the adjacent burned rock midden,
        but it is not known if this midden or others nearby were still in use
        at the time of the burials. As explained in more detail in the <a href="../../bowie/index.html">Camp
        Bowie exhibit</a>, burned rock middens are specialized plant-baking facilities.
        The juxtaposition of an ordinary work place and a special place where
        loved ones were buried is probably more an accident of nature rather
        than a purposeful choice. Clearly, the area had a concentration of the
        targeted baking plants; while the Mittel middens were not excavated,
        we know from other sites in the general region that the targeted plants
        may have included prickly pear cactus, sotol, yucca, and wild onions.</p>
      <p>The Mittel site is an excellent example of cooperation between private
      landowners and professional archeologists. Data recovered from the site
      has the potential to tell us a great deal about economic patterns, social
      organization, and changes in how people used the landscape use over prehistoric
      time on the western Edwards Plateau. </p>

Burned rock middens are plant processing facilities and are common throughout west-central Texas.  TARL archives.

If so, no evidence of European artifacts were found at this site.   TARL archives.
