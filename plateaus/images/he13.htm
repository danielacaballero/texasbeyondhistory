<h1>Los Almagres, the Lost Spanish Mine</h1><img src="packsaddles.jpg">
<div class="caption">The Packsaddle Mountains shine with a golden light at sunset, a spectacle that was described in the diaries of Spanish expeditions in search of gold and silver promised by native informants. The remains of several mine shafts, along with several early mining tools, has convinced archeologists and geologists that the Packsaddles are the site of the fabled“lost silver mine,” Los Almagres.

      <p>Promises of riches attracted both Spanish prospectors and later American miners in search of silver and gold to the Central Texas area. The Central Mineral Region of central Texas has a complex geology. The rugged Packsaddle Mountains near the Llano River contain veins of ore that have attracted prospectors several centuries.</p>
      <p>When*** came to the Gov of New Spain with tales of veins of ore, a party was sent to investigate the claim. So confident were they of success that a presidio and mission were established in the heart of Lipan Apache territory. By converting the Lipan to Christianity, the reasoned, they would not only subdue the native peoples but gain their labor for work in the mines.</p>
      <p>Litle is known about the outcome of the venture. Some diaries tell of ore samples being sent back to Mexico to be assayed. What is known is that the mine was not as rich as promised. Since the mine was abandoned, countless geologists and prospectors have scoured the region for ore; some have been successful, starting small mining operations such as the ***. But the site of the famed Los Almagres was a mystery, until University of Texas historian Herbert E. Bolton calimed to have found the location on the banks of Honey Creek, in the shadow of the Packsaddles.</p>
      <p>Not all were convinced, however, and the lost mine continued to pull at several landowners in the Llano County area. With the investigations of Chris Caron, a geologist and specialist in Spanish Colonial mining, the mystery may have been solved. Both the building techniques in the shafts in the Packsaddle site as well as the type of tools found near the opening convince him of the mine&rsquo;s antiwquity.</p>
      <p>Whether we can state with certainty that Los Alamgres has been re-discovered after more than 300 years awaits further work at the site. </p>
