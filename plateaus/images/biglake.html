<h1>Big Lake Bison Kill</h1>
      <p> Sometime around 7000 B.C., hunters drove at least 10 bison into the
        mucky waters of Big Lake in southeastern Reagan County on the far western
        Edwards Plateau. The bison became mired in the bottom of the shallow
        playa lake and were dispatched by the ancient hunters. The hunters appear
        to have taken the best cuts of meat away to their nearby camp on higher
        ground. A prolonged dry period in the millennia following the bison kill
        caused the lake to dry up and wind blown dunes formed on the north side
      of the lake, covering up the bison bones.</p>
      <p>Big Lake is an intermittent saline lake or playa, the largest in the
        Plateaus and Canyonlands region. Today Big Lake is a dry depression most
        of the time; during the 20 th century it has held substantive amounts
        of water on average about once every 20 years following heavy rains.
        Before 9,000 years ago, Big Lake held water more consistently and formed
        a large shallow body of water that attracted animals and humans. After
        that time, the lake dried up and a massive sand dune formed on the north
        side of the lake as the result of southerly winds eroding and redepositing
        the fine lake bed sediments.</p>
      <p>Archeologists from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory began
        systematically surveying the area around Big Lake in 1988 in advance
        of the construction of a crude oil pipeline. They discovered the Big
        Lake Bison Kill site (41RG13) when they noticed a few large mammal teeth,
        chert (flint) flakes and a dart point lying on the ground surface. It
        was assumed that these materials had been unearthed during construction
        of a gas pipeline some years earlier. An exploratory backhoe trench was
        dug to evaluate the deposits.</p>
      <p>The trench encountered a bison bone bed, which yielded a single radiocarbon
        date of about 6,400 B.C. Hand excavations were carried out to sample
        the bone bed during several short field seasons in 1989-1993 under the
        direction of Solveig A. Turpin. Archeologists from the University of
        Texas at Austin were assisted by volunteers from the Concho Valley and
        Iraan archeological societies. This work yielded two additional radiocarbon
        dates ranging from about 7100-7400 B.C.</p>
      <p>None of the three dates from the Big Lake Bison Kill site were run on
        ideal materials (such as wood charcoal), hence the precise dating of
        the kill event remains uncertain. Nonetheless, the available dates and
        a fragmented Late Paleoindian dart point found in the bone bed suggest
        that the bison hunting event occurred at the transition between the end
        of the Paleoindian period and the beginning of the Archaic period, about
        9,000-10,000 years ago .</p>
      <p>The Big Lake bison remains have the potential to tell us a great deal
        about hunting behavior in this transitional period. Many Paleoindian
        hunting sites in the Southern Plains and American Southwest have been
        found near playa lakes. It has been postulated that hunters intentionally
        drove their prey into these lakes in order to bog them down and kill
        them. While this theory is generally accepted, there has been little
        direct evidence to back it up. At Big Lake, bison leg bones were discovered
        standing vertically in the archeological deposits providing proof that
        the animals were mired in the lake bottom when they were killed. Given
        that no butchering tools were found at the site, researchers believe
        that hunters carved off the choice bison parts (tongue, horns, hind quarters,
        etc.) and took these back to their camp for further processing.</p>
      <p>Analysis of the bison bones revealed that there were at least 10 individual
        animals represented in the bone bed, including three adult females, five
        juveniles and two calves approximately five months old. Since historic
        accounts of bison show that most calves are born in April, the Big Lake
        bison kill probably took place in late summer or early fall.</p>
      <p>In terms of both geography and time, the Big Lake Bison Kill site helps
        to fill a gap in the archeological record of Texas. The site is situated
        between the well known bison kills at <a href="../../lubbock/index.html">Lubbock
        Lake</a> and <a href="../../bonfire/index.html">Bonfire
        Shelter</a> and is dated to a transitional time between the end of
        the Paleoindian period and the beginning of the Archaic.</p>

The two fragments (both faces and cross-section of each shown) do not fit together, but appear to be from the same point.  The point was probably broken on impact, presumably when it encountered a bone within one of the bison.  The dots show the extent of edge grinding, a characteristic of lanceolate Paleindian points.
