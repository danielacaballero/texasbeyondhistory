  <div align="left">Landscape, Dry. This photo taken at site 41CX217 in Musk Hog Canyon in the spring of 1977 shows an arid environment that seems largely devoid of life. Droughts are common in the region and must have been trying times for hunting and gathering peoples, forcing them to scrounge and move elsewhere to find sustenance. There are, however, actually a wide variety of plant and animal species native to the area, but it was probably only in wet conditions and cooler seasons that people spent much time here in prehistoric times.
