<h1>Climatic Trends</h1>
<p>This column depicts four different interpretations (lines) estimating long-term climatic trends over the last 13,500 years in the region. Each line represents a different body of evidence. This compilation is the work of Dr. Dale Hudler, a UT-Austin archeologist who carried out research at Camp Bullis just north of San Antonio on the southeastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. Hudler&rsquo;s study of cave deposits there yielded two lines of evidence, one based on plant pollen and one based on the magnetic properties of cave sediment. The other two interpretive lines were created by other researchers using pollen evidence from bogs just east of the Edwards Plateau and microfauna (bones of small animals) from Halls Cave in Kerr County. In addition to the information provided in the chart legend, there is a great deal more concerning the nature of the evidence and the interpretive process in Hudler's dissertation.</p>
<p><strong>Why show a complicated chart that can&rsquo;t easily be explained?</strong> Two reasons. The first is to emphasize the fact that the Plateaus and Canyonlands region sits astride a major climatic boundary between a vast region of North America  predominately made up of wet and humid areas (the Eastern Woodlands) and one that is predominately dry (the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts of the American Southwest and northern Mexico). All of the interpretive lines suggest that the regional climate has oscillated back and forth between drier and wetter conditions.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the chart just shows projections of long-term climatic trends. All Texans, especially those living in the western half of the state, are familiar with short-term droughts lasting months or years and the less common wet years (like 2004) affected much of the state. While  people mainly react to short-term climatic events and fluctuations, many prehistoric cultural patterns represent long-term changes (adaptations) over many generations. As the climate becomes progressively drier, for instance, some formerly dependable food resources become less numerous<strong>,</strong> and people are forced to either move or learn to depend on what is available. It is also likely that higher human population densities were possible during more favorable climatic periods. Prehistoric peoples sometimes coped with less favorable periods by adopting new strategies for making a living. For instance, a distinct prehistoric pattern is the greater reliance through time on labor-intensive earth-oven baking of marginal plant resources like bulbs and roots, foods that are and were much less desirable than deer, nuts, and fruits.</p>
<p>The second big point is that it is extremely difficult to accurately reconstruct ancient environments in the Plateaus and Canyonlands region. All available lines of evidence are based on measuring &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; variables&#8212;things that are thought to indirectly reflect ancient climates. For instance, extended wet periods favor the growth and expansion of woodlands and an overall higher biomass, while dry periods are marked by lower biomass and the expansion of contrasting vegetation patterns, such as grasslands. By calculating the relative frequencies of different types of plant pollen, which is preserved in only certain kinds of places like protected cave deposits and constantly wet bogs, scientists can see trends through time and make educated guesses about climatic trends. Thus, pollen is an example of a proxy variable that indirectly reflects climatic changes. Interpreting pollen data is very tricky, however, as many factors can affect pollen preservation and distribution.</p>
<p>Summing it all up, we can say with confidence that the climate of the Plateaus and Canyonlands region is marginal, meaning that it characteristically fluctuates between relatively wet and relatively dry periods, some lasting months or years, and longer cycles that span hundreds of years. We don&rsquo;t yet have enough evidence from enough locations across the region to pin down the precise timing and duration of most of the climatic shifts, particularly the shorter-term ones.  But we know the region has a climate that has experienced long periods of predominately dry conditions. During such times, especially when population densities were high, living off the land was tougher and required different strategies than during the wet cycles. A summary of the climatic history of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands appears in the <a href="../../../hinds/climate.html">Paleoclimate section</a> of the Hinds Cave exhibit. </p>
