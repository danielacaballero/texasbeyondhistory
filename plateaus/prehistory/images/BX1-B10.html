  <DIV class=caption>Drawing of a Late Archaic burial covered with nine white tail deer antler racks (attached to deer skull fragments). The antler racks were obviously placed over the body as an offering, suggesting that deer were symbolic links between life and death. The deceased was a young woman estimated to be 16-19 years old who lived about 1900 years ago (ca. 100 A.D.). She was interred in a prehistoric cemetery in the Olmos Basin in  San Antonio; the graves were encountered during dam construction work.
