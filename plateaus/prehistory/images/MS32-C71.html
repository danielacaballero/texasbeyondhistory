<div class="caption"> <em> Earth oven facility dating to the 17 th century (1600s) at the Honey Creek site in southwestern Mason County. On the right is a mostly intact oven bed (notice the larger rocks) and dark baking pit, while the small scattered rocks to the left are interpreted as clean-out debris from earlier cooking episodes. Although a variety of charred plant remains were found in this area, fragments of two likely baking plants were found &ndash; sotol and prickly pear. The absence of any European trade items suggests that this oven was used during the waning years of the prehistoric era. TARL archives. </em> </div>
