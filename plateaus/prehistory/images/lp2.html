<h1>Lower Pecos Canyonlands Prehistory</h1>
      <p> The Lower Pecos Canyonlands began attracting archeological attention
        in the 1930s when word of the wealth of perishable artifacts in the dry
        rockshelters spread among museums and research institutions in Texas
        and the nation. The world-class rock art also began attracting serious
        attention at about the same time, as epitomized by the work of artist Forrest
        Kirkland (see<a href="../../artistic/images/fk.html"> biographical sketch</a>). </p>
	   <p>The Lower Pecos area is generally considered to be a distinct
        archeological region, but its prehistory has much in common with that
        of the adjacent Edwards Plateau and northern Coahuila (Mexico). These similarities have been obscured
        because of different  preservation conditions across the wetter Edwards
        Plateau and because of the general dearth of archeological research in
      Coahuila.</p>
       <p>A good introduction to the Lower Pecos Canyonlands 
        can be found in a separate TBH exhibit (see <a href="../../../pecos/index.html">Lower
          Pecos</a>). Briefly, the area
        is defined by the junctions of the Pecos and Devils Rivers with the Rio
        Grande just upstream from Del Rio, Texas. The three rivers and their
        many tributaries form deeply incised canyons within which numerous rockshelters
        occur. Although the region is arid, averaging less than 15 inches of
        rain per year, the rivers as well as springs and temporary waterholes
        called <em>tinajas</em> within the smaller canyons provided reliable
        water sources.</p> 
	   <p>For over 13,000 years hunter-gatherers lived in the region,
        sometimes occupying the rockshelters. The generally dry conditions coupled
        with the protected rockshelters resulted in the preservation of fragile
        materials such as wooden artifacts, woven sandals, and plant food refuse
        that decay quickly in most other areas of Texas. The spectacular rock
        art that abounds in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands gives researchers insight
        into aspects of human behavior&mdash;ritual, religion, mythology&mdash;that
        are all but impossible to study at most sites across the Edwards Plateau.
