<div class="caption">This rock art panel has several styles of Lower Pecos rock art. Most of the elements including the large shaman figure just to the right of the sign board are of the Pecos River style, which is at least 3,000 years old. But the smaller dark red anthropomorphic figure with down-turned arms just to the right of the shaman element is of the Red Monochrome style, which dates several thousand years later. This 1958 photograph was taken during the early phases of the salvage archeological work done within what is today Amistad Reservoir near Del Rio. The chalk board incorrectly reads VL 18; the correct site number is 41VV18. Photo from ANRA-NPS Archives at TARL.</div>
