<div class="caption"> <em> Prickly Pear cactus was a critical food resource for those who stayed at Hinds Cave. Some 70% of the coprolites contained prickly pear skin and even more contained prickly pear fiber. The combined evidence of the fiber, seeds, and skin suggests that the pads and fruit of prickly pear cactus were a dietary mainstay and eaten almost every day.
