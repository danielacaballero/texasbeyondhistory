  Re-joined Clovis biface, or perform, from Kincaid Shelter. Before they were recognized as pieces of a single Clovis artifact, the sections had been separated in two different institutions since the 1950s: the pointed distal section on display at the Texas Memorial Museum, and the base at TARL. The broad flake scars extending nearly across the face of the biface are characteristic of Clovis technology. The object was broken during manufacturing, according to Collins, after the first flute had been removed. Photo by Aaron Norment, drawing by Pam Headrick.
