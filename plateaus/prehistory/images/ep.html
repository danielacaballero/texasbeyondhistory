<h1>Eastern Plateau Details</h1>
      <p> The eastern Edwards Plateau and the intertwined eastern Balcones Canyonlands
  have been the focus of intense archeological investigation since James E. Pearce
  began excavating sites in the Austin area around 1919. This concentration of effort is due to two related
  factors, ecology/hydrology and modern development.</p>
      <p>Compared to the western Edwards Plateau and the Lower Pecos Canyonlands,
        the eastern Plateau is wetter and far more ecologically favorable for
        human settlement&#8212;a statement that is as true today as in was in prehistory. Prehistoric peoples seem to have been drawn to
        this area since Clovis times because of the natural concentration
        of resources: permanent springs and spring-fed rivers and streams,
        major forested valleys representing westward-stretching fingers of the
        Eastern Woodlands, attendant concentrations of desirable plants and animals,
        high quality flint (chert) for tool-making, and a ready supply of limestone
        cobbles for plant baking. There is plenty of flint and limestone elsewhere
        in the overall region, but the concentration of other natural resources
        is a reflection of climate and hydrology. Compared to farther west, the
        eastern Edwards Plateau is wetter, has a somewhat longer growing season,
        and has much more surface water because of higher rainfall amounts 
        and the discharge patterns of the underground aquifers.</p>
      <p>It is certainly not coincidental that the eastern Edwards Plateau has
        seen the highest concentration of population and development during the
        19th and 20th centuries. Many of the same things that drew prehistoric
        peoples&#8212;permanent water, diverse resources, and valleys with
        deep soils&#8212;drew early Hispanic and Anglo settlers and more and more people
        today. As a direct consequence of the greater modern-era population and
        development, the eastern Plateau has seen far more archeological research
        than any other subarea of the region, especially the sparsely populated
        western Plateau. The fact that the  University
        of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas at San Antonio are located in this region accounts for part of the research focus. But much  of the research has taken place  since the
        1960s  in response to federal
        and state laws. These laws pertain to federal and state funded development,
        federal and state lands, and federal and state development requirements.</p>
      <p>The research concentration on the eastern Edwards Plateau has allowed
        archeologists to learn much about the prehistory of the area and also
        of the relatively recent climatic changes that have occurred since humans
        arrived on the scene some 13,500 years ago. These findings have been
        summarized by several different researchers over  two decades in articles
        published in the <em>Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society</em>, one
        of the leading regional archeological research journals relevant to the
        prehistory of Texas. Below are links to the two most recent summaries of the "central Texas" archeological region. Although this region includes all of the Edwards Plateau as well as strips of adjacent natural regions, especially the Blackland Prairie to the east, the vast majority of the data upon which interpretations are based comes from sites in the eastern Plateau and the  Balcones Canyonlands.</p>
