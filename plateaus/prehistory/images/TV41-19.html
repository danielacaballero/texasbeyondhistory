<div class="caption"> <em> </em> <em> </em> <em> The 1939 excavation of a deep river terrace along the Colorado River under what is today Lake Austin found deeply buried occupation zones separated by flood deposits. Unfortunately, the work at the Rob Roy Ranch Site No. 1 (41TV41) was done long before radiocarbon dating. The archeologists of the day had little experience in excavating deep terrace sites. Based on the recovered artifacts, the intermittent occupations in this stretch of the river valley spanned much of the long Archaic era. It is almost certainly the case that the deepest and earliest zones were never reached. The Colorado River Valley was undoubtedly a highly favored settlement zone throughout prehistoric times.
