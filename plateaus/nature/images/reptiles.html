<h1>Reptiles (many species)</h1>  
      <p> Snakes, lizards, frogs, and turtles were all regular dinner items for
        the prehistoric peoples of the region. Among the reptiles bones recovered
        from Hinds Cave are the following species: spiney soft shell turtle (<em>Trionyx
        spiniferus), </em> Texas spiny lizard (Sce<em>loporus olivaceous), </em> Texas
        horned lizard<em> (Phrynosoma cornutum), </em> Texas alligator lizard
        (<em>Garrhonotus liocephalus), </em>western diamondback<em> (Crotalis
        atrox), </em>mottled rock rattler (<em>Crotalis lepidus), </em> and the
        Rio Grande leopard frog (<em>Rana berlandieri).</em> Many other reptile
        species have been identified at archeological sites elsewhere in the
      region.</p>
      <p> Many reptiles are even easier to capture than rodents, being cold-blooded
        and characteristically slower. Turtles, for instance, spend many days
        out of the water sunning themselves on rocks. At Hinds Cave, lizards
        were sometimes eaten whole: skin, bones, and all. Other small reptiles
        were probably also eaten with minimal preparation. Grab it and gulp.
        Terrestrial and water turtles were also valued for their shells. At Kincaid
        rock shelter in Uvalde County, the plastron (undershell) of a turtle
        was found in early Paleoindian levels. Turtle shells were used as containers
        and as musical instruments. </p>
