<div class="caption">This painted pebble from Centipede Cave in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands bears the original red ocher design as well as pigment that bled from the design after the artifact was deposited in the cave.  This may suggest that the artifact was placed in the cave soon after it was painted. Most painted pebbles, even those found in dry caves, are less intensely colored and look faded. Photo by Monica Trejo; artifact in the ANRA-NPS collections at TARL, specimen #AMIS-25110a.
