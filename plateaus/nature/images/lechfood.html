<h1>Lechuguilla as a Food</h1>  
      <p>   As a food source, lechuguilla was sought out for the carbohydrates
        contained in the central stem and attached lower leaf bases, sometimes
        referred to collectively as the heart. The heart of the plant is rich
        in carbohydrates, but these are very complex, long-chain sugars that
        must be broken down by prolonged heating (baking) before they are edible.
        The baking is also needed to break down the toxic sap. Native peoples
      baked lechuguilla in earth-covered cooking pits known as earth ovens.</p> 
      <p> Although lechuguilla can be harvested and baked any time of the year,
        the maximum amount of sugars are present during wet periods just prior
        to the time a mature plant sends up its flower stalk. The sugars are,
        in effect, stored energy that the plant draws on to flower. During droughts
        the plant is stressed and contains little sugar relative to toxic compounds
        and fiber. After sending up its flower stalk, the plant&rsquo;s energy
        is spent and it usually dies. Because it can take up to 30 years for
        a plant to mature, lechuguilla stands can be easily over harvested, especially
        if smaller, less ideal plants are removed out of desperation or for non-food
        use. Heavily harvested stands may take several decades to recover.</p>
      <p> To harvest the plant, a strong hardwood digging stick or modern equivalent
        must be used to pry up the tenacious plant or sever the central stem
        from the roots. Given its preferred rocky habitat, this requires expertise
        or lots of persistence. Once the plant is removed from the ground, the
        leaves are trimmed off close to the central stalk with a sharp stone
        or metal knife. Only the leaf bases (the part that attach to the stem)
        are potentially edible. Once cooked, the trimmed leaves are eaten somewhat
        like an artichoke leaf, albeit a very tough, chewy artichoke leaf.</p>
      <p> Once trimmed lechuguilla stalks are amassed, they are cooked in a  5-step process
        in an earth oven.</p>
      <p> 1) Prepare abroad, shallow pit with sloping walls (about 20-24 inches
        deep by 5 to 7 feet wide). Loosely stack approximately 450 pounds of
        wood (branches) and place 515 pounds of large rock into the wood. (See
        Oven Sequence 1 and 2)</p>
      <p> 2) Let it burn until only hot coals are left. By now the heat has been
        transferred from the burning wood to the rocks, which act as a <em>heating
        element</em>. (Oven Sequence 3)</p>
      <p> 3) <strong>The exposed rocks are VERY HOT, about 700-900 &deg; F, and VERY
        DANGEROUS. </strong>Place the green packing material, consisting
        of prickly pear pads, on the hot rock heating element; this has to be
        done QUICKLY, or the prickly pear pads will burst into flame. The prickly
        pear pads contain lots of water and oxalic acid. When heated, the pads
        provide steam and a mild acid that helps to break down the toxins in
        the lechuguilla plants. Put the trimmed lechuguilla on the packing material
        (Oven Sequence 4)</p>
      <p> 4) Cover the food with prickly pear pads, leaves or a mat, then cover
        everything with a thick layer of dirt, making certain that the oven is
        completely sealed. (Oven Sequence 5)</p>
      <p> 5) Open the oven after waiting 48 hours, remove the cooked lechuguilla,
        (which now  smells like molasses), chew wads of leaf bases, pound the
        stems into pulp and shape into flat cakes. Dry the cakes in the sun.
        (Oven Sequence 6-8). </p>

      Not shown is the addition of a second layer of prickly pear pads above
      the lechuguilla layer. The plant materials are then covered with a thick
      layer of earth, which seals the oven, creating a steamy, anaerobic environment.
      If the oven is properly constructed, the steam maintains the temperature
      of the lechuguilla at very near 100 C (boiling temperature) for many hours.
