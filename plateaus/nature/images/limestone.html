<h1>Limestone</h1>   
      <p>Among the rocks and minerals found in the Plateaus and Canyonlands, limestone is rivaled only by chert as being the most important natural
        resource to native peoples. Around 9,000 years ago, the prehistoric peoples
        of the region began using heated limestone cobbles  to cook
        food. Hot-rock cooking remained one of the defining aspects
        of the region until early historic times when Europeans arrived and soon
        disrupted almost every aspect of native tradition. The dominance of
        the prehistoric pattern is attested to by the tens of thousands of burned
        rock middens&mdash;mounded accumulations of fire-cracked rock (mainly
        limestone)&mdash;discarded cooking stone fragments. In fact, the region as a whole
        has what may well be the most impressive concentration of hot rock cooking
        debris known anywhere in North America and perhaps even the world. And
      it all began with simple limestone rocks.</p>
	  
	  <p> Limestone makes a good cooking stone because it can be heated to
        400-500 C in a simple wood fire and, once good and hot, it holds heat
        for hours or even days. This property was used to cook food, especially
        within the layered cooking arrangements known as earth ovens.</p>
      <p>Because the Edwards Plateau is a vast expanse of limestone bedrock,
        suitable limestone rocks could be picked up almost anywhere in the region,
        with the exception of the Llano Uplift area where metamorphic rocks such
        as granite predominate. There are also a few areas were the bedrock is
        mainly calcareous sandstone and both of these rock types were used for
        cooking as well. But throughout most of the region, limestone was the
        available and preferred cooking stone. We know this because a number
        of situations have been documented where limestone was consistently chosen
        for cooking even though other types of rock were present in the immediate
        area. </p>
      <p>Not all limestone makes good cooking stone. The best is relatively hard
        (but not too hard, like dolomite), non-porous, and free from cracks.
        Porous and cracked rocks soak up moisture readily and are actually dangerous
        to use for cooking because they often shatter explosively when heated.
        Prehistoric cooks would have quickly learned this and would have chosen
        dry, intact rocks. Stream-rolled (naturally rounded) cobbles were usually
        selected, but these weren&rsquo;t pried out of a wet creek. Most stream
        valleys have lots of high and dry streamed-rolled cobbles and boulders
        in places where ancient streams deposited them tens of thousands of years
        ago. In upland areas, the  surface rocks are often angular chunks or tabular slabs, and these
        forms were used as well.</p>
      <p>Limestone cobbles began their short careers as cooking stones about the size of a loaf of bread.
        Thermal cycles of heating and cooling soon
        take their toll, creating cracks and breaking apart the  intact 
        cobbles into smaller and smaller pieces. Depending on the rock quality
        and the way it was used, limestone cooking rocks could  be reused two
        to four times before they broke down into fist-sized angular fragments known
        to archeologists as FCR (fire-cracked rocks). </p>
      <p>Limestone rocks were also used for other purposes. Some were used as
        relatively soft hammerstones for flintknapping (harder rocks like quartzite
        were usually preferred). Hard limestone rocks were also used for grinding
        stones (manos/handstones as well as grinding slabs), but   harder stones, such as granite and other metamorphic rocks, were preferred. When
        limestone was the only rock available,  that is what they used.
        Among the more interesting uses of limestone are the curious &ldquo;incised&rdquo; stones
        that are occasionally found at Archaic sites across the Edwards Plateau.
        Archeologists have speculated that these are shaft straighteners that
        may have been  heated  and used to help shape and straighten wooden dart
      shafts. </p>

	Stream-rolled limestone cobbles form the hot-rock bed of an experimental earth oven built by archeologists in 1993.  As hot-rock cooks go, these archeologists were rank amateurs.  A good cook would have added the rocks hours earlier while the fire was burning intensely.  In the background, the pile of wet grass and green leaves will be used as “packing materials” to insulate and keep the food clean.  The intended food is visible on the far right—trimmed sotol and yucca hearts.  The mound of earth barely visible on the left will be used to seal the oven.  Two days later, the baked carbohydrate-rich plants were finally edible.   Photo by Steve Black.

	<div class="caption">These curious “incised” limestone rocks from the Panther Springs Creek site in northern Bexar County are thought to be shaft straighteners that were heated slightly and used to help shape and straighten wooden dart shafts.  Never common, these artifacts have been found here and there across the region, although they are easy to miss—in the ground, they look pretty much like a cooking stone.
