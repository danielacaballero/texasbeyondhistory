<div class="caption"> This Gahagan knife made of Georgetown flint was made by a master flintknapper who lived about 1100 years ago.  This artifact may or may not have been created as a functional tool.  It was included as grave offering that accompanied an Early Caddo leader buried in special cemetery at the George C. Davis site in east Texas.  It measures over 7 inches long.  Only the very best of modern flintknappers can create thin bifaces of this quality using traditional methods. TARL archives.
