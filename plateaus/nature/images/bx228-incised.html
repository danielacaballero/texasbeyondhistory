<div class="caption">These curious “incised” limestone rocks from the Panther Springs Creek site in northern Bexar County are thought to be shaft straighteners that were heated slightly and used to help shape and straighten wooden dart shafts.  Never common, these artifacts have been found here and there across the region, although they are easy to miss—in the ground, they look pretty much like a cooking stone.
