<h1>Clay</h1>   
      <p>Clay occurs in a great many places across the Plateaus and Canyonlands
        region and is easily accessible in the banks of rivers, including the
        Colorado, Pedernales, San Saba, as well as smaller streams on the Edwards
        Plateau. The clays found in the region vary considerably in mineralogy,
        color, purity, and texture, and thus some are much better suited to making
        pottery than others. Native peoples used clay in several ways, from pottery
        vessels and pipes to a sealant (daub) for long-term shelters. Compared
        to those in other areas, however, such as the Caddo in the East Texas
        Piney Woods, the prehistoric peoples of this region took up pottery making
        relatively late, in the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period (Toyah
      interval; circa A.D. 1300).</p>    
      <p>Typically, Toyah potters incorporated crushed animal bone (bison, deer),
        and less frequently quartz sand or grog (crushed pottery), as tempering
        agents into the clay and water paste. They then formed the clay into
        various shapes to make ollas (water jugs), jars, bowls, or other containers
        which were then dried and fired. Temper is added to clay to improve its
        workability, drying characteristics, and firing abilities; water is added
        to increase plasticity. The bison- and deer-hunting Toyah people would
        have had quantities of bone available to add to clay. The pottery was
        finished nicely (smoothed and polished) and then fired in open fires
        at relatively low temperatures. The resulting earthenware pottery was
        well made and quite serviceable, but relatively fragile and easily broken
        compared to kiln-made pottery. </p>
      <p>The addition of pottery to the native tool kit must have been significant.
        Although a great deal of aboriginal cooking involved use of small hearths,
        earth ovens, and flat stone griddles, clay pots would have been extremely
        useful for cooking stew-like meals and also for hauling and storing water,
        and storing food stuffs such as seeds and nuts. In bison butchering camps,
        clay cooking pots would have enabled more efficient &ldquo;bone-greasing,&rdquo; the
        process of boiling animal bones to extract the valuable fatty oils. </p>
      <p>Remains of pottery vessels have been found at Toyah interval sites across
        the Plateaus and Canyonlands. Recognized as well-made, bone-tempered,
        thin-walled and typically undecorated, the pottery type has been dubbed &ldquo; Leon
        Plain&rdquo; by archeologists. Usually, a mere handful of sherds are
        recovered, but in some cases, hundreds of sherds have been found in one
        site and vessels can be partially restored. Many sherds that are of apparent
        Leon Plain type were, in fact, decorated with engraved or incised lines.
        Other sherds bore traces of a red slip sometimes called Fugitive Red
        Slip. The red pigment coating is thought to contain the iron mineral,
        hematite, and doesn't preserve well. It was probably to decorate the
        so-called Leon Plain pottery much more often than is realized. Brushed
        sherds with sandy paste have also been found in many Toyah contexts,
        as well as remains of Caddo vessels, either carried in or traded in to
        the region.</p>
      <p>Native peoples also may have used clay to help seal or &ldquo;weatherproof&rdquo; their
        temporary shelters (makeshift houses called huts or wickiups), in what
        is termed &ldquo;wattle and daub&rdquo; construction. Wattle&mdash;sticks,
        branches, or reed stalks&mdash;were woven together to make a frame which
        was then covered with mud or clay &ldquo;daub&rdquo; to seal the many
        cracks. Among historic groups, such as the Apache, the finished structure
        had the appearance of a basket turned upside down.</p>
      <p>Although definitive remains of prehistoric shelters have rarely been
        documented in the region, pieces of clay have been recovered that may
        have been daub. This material typically does not preserve well unless
        the structure was burned. At sites such as Wilson-Leonard in Williamson
        County, archeologists found a few fragments of burned clay or mud bearing
        the imprints of<strong></strong>sticks or reeds and we infer that domestic
        structures were regularly built throughout prehistoric times. </p>
