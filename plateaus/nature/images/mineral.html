<h1>Mineral Pigments</h1>   
      <p>Red ocher and related minerals were highly valued by native peoples
        for creating pigments used for painting faces and cave walls, decorating
        clothing and other items, symbolic offerings (blood red pigment), and
        even tattoos. These iron-rich minerals are not particularly common in
        most of the region, but occur in primary context in various geological
        formations and can be found in secondary context in gravel bars and clay
        banks. The fact that we find bits and traces of ochre in many archeological
        site excavations suggests that places where ocher easily could be found
        must have been regularly visited by native peoples. Prehistoric interest
        in ocher, especially red ocher, is not at all unique to the Plateaus
        and Canyonlands region; the use of mineral pigments is known throughout
      the ancient world.</p> 
      <p>Technically, the suite of minerals pigments used in the region is geochemically
        and mineralogically complex. Red ocher, yellow ocher, hematite, limonite,
        and goethite are among the terms used to characterize these pigments.
        Simply put, most are earthy mineral oxides of iron mixed with varying
        amounts of clay, sand, and water. Some forms are soft and can be transformed
        into useful pigments easily. Others are harder and must be crushed and
        sometimes heated before they can be combined with binding and emulsifying
        liquids including water, fat, and soapy plant compounds. Many rocks bearing
        iron oxides have layers or pockets of purer, more intensely colored minerals
        and these were targeted for removal to create pigments. </p>

    <div class="caption">This painted pebble from Centipede Cave in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands bears the original red ocher design as well as pigment that bled from the design after the artifact was deposited in the cave.  This may suggest that the artifact was placed in the cave soon after it was painted. Most painted pebbles, even those found in dry caves, are less intensely colored and look faded.
