<h1>Bison <em>(Bison bison)</em></h1>  
      <p> This animal, known more commonly as buffalo, was only present in the
        region during certain, widely separated, periods in prehistoric times.
        The Edwards Plateau is on southern periphery of the Southern Plains and
        thus on the southern periphery of bison habitat; most of the time. Bison
        did range across the region prior to 9,000 B.C. and during several widely-separated
        periods thereafter. The best known &ldquo;bison presence&rdquo; is the
        Toyah interval during the final centuries of prehistory (about A.D. 1300-1600)
        and into the 17th-19th centuries. Such periods apparently coincided
        with wetter climatic conditions that favored the expansion of grasslands
        in the region. Such climatic intervals may have coincided with periods
        during which the Central Plains was suffering from drought, thus triggering
        the movement of bison into the regionally greener pastures. The details
      of bison movements into the region are poorly understood.</p>
      <p>What we can say is that bison were absent from most of the region during
        most of the last 10,000 years and were not a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; part
        of prehistoric life. Bison herds probably ranged into the far northwestern
        Edwards Plateau somewhat more commonly, but this area was at the southern
        extent of their normal range. When bison entered the region proper, local
        peoples must have done everything in their power to take advantage of
        the reappearing resource. Hunting patterns, hunting methods, group movements,
        and many other aspects of life would have been altered and it is likely
        that &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; groups from outside the region followed the
        bison herds. So we can think of bison as an intermittent, atypical resource
        in the prehistory of the region. </p>
