<h1>Rabbits</em></h1>  
      <p> These animals may have been second only to deer in their importance
        to prehistoric life in the region. Rabbit bones are commonly found at
        sites throughout the region where animal bones are preserved. At least
        three different species were food resources: the eastern cottontail (<em>Sylvilagus
        floridanus), </em>black-tailed jackrabbit<strong> (</strong><em>Lepus
        californicus)</em> and, to the west, desert cottontail<strong> (</strong><em>S.
        audubonii). </em> The ranges of the two species of cottontail overlap
        and, as its common name implies, the desert cottontail is adapted to
        drier, warmer conditions whereas the eastern cottontail favors somewhat
        wetter conditions such as those found in the eastern Edwards Plateau.
        Shifts in the predominance of one cottontail species over the other in
        the deposits in Halls Cave in Kerr County, are thought to reflect climatic
      shifts between wetter and drier conditions.</p>
      <p> Rabbits were a valuable meat source, but their fur was also an important
        resource. Rabbit-fur robes are known from the dry caves of the Lower
        Pecos Canyonlands and they were probably used throughout the region as
        winter garments. Rabbit bones were cut into short lengths to make beads. </p>
