<h1>Hamilton County Flint</h1>   
      <p> This flint from Hamilton County occurs in massive lag deposits on upland
        plain surfaces near Evant, Texas as well as in the gravels along the
        creeks. Hamilton County flint may originate in the Walnut and Comanche
        Peak geological formations
  &ndash; some of it is distinct from many cherts from the Edwards Limestone.
  There are several variations, three of which are referred to here as Evant
  Gray, Evant Mottled and Hamilton Mottled. All varieties are mostly of medium
  to large cobble size, averaging roughly 15 - 25 centimeters in length. Most
  pieces were fairly flat cobbles of irregular shape, with smaller pieces being
  more rounded.&nbsp;</p>     
      <p>Both Evant varieties are of high quality, although some of the mottled
        material can be improved by heat treating.&nbsp; Evant Gray is similar
        to Georgetown flint in most respects and no doubt was a favored material
        of aboriginal knappers, going back to Clovis times.&nbsp; Evant Mottled
        has a primary matrix of grays and browns, often with considerable mottling
        of several shades.&nbsp; This locale is home to the Evant Cores, a cache
        of three Clovis polyhedral cores made of Evant Gray (Goode and Mallouf,
        1991, <em>Current Research in Pleistocene</em>).&nbsp; At least two other
        Clovis cores are known from the region, and are also made of Evant Gray.&nbsp; Goode
        suspects that it was not just the quality, but also the shape of cobbles
        (rounded and elongate) that made this a favored material for Clovis blade
        making.</p>
      <p>The Hamilton Mottled material ranges from medium/large cobble size up
        to sizeable boulders (50 - 60 centimeters in diameter or larger).&nbsp; Generally
        speaking, this material is of lesser quality, but it can definitely be
        improved by heat-treating.&nbsp; Mottles of various browns and grays
        occur within a primary matrix of light to pale brown and grayish brown.&nbsp; Prehistoric
        tools made of these flints occur in a local collection, which also reveals
        the considerable variety of materials in this region.&nbsp;</p>

Clockwise from the right, these include a large tested cobble (and freshly struck flake), a smaller flat cobble with freshly struck flakes, a probable Clovis blade core and replica Clovis point.  Except for the latter two items, the other materials are the work of archeologist and flintknapper Glenn Goode, who took these photos.</div>
