<div class="caption">This typical upland scene on the western Edwards Plateau has an abundant supply of deadwood for the picking including fallen juniper and standing mesquite.  But keep in mind that native peoples used firewood constantly, especially in the winter when it was used both for cooking and warmth.   For the first few days in any campsite, gathering wood would have been easy, but it would not have taken too long before firewood gathering trips became longer and harder, especially when larger groups of people came together.  This is one of many factors that keep the lifestyle mobile.  TARL archives.
