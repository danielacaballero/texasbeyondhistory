<h1>Pedernales Pink Flint</h1>   
      <p>Pedernales Pink flint is a colorful and high quality material found
        within the Pedernales River drainage basin in Gillespie County.&nbsp; This
        flint occurs within the same Fort Terrett and Segovia geological formations
        that yield Root Beer flint. Like many of the colorful flint varieties
        in Gillespie, Kimble, and Kerr Counties, Pedernales Pink has a fairly
        localized distribution: from the vicinity of Harper, Texas to the vicinity
    of Fredericksburg.</p>     
      <p>In primary context, Pedernales Pink occurs in
        rather thin bands (2-6 cm), seams, or ledges, and is often found on the
        surface as broken slabs and flat cobbles.&nbsp; There
is considerable variety in the color schemes, with some pieces being mostly two
or three shades of light pink.&nbsp; Another variety has pinks, browns, and light
yellows.&nbsp; Some Pedernales pink is also similar to Rootbeer in that the innermost
portion is of poor quality and appears as a band of brown flint that is bordered
by lighter colored layers. And, identical to the reduction technique seen in
certain Rootbeer flint, many Pedernales cores from prehistoric quarries had fakes
removed from only the good outer material.&nbsp; However, these cores are miniatures
compared to the often much larger flat &ldquo;boulders&rdquo; of Root Beer flint.</p>
      <p>The
  quality of Pedernales pink sometimes rivals its exceptional color, being relatively
  glassy and having good flaking properties.&nbsp; However, on the
      whole it is less glassy and brittle than the best materials, and can often
      be improved by heat-treating.</p>
