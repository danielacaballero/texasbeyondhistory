<h1>White-tailed Deer <em>(Odocoileus virginianus)</em></h1>  
      <p> This animal was the most important animal resource throughout prehistoric
  times in the Plateaus and Canyonlands from at least 9,000 B.C. except for relatively
  brief periods when bison herds were present. Otherwise, deer reigned supreme
  as the main big-game animal in the region, as it still does today.. White-tail
  deer were the most important source of meat and valued for their hides, bones,
  antlers, and sinew. </p>

Native peoples hunted this large mammal with as much fervor as modern hunters, based on the quantities of deer bones found in archeological sites. Deer provided not only meat, but hides for clothing and blankets, as well as bones used for making tools.</div>
