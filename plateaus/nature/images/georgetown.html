<h1>Georgetown Flint</h1>   
      <p> Georgetown flint is the name given to an unusually good chert variety
        that occurs along the eastern fringe of the Edwards Plateau.&nbsp;Modern
        flintknappers &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; a massive, newly exposed source
        of this world-class material in the early 1970s &ndash; the Texas Crushed
        Stone Quarry south of Georgetown, Texas. In the crushed limestone business,
        flint was discarded as a nuisance material&mdash;too hard to crush. This
        rejected material proved to be a boon for the budding modern flintknapping
      community and the word was soon out.</p>    
      <p>Prehistoric knappers long ago recognized that Georgetown flint was a
        truly superior material. They must have systematically sought out primary
        natural exposures and combed through downstream gravel bars in the rivers
        and streams along the edge of this area of Balcones Escarpment. Numerous
        artifacts including very large and especially thin bifaces were made
        from this material, some found at sites hundreds of miles from the source.
        For instance, several of the large Gahagan knives that were included
        as Early Caddo grave offerings at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee
        County in east Texas are made of Georgetown. The material is also known
        from Clovis caches dating to 11,000 B.C (or earlier) and in archeological
        contexts dating throughout prehistoric times. </p>
      <p>Georgetown flint is a fairly localized material from the Edwards Limestone
      formation that occurs in primary context in the only in Williamson County
      and probably in southern Bell County.&nbsp; There is, however, a very similar
      material found in limestone quarries in Hays County that knappers regard
      as a &lsquo;close cousin&rsquo; to Georgetown flint.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Georgetown comes in several shades of gray, with four distinct 'flavors'
      present in the TCS quarry.&nbsp; The best of these is a 'steel' gray that is glassy,
translucent, brittle, and rivals any natural siliceous stone in North America
in flaking quality.&nbsp; In this quarry, flint occurs in three forms: 1) as
ledge flint, in seams or bands approx. 4 to 20 centimeters thick, 2) as bands
of discontinuous thin, flat cobbles (4 - 10 centimeters thick&mdash;perfect for
making bifaces), and 3) as rounded nodules up to about 30 centimeters in diameter.
Some Georgetown flint can be improved by heat treating, but the best material
is perfect for knapping just the way it is. </p>

     <div class="caption">This Gahagan knife made of Georgetown flint was made by a master flintknapper who lived about 1100 years ago.  This artifact may or may not have been created as a functional tool.  It was included as grave offering that accompanied an Early Caddo leader buried in special cemetery at the George C. Davis site in east Texas.  It measures over 7 inches long.  Only the very best of modern flintknappers can create thin bifaces of this quality using traditional methods.
