<h1>Clams and Snails</h1>  
    <h2><strong>Freshwater Clams </strong></h2>
    <p>Freshwater clams, known as mussels, of many species were harvested from
        Texas rivers and streams by native peoples. Eaten raw or steamed, mussels
        provided protein in bite-sized morsels. The shells were used in a variety
        of ways, as well. The larger species were used as tools or as containers,
        such as palettes for paint. The beautiful opalescent interior of the
        shells inspired many native artisans to transform them into jewelry,
        such as pendants or disc beads. The shell typically was cut into the
        desired shape, ground on edges, and drilled to create a hole for a cord.
        Pendants frequently were decorated with patterns of incised lines.</p>
      <p>Archeologists have found shells of these bivalves at varying frequencies
        at sites throughout the Plateaus and Canyonlands. At the Wilson-Leonard
        site, native peoples apparently ate mussels throughout the 13,000-year
        history of the site, although never in large quantities. It appears that
        in some areas, such as the Mustang Branch site in Hays County, Late Prehistoric
        peoples gathered clams in small quantities from nearby Onion Creek to
        supplement their diet.</p>
      <p>During early Historic times, Spanish officials hoped to organize a freshwater
        pearl industry on the northwestern Edwards Plateau after Jumano Indian
        leaders informed them of the vast riches in the <em>R&iacute;o de las
        Perlas</em> (River of Pearls)&mdash;the Concho&mdash;and other rivers.
        Although the operation was never initiated, the Concho, meaning shell,
        still is the namesake for the pearly mussels.</p>
       <h2><strong> Snails</strong> </h2>
       <p> Land snails, particularly those of the genus <em>Rabdotus,</em> have
         been found in enormous quantities in archeological sites. Whether these
         creatures were eaten by native peoples or crawled in to feast on camp
         garbage has been debated  for many years. Increasingly,
         however,  archeologists who carefully study the  evidence argue  that  snails were collected
         for food. At the Mustang Branch site in Hays County, researchers found
         that snails recovered in large concentrations from a Late Prehistoric
         (Austin interval) cooking hearth were predominately mature adults&mdash;the
         size that would be collected for food use&mdash;rather than a mixed
         population of varied ages, such as might crawl into the campsite naturally.
         Native peoples could easily have collected snails from the wooded areas
       along Onion Creek. </p>
