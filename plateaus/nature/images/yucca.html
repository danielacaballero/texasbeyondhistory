<h1>  Yucca [<em>Yucca</em> spp.]</h1>  
      <p> Two types of yucca plants grow in the Plateaus and Canyonlands region,
        thick-leaved (or fleshy) yuccas and thin-leaved yuccas. There are
        several species of each type in or near the region. The leaves of all
        of the region&rsquo;s yuccas have strong fibers suitable for weaving
        and other uses, and the stems of most species can be used for soap. Yucca
        flowers and flower stalks are edible. The thick-leaved yuccas have edible
        fruits. Like the agaves, the yuccas store carbohydrates in their stems
        and leaf bases, but we lack convincing evidence that yucca stems were
        baked in earth ovens and eaten in a similar fashion as lechuguilla and
        sotol. Based on current knowledge, yuccas were at least a minor food
        source in the region and an important source of weaving and sewing materials
      as well as soapy compounds. </p>

	<p> There are three species of thin-leaved yuccas growing in the area: Buckley&rsquo;s
	  yucca (<em>Yucca constricta)</em>, narrow-leaf yucca (<em>Yucca reverchonii)</em>,
	  and Thompson&rsquo;s yucca (<em>Yucca thompsonii)</em>. They produce a dry,
    inedible fruit, but the leaves can be used for weaving and the stems for soap.</p>

    <p> Edible yucca fruits come from the fleshy-leaved yuccas. The best documented
      of these is the banana yucca, <em>Yucca baccata</em>. Its distribution
      is centered west of the Edwards Plateau in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts.
      Although banana yucca specimens have been collected from extreme northwestern
      Val Verde County, the most common of the edible yuccas in the study area
      is Torrey yucca, <em>Yucca torreyi</em>. Although to the uninitiated the
      Torrey yucca vaguely resembles the banana yucca, the fruits are about one-half
      the size of the robust banana yucca fruit.</p>
    <p> We don&rsquo;t have any ethnographic accounts of the use of Torrey yucca,
      but there are many references to the use of banana yucca are applicable
      to the Torrey yucca. For example, because so many animals consume the fruit,
      several Native American groups harvested the fruits before they ripened.
      They ripened the fruits by burying them under a mound of earth or soaking
      it in water (Gifford 1932). Often the fruit was heated in a fire before
      soaking it in water. When ripe, the fruit is slow-roasted or cooked in
      a small earth oven; the resulting product is brown and sweet, much like
      molasses or figs. Banana yucca is somewhat sweeter than the Torrey yucca.
      The seeds are stripped from the fruit and the flesh is either eaten immediately,
      or sun-dried, or pounded into a powder that may be stored and mixed into
      other foods. Some groups, like the Gila Pima, boiled the fruit, dried it,
      and pounded into a sweet meal (Russell 1908). Yucca fruit are not only
      sweet, they are, like agaves, a very strong laxative (Palmer 1871).</p>
    <p> Thick and thin-leaved yucca flowers and flower stalks are edible. The
      flower stalks of the narrow-leaf yucca (<em>Yucca reverchonii)</em>, are
      edible raw, but it's best to eat the portion just below the leaf-like bracts,
      because they can be a little spiny. Yucca flowers were eaten, as evidenced
      by the abundant pollen recovered from some coprolites (Williams-Dean 1978).</p>
    <p> Like the agaves, the yuccas store carbohydrates linked to steroids in
      a class of chemicals called saponins. When the central stems or rhizomes
      of some yuccas are pounded and soaked in water, the resultant mix will
      foam. Of all the yuccas growing around Hinds Cave, Torrey yucca provides
      the best source of this natural detergent.</p>
    <p> Torrey yucca leaves contain a long straight fiber that is much finer
      than the Agave lechuguilla fiber, and provided material for baskets, fine
      cordage, and perhaps even the paintbrushes that were used to paint the
      murals on the canyon walls. The entire leaf of the thin-leaved yuccas has
      been used to weave mats in a manner similar to the mats woven with sotol
      leaves. </p>
