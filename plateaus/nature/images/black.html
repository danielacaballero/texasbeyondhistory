<h1>Brushy Creek Black</h1>   
      <p> Brushy Creek Black flint is one of the names used to described a fine
        black flint that occurs mainly along Brushy Creek in the vicinity of
        Round Rock, Texas.&nbsp; This material is even more localized than Georgetown
        flint, and less abundant, so it was never spread far and wide among ancient
        knappers, although it was much coveted.&nbsp; Brushy Creek black is an
        exceptional flint that in some ways possibly exceeds Georgetown in 'flake-ability.'&nbsp; It
        is glassy, slightly translucent, and brittle, but it seems less prone
      to breakage than Georgetown.&nbsp;</p>     
      <p>It occurs in forms similar to Georgetown and is found in similar geological
        contexts in the Edwards Limestone Formation, varying only in color.&nbsp; Flat
        nodule and rounded cobbles are the most common forms, although thin bands
        also occur; thin bands and flat cobbles are sometimes one and the same,
        depending on the exposure.&nbsp; It is exposed in breaks in the terrain
        along hills and streams, and occasionally spread across flat plains resembling
        a lag deposit.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Many prehistoric artifacts made of Brushy Creek Black
          flint black at were found at the Wilson-Leonard archeological site
        near Leander, Texas covering a long time span. Elsewhere it seems to
        have been favored as a material for making corner-tang knives, a fine
        example of which was found at the Allen Creek site in Austin County.</p>
