<h1>Root Beer Flint</h1>   
      <p>Root Beer flint is the name modern flintknappers have given to a variety
        of chert that is distinctive and widespread in central Texas.&nbsp; It
        is perhaps most abundant in Kimble and Kerr Counties, but also occurs
        in several adjacent counties.&nbsp; Similar materials of slightly different
        coloration occur as far east as Comal County and as far north as the
        Callahan Divide (just south of Abilene).&nbsp; As the name implies, classic
        examples of this flint resemble the color of the beverage root beer &ndash; dark
        brown or grayish brown and translucent on thin edges. In fact, there
        is considerable color variation within the general and informal designation,
        Root Beer flint. One notable variant resembles chocolate milk, while
        another has maroon coloration that sometimes includes an unusual shade
        of dark blue.&nbsp; Color variation is often created by 'swirl' patterns
        of different grain textures, although the best pieces are homogenous,
        dark and translucent. <br>
  <br>
Root Beer flint often occurs in lag deposits on mesas, divides, and upland plains;
such deposits were left behind hundreds of thousands of years ago by ancient
rivers and streams.&nbsp; It also occurs frequently as outcrops in primary context
within limestone bedrock formations, and can be found in secondary context in
the gravel beds of many streams of the region such as the Llano River.&nbsp; The
primary context deposits occur in the Segovia and Fort Terrett geological formation &ldquo;members&rdquo; of
Lower Cretaceous limestone.&nbsp; Similar material, such as that found in Comal
County, occur in different Lower Cretaceous limestone formations.&nbsp; </p>    
      <p>Because it was widespread, abundant, and of generally good quality,
        Root Beer flint was an important tool stone for native flintknappers.&nbsp; This
        flint most commonly occurs as thin, flat cobbles or &ldquo;slabs&rdquo; and
        these are often quite large, with pieces from 12 to 18 inches in length
        not at all unusual.&nbsp;&nbsp;The flint typically has a thin white to
        orange colored cortex (outer rind). &nbsp;There are many upland quarry
        sites in the region--places where the flint is concentrated on or just
        under the surface and where native flintknappers returned many times
        to acquire tool stone. Aboriginal knappers had a particular method for
        reducing the large flat cobbles, or slabs found in upland lag deposits.&nbsp; Many
        of the cobbles are between 1.5-4 inches (4-10 centimeters) in thickness,
        and it is common for the innermost portion to be of poor quality.&nbsp; Therefore,
        the knappers would remove only large flakes from the outer veneer of
        superior Root Beer flint and discard the cobble.&nbsp; A few large flakes
        often were removed from both faces of the flat cobbles, leaving bifacial
        cores that usually were not used again.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>At
      its best, Root Beer flint is a homogeneous material of good quality.&nbsp; It
    is glassy and translucent, but has a toughness that makes it less brittle than
    Georgetown flint, for example.&nbsp; One advantage of this quality is that
    Root Beer flint is less prone to breakage during manufacture.&nbsp; Some contemporary
    knappers heat treat Root Beer flint at relatively low temperatures of less
    than 400 degrees F because it won't tolerate the higher temperatures required
    to heat treat many Texas cherts.&nbsp; Regarding this propensity to overheat
    easily, one of the top contemporary Texan knappers, Troy Herndon of Dallas,
    says that &quot;Root Beer will blow up on a hot day!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

     <div class="caption"> Classic example of Root Beer flint.  Aboriginal knappers removed several large thin flakes from this thin, flat cobble, leaving behind a large bifacial core.  They were obviously after the best part – the thin layer of top-quality material sandwiched between the thin cortex (orange-white outer layer) and the inner central mass of mediocre quality flint.  The large thin flakes they took away would have been ideal for making thin bifaces and dart points.  Photo by Glenn Goode.</div><br><br><br><br>
