<h1>Firewood</h1>
      <p>The native peoples of the region used many kinds of wood for firewood, a basic necessity for hunter-gatherer life. Firewood was used daily for cooking and for heating as well in the winter. </p>
      <p>Since wood charcoal is relatively well preserved in many archeological sites, the list of trees and shrubs known to have been used for firewood is long. </p>
      <p>Archeologists pay a lot of attention to wood charcoal because it is a preferred material for radiocarbon sampling, and it can be readily identified. Archeobotanists (archeologist-plant experts) can take a small piece of ancient charcoal, snap it in half, and compare the cell and grain structure to that of modern comparative samples and identify the genus and often the species of the woody plant (tree or shrub). From the great variety of charred wood known from several sites, it seems clear that any dry wood was burned that was small enough to harvest by hand. That said, oak often seems to have been the preferred species, although this may reflect its wide availability as much as choice.</p>
      <p>For example, the Honey Creek site (41MS32) in Mason County yielded numerous samples of charred wood. Archeobotanist Phil Dering identified at least fourteen different trees from these samples. Oak wood (both live oak and red oak) was by far the most numerous type, representing over 50% of the identified fragments. The next most common was persimmon with about 8% followed by hackberry, walnut, juniper, and buckthorne in descending order of frequency. The less common types included willow, pecan, maple, plum, acacia, ash, and elm.</p>
      <p>The characteristics of the charcoal pieces recovered from archeological sites suggest that most firewood consisted of branch and twig-sized pieces that could be found as ordinary deadwood and driftwood. This makes sense, because the native peoples of the region rarely made or used stone axes. Based on cross-cultural studies of hunting and gathering peoples, the task of gathering firewood must have fallen mainly to children as instructed by their mothers, who were in charge of all household activities. We can well imagine the cook&rsquo;s instructions: &ldquo;Go bring me a stack of firewood and try to get as much good oak wood as you can.&rdquo; </p>

	<div class="caption"> This typical upland scene on the western Edwards Plateau has an abundant supply of deadwood for the picking including fallen juniper and standing mesquite.  But keep in mind that native peoples used firewood constantly, especially in the winter when it was used both for cooking and warmth.   For the first few days in any campsite, gathering wood would have been easy, but it would not have taken too long before firewood gathering trips became longer and harder, especially when larger groups of people came together.  This is one of many factors that keep the lifestyle mobile.  TARL archives.</div>
