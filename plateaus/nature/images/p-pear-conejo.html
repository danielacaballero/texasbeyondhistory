<div class="caption">This prickly pear pad from a dry rockshelter was used as a container, perhaps as a canteen.  For this purpose a large mature nopal was chosen, its spines were singed off, and a small opening was made at the small end with a sharp stone tool.  The opening was tied shut with a green strip of some soft wood, perhaps desert willow.  Archeologists found this artifact at Conejo Shelter within what is today Amistad International Reservoir. ANRA-NPS collections at TARL, specimen AMIS 23681.
