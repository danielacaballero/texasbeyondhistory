<h1>Birds (many species)</h1>  
      <p> Birds were valued for both their meat and their feathers as well as
        their eggs. Many species have been found in some archeological deposits.
        Turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo) was likely the most important food bird,
        but several species of quail and dove were eaten as well as song birds
        such as canyon wrens (<em>Catherpes mexicanus). </em> Bird bones, which
        are hollow, were often used in making beads as well as musical instruments
      such as flutes.</p>
      <p>At the Wilson-Leonard site in Williamson County, egg shells from a variety
        of birds were found throughout levels representing some 13,000 years
        of occupation. Although they were too fragmented to identify to particular
        species, measurement of the thickness of the shells could be correlated
        to bird sizes. The results suggested that native peoples ate mostly eggs
        of birds larger than passerines (perchers and songbirds) but smaller
        than those of turkey and geese. Likely, the eggs of hawks, grackles,
        woodpeckers, and ducks were gathered, adding a nutritious supplement
        to the prehistoric diet.</p>
