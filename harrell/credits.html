          <p class="text">The Harrell site exhibit was written by TBH Co-Editors 
            <strong>Susan Dial</strong> and <strong>Steve Black</strong> drawing mainly on information compiled 
            on the site by two legends in Texas archeology&#151;Alex Krieger and 
            Jack Hughes&#151;as well as the original WPA field notes and records 
            compiled by George Fox. <strong>Meg Kemp </strong>developed the exhibit for the web. </p>
            <p class="text">Alex D. Krieger was a research scientist in anthropology 
              at the University of Texas at Austin and later went on to become 
              Professor of Anthropology at the University of Washington in Seattle. 
              A monumental force in synthesizing and shaping interpretations of 
              prehistoric cultures in Texas, he authored numerous publications 
              on sites throughout the state as well as his 1946 seminal work, 
              <em>Cultural Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas</em>, in which 
              he defined both the Antelope Creek and Henrietta foci. Later, with 
              Dee Ann Suhm Story and Edward Jelks, he set forth classifications 
              and typologies for projectile points and pottery, many of which 
              are still sound more than 50 years later. Krieger died at the age 
              of 80 in 1991.</p>
            <p class="text">Jack T. Hughes also was a pioneer in Texas archeology. 
              His love of exploring nature and archeological discovery was formed 
              early on: he became one of the earliest members of the Texas Archeological 
              Society at the age of 8. The son of a highway engineer who was required 
              to travel frequently, he attended 22 schools throughout East Texas 
              before graduating as valedictorian of his class at the age of 15. 
              Graduating summa cum laude from the University of Texas at Austin 
              with a double major in anthropology and geology, he went on to earn 
              his master's degree at UT (focusing on the Harrell site in his thesis) 
              and doctoral degree from Columbia University. Moving to Canyon, 
              Texas, he taught for many years at West Texas State University and 
              served as curator at the Panhandle-Plains Museum. His work in the 
              region earned him the title, Dean of Panhandle Archeology. He died 
              in May, 2001. </p>
