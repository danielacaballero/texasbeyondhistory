                  <p class="text">The junction of the sand-choked Salt Fork, or 
                    main branch of the Brazos River, and its sweet-watered Clear 
                    Fork tributary in southern Young County has been a favored 
                    place to live for at least 5,000 years. The wide curving river 
                    terraces here provide choice spots for camping with ready 
                    access to water, woods, and the myriad plants and animals 
                    inhabiting the river-fringe woods and the surrounding scrubby 
                    grasslands of the rolling plains. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Clear Fork teemed with mussels, fish, and 
                    waterfowl. Pecans and many other trees could be found in the 
                    narrow woodlands lining both rivers along with deer, turkey, 
                    and many other kinds of game. The fertile river floodplain 
                    was suitable for agriculture, while the nearby grasslands 
                    attracted bison and antelope. Limestone caprock along the 
                    flat-topped hills flanking the river valley provided a ready 
                    source of stone for building hearths and cooking ovens. The 
                    river junction is one of many places in Texas where permanent 
                    water and the favorable lay of the land have attracted generation 
                    upon generation of people throughout changing times.</p>
                  <p class="text">For thousands of years the river junction was 
                    just another stopping place on the hunter-gatherer circuit, 
                    a fine place to camp for a few days or weeks at a time. But 
                    around a thousand years ago people began staying longer and 
                    establishing villages, a pattern that intensified after A.D. 
                    1200. The villagers raised corn and other crops along the 
                    fertile floodplains and hunted buffalo. </p>
                  <p class="text"> In the early 1850s a remnant group of Kickapoo 
                    Indians chose this very spot to establish a small village, 
                    just upstream from the Brazos Indian Reservation where the 
                    Caddo, Tonkawa, Kichai, and Waco tribes had their last refuge 
                    in Texas. After the Kickapoo fled to Mexico and the Caddo 
                    and other remnant Indian groups sheltered in the Brazos Reservation 
                    were forcibly moved to Oklahoma Territory in 1859, white settlers 
                    moved in and soon claimed all the choice land parcels along 
                    the Brazos and its many feeder drainages. Ever since, the 
                    Brazos River junction has been home to several generations 
                    of farmers including the Matt D. Harrell family for whom the 
                    site is named. </p>
                  <p class="text">Pioneering archeological excavations at the 
                    Harrell site in 1937-1938 found evidence of prehistoric villages 
                    that had existed there about 500-1000 years ago as well as 
                    traces of a great many earlier Indian camps, some buried by 
                    up to 25 feet of mud and sand. The remains left behind by 
                    the villagers, including bison bone hoes, corn cob fragments, 
                    shell-tempered pottery, and diamond-shaped beveled flint knives, 
                    represent the southernmost example of Plains Villager culture. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Between A.D. 1100-1500 corn-farming and bison-hunting 
                    peoples lived in settled villages along the major river valleys 
                    throughout the Southern Plains including the Texas Panhandle, 
                    southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, 
                    and Kansas. Odd bits of Caddoan and Puebloan type pottery 
                    and shell ornaments and tools made from materials from distant 
                    sources show that the villagers who lived at the Harrell site 
                    were part of an extensive, if informal, network of late prehistoric 
                    groups linked by trade, kinship, languages, and many shared 
                    cultural traditions. </p>
                  <p class="text">The excavators also uncovered a small prehistoric 
                    cemetery with the remains of 32 individuals, some buried together 
                    in mass graves, others individually. The age of the cemetery 
                    is uncertain, but probably dates before or at the outset of 
                    the main period of Plains Villager occupation at the site, 
                    about A.D. 1200-1500. Based on the arrangements of the skeletons 
                    in the mass graves and the finding of arrow points among the 
                    bones, it is clear that the Harrell site was once the scene 
                    of violent events&#151;perhaps raids from competing enemies. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Several of the skulls have faint cut marks which 
                    may indicate scalping, a rare finding in prehistoric human 
                    remains in Texas. Since the Harrell site was excavated, evidence 
                    of violence has been found at dozens of Late Prehistoric sites 
                    across the Southern Plains. Archeologists now believe that 
                    the Late Prehistoric era was a turbulent time during which 
                    the onset of widespread drought conditions coincided with 
                    burgeoning populations and competition for increasingly scarce 
                    resources such as fertile, well-watered farmland. </p>
                  <p class="text">While fascinating and provocative, the mass 
                    graves at the Harrell site seem to represent an unusual period 
                    in the site's long history, a brief violent interval that 
                    punctuated an otherwise peaceful and ordinary record of life 
                    on the upper Brazos. The archeological excavations uncovered 
                    all sorts of evidence of daily life including over 135 cooking 
                    hearths&#151;small circular arrangements of limestone rocks 
                    that had been heated and used to bake roots and other foods. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"> In one area of the site a sizable burned rock 
                    midden was found that represents one of the northernmost examples 
                    of a pattern more common in central and southwestern Texas. 
                    This accumulation of fire-broken limestone and sandstone rocks 
                    is probably a specialized baking locale where basketloads 
                    of roots were once cooked in the layered arrangements of hot 
                    rocks, plants, and dirt known as earth ovens. Much of the 
                    extensive evidence of hearths and baking at the Harrell site 
                    probably predates the Plains Villager era by thousands of 
                    years.</p>
                  <p class="text">Understanding the Harrell site today requires 
                    an appreciation of its archeological history. The 1937-1938 
                    excavations were carried out under the auspices of the WPA 
                    (Works Progress Administration), a Federal make-work program 
                    that put the nation's unemployed back to work during the Great 
                    Depression. At the Harrell site, one minimally trained archeologist, 
                    George Fox, oversaw the work of dozens of unskilled laborers. 
                    The excavations were extensive and very systematically done, 
                    but Fox did not have the training and experience needed to 
                    fully comprehend what he found. And while the excavations 
                    produced many artifacts as well as extensive field notes and 
                    records (more than 6 inches thick), a formal report was never 
                    written.</p>
                  <p class="text"> As soon as the fieldwork was completed, the 
                    team moved on to other sites. By 1941 World War II was underway 
                    and the WPA program soon ended, leaving the analysis and reporting 
                    of the Harrell site and many others unfinished. A young graduate 
                    student from east Texas, Jack T. Hughes, wrote a Master's 
                    thesis on the site in 1942, but he was hampered by the limitations 
                    of the original work and by the state of archeological knowledge. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Recognizing the importance of the Harrell site, 
                    famed archeologist Alex D. Krieger reexamined the site collection 
                    while he was studying the prehistory of northern Texas. The 
                    Harrell site, he thought, lay at a crossroads of sorts between 
                    the more technically advanced moundbuilding cultures of East 
                    Texas and the Puebloan cultures to the southwest. In his landmark 
                    1946 treatise, <em>Culture Complexes and Chronology in Northern 
                    Texas</em>, Krieger defined the Harrell site as the &quot;type 
                    site,&quot; or ideal example, of the <b>Henrietta focus</b>, 
                    an archeological concept he applied to sites in north Texas 
                    that had Plains Villager materials such as the pottery, bison-bone 
                    hoes, and beveled knives. The Harrell site, he believed, was 
                    the southernmost expression of the Plains Village tradition. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">But this was before Willard Libby's discovery 
                    of radiocarbon dating had revolutionized archeology. Krieger 
                    had no real way of determining how old the finds at Harrell 
                    were except by relative dating. While the chronology of the 
                    Puebloan Southwest was comparatively well known because of 
                    tree-ring dating, that of the mound cultures of the Southeastern 
                    United States (including East Texas) was not yet known except 
                    in relative terms. The archeologists of the day had only a 
                    rudimentary understanding for how river terraces form through 
                    time. Krieger assumed that virtually all of what was found 
                    at the Harrell site&#151;hearths, burials, and Plains Villager 
                    debris&#151;was left behind by a single culture at more or 
                    less the same time. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today the Harrell site remains enigmatic. It 
                    is still one of the few intensively excavated sites in the 
                    west-central part of north Texas, but it has never been critically 
                    reevaluated. While some of Krieger's most important ideas 
                    are still accepted, others are now seen as outdated or clearly 
                    wrong. The Plains Village occupations in north Texas between 
                    about A.D. 1200-1500 are still poorly known. Krieger's term, 
                    the Henrietta focus, is still in use, although some believe 
                    the concept is outdated and prefer the term, Henrietta phase 
                    or complex. Today we realize that the archeological evidence 
                    from the Harrell site is much more complex than the archeologists 
                    of the 1930s and 1940s recognized and that some of its cultural 
                    debris accumulated long before the Plains Villager era. Lacking 
                    radiocarbon dates and other kinds of modern scientific evidence 
                    from the Harrell site, we can only make educated guesses about 
                    the site's human history and hope for more research in the 
                    future.</p>
                  <p class="text">Making sense of the past, particularly when 
                    there appear to be influences from several different cultures, 
                    is not an easy task. As Jack Hughes noted in his 1942 thesis, 
                    &quot;reconstructing the history of the part of the Brazos 
                    on which the Harrell site is located is like trying to visualize 
                    a motion picture on the basis of a few still photographs.&quot; 
                    The history of the region, he noted, was complicated by the 
                    arrival of diverse cultures bringing a variety of new traits, 
                    by the assimilating effects of a common environment on all 
                    these cultures, by local cultural developments, and by relationships 
                    spawned through trade. </p>
                  <p class="text">Despite problems of interpretation, the story 
                    of the Harrell site's investigation and of the remarkable 
                    finds made on the banks of the upper Brazos is well worth 
                    telling. In the following sections, we look at the pioneering 
                    excavations and at the evidence uncovered at the site, illustrated 
                    in compelling black and white photographs from the WPA-era 
                    investigations as well as more-recent color photographs of 
                    the artifacts. We also offer a modern perspective on a site 
                    that played an important role in the history of archeological 
                    research.</p>
