                  <p class="text">Violence was clearly afoot in prehistoric Texas 
                    and neighboring regions some 1100 years ago and for centuries 
                    thereafter. We don't fully understand the nature of the conflicts, 
                    the triggering causes, or what carried the hostile impulse 
                    across the southern Plains and far south into central and 
                    coastal Texas. What we do know about this seemingly abrupt 
                    behavioral shift comes chiefly from graves. In small cemeteries 
                    of this time period, archeologists have found widespread evidence 
                    of killing and tell-tale evidence of the instrument of death&#151;arrows 
                    tipped with small stone points&#151;within the graves or even 
                    embedded in the skeletal remains. Some skeletons show more 
                    horrifying signs of violence&#151;crushed skulls, decapitation, 
                    and missing limbs. Taken together, this evidence shows that 
                    during a three- or four-century span between about A.D. 900 
                    and 1200-1300 killing and violence were widespread across 
                    prehistoric Texas, a pattern that is also seen in the Southwest 
                    in the A.D. 1200s and 1300s.</p>
                  <p class="text">While humans have been killing one another throughout 
                    recorded history and probably the entire span of prehistory, 
                    direct evidence of violence is not seen at most Native American 
                    sites in Texas. Aside from burned houses, which may or may 
                    not have been intentionally set afire in anger, the only way 
                    we can spot violence in the archeological record is through 
                    studying human remains. Analyses of human remains found in 
                    other areas of Texas, especially in the central coastal plains, 
                    suggest that violence began to increase during Late Archaic 
                    times about 2000-3000 years ago. While we will never know 
                    what triggered individual episodes, increasing violence is 
                    generally thought to reflect increasing competition for resources 
                    brought about by population increase sometimes coupled with 
                    deteriorating climatic conditions that forced people to intrude 
                    into the territories of others. This is a plausible big-picture 
                    explanation for what happened in the southern Plains in Late 
                    Prehistoric times.</p>
                  <p class="text">One of the most obvious changes that distinguishes 
                    the Late Prehistoric way of life from the longstanding, earlier 
                    Archaic pattern is a change in weaponry systems, from the 
                    ancient spear-throwing device called an atlatl, to the bow 
                    and arrow. Researchers believe this transition occurred gradually, 
                    beginning with the &quot;self&quot; or simple bow (not recurved), 
                    and that hunting peoples may have used both types of weapons 
                    for some period of time. While Plains Indians apparently adopted 
                    the bow and arrow well before the time of Christ, south of 
                    the Red River the transition to the bow and arrow did not 
                    occur until after A.D. 500. By the 1200s a more powerful 
                    type of bow, the recurved bow, began to be used. But other 
                    lifeway changes were probably more fundamental. The introduction 
                    of pottery making allowed people to more easily create containers 
                    and cooking vessels that could be exposed directly to fire, 
                    thus changing (and improving) the way certain foods were prepared. 
                    Even more important was the spread of agriculture, which gradually 
                    allowed (or forced) people to stay in one place for longer 
                    periods. </p>
                  <p class="text">These changes were neither simultaneous nor 
                    uniform across the southern Plains. But as the societies were 
                    transformed from old ways of life to new, violence became 
                    widespread, particularly during the period between about A.D. 
                    900 and 1300. At Southwestern pueblos, there is indication 
                    of all-out warfare or  large-scale killing during the A.D. 
                    1200s and 1300s. Archeologists in New Mexico and Arizona have 
                    studied the ruins of large defensively fortified pueblos that 
                    had been burned to the ground. At pueblo sites such as Techado 
                    Springs in west-central New Mexico, there were piles of unburied 
                    skeletons&#151;many of them young women&#151;apparently laying 
                    as they fell during an attack or massacre hundreds of years 
                    ago. In some Southwest sites, victims had been scalped, and 
                    in others, body parts had been taken, perhaps as war trophies. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Across the southern Plains, the scale of violence 
                    that occured during this time may have been more extreme than 
                    archeologists previously thought. Archeologist Doug Boyd believes 
                    there is ample evidence of devastating raids and attacks, 
                    mutilations, and the taking of body parts as trophies in the 
                    burial data. Although Boyd notes that southern Plains populations 
                    may have been lower than in the Pueblo world, &quot;intertribal 
                    warfare was every bit as important and destructive.&quot;</p>

                  <p class="text">At the Harrell site, the signs of violence were 
                    unmistakable. In the small cemetery overlooking the Brazos

                    lying nearby) were found within three or possibly four mass 
                    graves. According to the very cautious field analyst's description, 
                    arrow points in one of the mass burials were found &quot;in 
                    such positions as to suggest death from wounds.&quot; His 
                    notes continue:</p>
                  <p class="text"><em>The skeleton of B19 had an arrowpoint lying 
                    between the ulna and radius of the right arm and a second 
                    point lay between the ribs. In the section of the backbone, 
                    B-20 had a point protruding from the spinal column; it entered 
                    from the left side, slightly forward of the spine and when 
                    found, protruded from the back at a slight angle downward. 
                    </em> </p>
                  <p class="text">Perhaps the group burials, or mass graves, were 
                    a hasty means of interment of several individuals who had 
                    been killed in a conflict with outsiders. But, in haste or 
                    not, the care shown for the dead is evident in how some of 
                    the graves were arranged. In the largest group interment (shown 
                    in the top photo, burials 19-23), two young men, their bodies 
                    flexed, had been arranged to face a small child who lay between 
                    them (burials 21-23). One of the adults&#8212;his pelvis pierced 
                    by an arrow tip&#8212;appeared to clasp the hand of the child who, 
                    archeologists noted, had a badly crushed skull. Another two 
                    individuals, also victims of arrow wounds, were laid close 
                    together in &quot;spoon fashion,&quot; their knees drawn up 
                    and almost interlocked. Finally, the entire grave had been 
                    covered over with large limestone slabs, grinding slabs, and 
                    smaller rocks. </p>
                  <p class="text">Nearby, a second slab-covered grave (burials 
                    27-29) held the incomplete remains of three individuals who 
                    had been placed in the grave in similarly close fashion. Investigators 
                    discovered an arrow point lying roughly in the area of what 
                    would be the central man's lung or spine area, or possibly 
                    the arm of the adjacent individual. Five other arrow points, 
                    described as long, narrow, and thin (Scallorn type), and a 
                    number of mussel shells, some used as tools, were found among 
                    the skeletal remains of the other two individuals.<br>
                    <br>
                    Another possible mass grave held the remains of perhaps six 
                    individuals, their body parts layered atop one another in 
                    a puzzling arrangement. One individual and a child (represented 
                    primarily by skulls and leg bones) lay in a flexed position 
                    beside another burial (represented by only a skull.) Resting 
                    atop the thigh area of the two flexed skeletons were the leg 
                    bones of another individual, and lying over the shoulder area 
                    were two more sets of legs from yet other individuals. Although 
                    some might speculate that the elements laying on top might 
                    have been intrusive later burials, archeologist Fox noted 
                    the alignments of the higher bones: &quot;Either these bones 
                    were placed with extreme care so as to have them in correct 
                    position, or the limbs were yet in flesh when buried.&quot; 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During excavations in the area (Excavation 3, which also included 
                    the hearth field), investigators uncovered the remains of 
                    32 individuals in all. Although the depths of the graves varied, 
                    they all were within the upper deposits and apparently formed 
                    a series dug in from the same surface, suggesting a burial 
                    ground in continuous use by the same peoples. Few of the graves 
                    intruded into one another&#151;possible evidence that the 
                    cemetery was a designated place and that the grave locations 
                    were marked or well remembered. The tight grouping also suggests 
                    that the graves are roughly contemporaneous and probably occurred 
                    within a few generations.</p>
                  <p class="text">Beyond that, however, the interments varied 
                    radically: while 16 graves contained only one individual, 
                    four bore the multiple interments discussed above. Another 
                    grave&#151;a likely reburial&#151;was compressed into what 
                    is termed a &quot;bundle burial.&quot; It is likely that this 
                    individual died elsewhere and the bones were brought back 
                    to the Harrell site sometime thereafter. Other graves had 
                    stone coverings, a few may even have been placed into a slab-line 
                    enclosure or box-like cist. In one, an older woman (Burial 
                    26) had been placed in an unusual position with legs extended 
                    and upper body bent forward over the legs. The remains were 
                    in poor condition and a number of elements were missing. Against 
                    the top of the skull, excavators found what they termed a 
                    bone awl (likely a hairpin). Although the grave was just southeast 
                    of the mass burials numbered 19-23, it was several inches 
                    higher than the others, and Fox was uncertain whether it was 
                    related to the same burial event. </p>
                  <p class="text">Archeologists studying the human remains at 
                    the cemetery noted that the skeletons, as a group, were poorly 
                    preserved; they could not determine whether this was due to 
                    ordinary decomposition alone. There are several indications 
                    that bodies or skeletons were dismembered or buried in an 
                    already fragmented condition. In five, there was no sign of 
                    the skull; two others contained merely skull fragments; one 
                    had several teeth and a few bone fragments; several others 
                    contained only sections of leg bones. In four, the skulls 
                    had been carefully placed crown down, presumably after they 
                    were no longer connected to the spine. Archeologist Fox wrote 
                    that the inverted skulls were &quot;so definitely in position 
                    that the theory that a settling of the overlapping earth displaced 
                    the skulls is untenable.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text"> How the mandibles, or jawbones, of the dead 
                    were treated at the Harrell site indicated a more ritualized 
                    pattern, clearly not a phenomenon of weathering or nature. 
                    In six graves, jawbones were absent even though the skull 
                    was otherwise well preserved; in several others the jaws had 
                    been removed and placed in the grave separately. In another, 
                    more bizarre instance, the lower mandible appeared to have 
                    been turned around and set in place inside the skull. </p>
                  <p class="text">Displacement and removal of mandibles in burials, 
                    whether a ritual among the aggressors or the families of the 
                    aggrieved, has been fairly widely documented in other cemetery 
                    sites across the region. Based on absence of mandibles in 
                    graves from the Abilene area and farther west, early avocational 
                    archeologist Cyrus Ray speculated that the jaws might have 
                    been &quot;war trophies.&quot; There is evidence for this 
                    type of practice in the East Texas area as well. </p>
                  <p class="text">Enigmatic cut marks on several of the Harrell 
                    skulls have raised the possibility that the individuals may 
                    have been scalped. Both Drs. Michael Collins and Darrell Creel, 
                    who briefly examined the specimens under less than ideal light, 
                    found the marks possibly to be suggestive of scalping but 
                    altogether inconclusive. A more-thorough examination is needed 
                    to fully understand and interpret the condition of the skeletal 
                    remains from the site. </p>
                  <h3 class="text">Funerary Objects</h3>
                  <p class="text">Throughout the cemetery, there were only scant 
                    signs of what archeologists term &quot;offerings&quot; or 
                    funerary objects, the special items sometimes placed with 
                    the dead. Even then, the investigators could not be sure whether 
                    the items had been worn by the individual, were embedded in 
                    the body, or were laid into the grave with the body. As lead 
                    investigator Fox describes their placement:</p>
                  <p class="text"><em>The grave offerings were very few; but with 
                    three exceptions, doubt is entertained as to their being purposely 
                    interred with the body. Within one grave, a bone awl stood 
                    against a skull. In another, a small scraper lay beneath the 
                    pelvic bone. In a third, two points, well made, were close 
                    to an arm bone, in such a position as to indicate the two 
                    arrows buried with the dead. </em></p>
                  <p class="text">And further: <br>
                    <em>A bone bead was beneath the central portion of one grave 
                    with two mussel shells, nested, not far away&#133; In another 
                    grave, about 12 inches from the bones, a mussel shell was 
                    erect in the clay, standing on its pointed end. In yet another, 
                    the mussel shell was set on edge&#133;.</em></p>
                  <p class="text">
                    At the north end of the cemetery, Fox recorded a number of 
                    possible post-hole stains in the area of several graves with 
                    very incomplete skeletal remains. The stains were in groups 
                    or clusters; several appeared aligned in rough arcs. Although 
                    neither Hughes nor Krieger addressed these features, it is 
                    possible they may represent the supports for some sort of 
                    mortuary structures or part of a larger building.</p>
                  <p class="text">Aside from their obvious human interest, the 
                    Harrell site graves are significant from a larger perspective. 
                    In north Texas and further west across the southern Plains, 
                    a number of sites bearing similarities to the Harrell cemetery 
                    have been reported. Most of the graves seemed to be Late Prehistoric; 
                    individuals usually were placed in the grave in a flexed position 
                    and covered with stone. As at the Harrell site, some were 
                    multiple graves in a single large grave, and some lacked mandibles 
                    and other body parts. In rare cases, objects or grave &quot;goods&quot; 
                    were added. Because of these similarities, we suspect that 
                    the Harrell cemetery dates to roughly A.D. 1000-1300 in the 
                    transitional period between the early part of the Late Prehistoric 
                    period and the Plains Villager era which was the Harrell site's 
                    heyday. </p>

                          refuse pit. Burial 32 consisted of little more than 
                          an inverted skull, a displaced jaw bone, and leg bones 
                          lying in the midst of shell and animal bones, a stone 
                          slab, and what were recorded as dark spots in the soil. 
                          One of the human leg bones was described in the records 
                          as gnawed, suggesting the body had been left unburied 
                          for some period of time&#151;long enough for rodents 
                          to disturb. Adapted from Fox, 1938; TARL Archives. </div>
