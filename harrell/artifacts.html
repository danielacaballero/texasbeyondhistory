                    What can these bits of household debris tell us about the 
                    people who lived along the Brazos River and what their lives 
                    were like? </p>
                  <p class="text">A first consideration for researchers analyzing 
                    site remains is identifying where each item came from in the 
                    site deposits in order to understand its placement in time. 
                    Like many prehistoric sites, the Harrell site does not represent 
                    a single episode of occupation by one group of people. Rather, 
                    the types of artifacts, ranging from roughly 5000-year-old 
                    spear points to 600-year-old arrow points, tell us that the 
                    site had a rather long history, as is discussed in the section,<b> 
                    Harrell Site Reconsidered</b>. The challenge for archeologists 
                    studying the Harrell site is to determine which artifacts 
                    date to the same time period and represent the same period 
                    of site occupation. Because of the nature of the site itself 
                    as well as the way it was excavated and documented, the task 
                    of sorting things out into meaningful groupings is no easier 
                    today than it was 70 years ago when archeology student Jack 
                    Hughes began looking at the collections.</p>
                  <p class="text">Here we will simplify the matter and concentrate 
                    mainly on the materials that date from the Plains Villager 
                    period at the Harrell site, roughly A.D. 1200-1500. This period 
                    accounts for the bulk of the artifacts from the site and it 
                    is this period for which the site is best known. Artifacts 
                    known or suspected to date to earlier periods are identified 
                    as such.</p>
                  <h3>Farming Tools </h3>
                  <p class="text">Farming implements were made from a variety 
                    of materials close at hand, including bone and antler from 
                    both deer and bison and shell from freshwater mussel. Plains 
                    Villager farmers commonly used hoes made of bison scapulae 
                    (shoulder blades) that were trimmed and cut to make a flat 
                    triangular blade, which was attached to a wooded handle. Fourteen 
                    fragments of bison scapula hoes were found at the Harrell 
                    site (representing at least four or five whole tools). Another 
                    hoe was fashioned from a section cut from a bison skull near 
                    the horn core. Bone hoes may not have been common because 
                    of the ready availability of large thick mussel shells, some 
                    33 of which were found that show signs of heavy wear and battering 
                    along their edges. These large shells may have been used as 
                    digging tools or hoes to cultivate corn and perhaps other 
                    crops (corn cobs were the only domesticated plant remains 
                    recognized at the site).</p>

                    holes found in many shells were where a stick was inserted

                    animal hides. Also called snubnosed end scrapers, the scrapers 
                    were chipped unifacially (on one side) on a stone flake and 
                    beveled on the wide end. They are commonly found in Late Prehistoric

                  <p class="text">Most of the 81 dart or spear points found at 
                    the Harrell site date to the Archaic period before the bow 
                    and arrow was in use. Dart points were affixed to wooden darts 
                    or small spears thrown with the use of an atlatl or spear 
                    thrower. Their presence tells us that the site was used by 
                    hunters at least as early as 5000 years ago, the approximate 
                    age of the beveled-stem Nolan points. Later Archaic styles 
                    found at the site include the broad-bladed Castroville, Marcos, 
                    and Marshall types, all dating to the Late Archaic about 2000-3000 
                    years ago, as well as smaller and later types such as Darl, 
                    Ensor, and Fairland points, all dating to the very end of 
                    the Archaic, about 1200-2000 years ago. Some of the smaller 
                    dart points may have still been in use when the bow and arrow 
                    was introduced. </p>
                  <p class="text">Arrow points were much more numerous; over 550 
                    of them were recovered from the Harrell site. Most of these 
                    are triangular points that have side and/or basal notches 
                    including the Harrell style, named after the site, and the 
                    Washita point. Scallorn points, the kind found with the burials, 
                    are much less common; only about 25 were found. There are 
                    also various other stemmed points including Bonham and a few 
                    Perdiz as well as unstemmed and unnotched triangular points 
                    and preforms. </p>

                  <div class="caption">Long bifaces or knives, some beveled on 
                    edges, were likely used in cutting meat, plant foods, or in

                  <p class="text">A typical tool found at Plains Village sites 
                    and other Late Prehistoric sites with evidence for bison hunting 
                    is the beveled knife. These stone tools were probably favored 
                    for their durability and longevity. Beginning as long oval-shaped 
                    thin bifaces, their edges were resharpened repeatedly through 
                    &quot;microflaking&quot; or edge-beveling and reused in successive 
                    butchering tasks. As a knife was reused and resharpened over 
                    its &quot;lifetime,&quot; it became progressively narrower 
                    with steeply angled, or beveled edges. Particularly distinctive 
                    are narrow diamond-shaped or 4-beveled knives. While beveled 
                    knives were used over a wide region, the diamond beveled knives 
                    are particularly common in Plains Village sites. Several of 
                    those from the Harrell site are made from Alibates flint (banded 
                    dolomite, technically) that outcrops near Amarillo, some 250 
                    miles to the northeast of the Harrell site.</p>
					
                  <h3>Tools to Make Tools</h3>
                  <p class="text">Prehistoric toolmakers used a variety of tools 
                    and resources in their work. Knappers would have employed 
                    bone and antler batons and hammers as well as small rounded 
                    hammerstones in the first stages of removing flakes from larger 
                    pieces of chert (flint) or other stone suitable for flaking. 
                    Flakes removed in this fashion were then chipped further and 
                    finished using more intricate tools, such as antler tines. 
                    Grooved sandstone tablets may also have been used in tool 
                    making and maintenance, for dulling surfaces or for straightening 
                    heated wooden shafts for arrows. For other tasks, chipped 
                    stone burins or gravers may have been used both for cutting 
                    and grooving bones and for ornamental incising.</p>

                  <div class="caption">These flintknapping tools made of antler 
                    and bone were used to make stone tools. The larger specimens 
                    likely served as &quot;billets&quot; or soft hammers for striking 
                    flakes off pieces of stone, such as flint or chert, whereas 
                    the three pointed antler tools on right are flaking tools 
                    used to remove small flakes from nearly completed chipped 
                    stone tools. </div>
                      
                  <h3>Food Processing, Cooking, and Storage</h3>
                  <p class="text">Amid the quantities of burned rock and other 
                    hearth debris were quantities of grinding stone fragments 
                    and pottery sherds&#151;all that remained of the food processors, 
                    cooking pots, and &quot;Tupperware&quot; of prehistoric times. 
                    Milling and grinding implements, such as manos and metates, 
                    were important processing tools for farming peoples who grew 
                    corn. It is likely that&#151;along with corn kernels&#151;grass 
                    seeds, mesquite beans, and nuts also were ground into flour 
                    for making bread. </p>
                  <p class="text">Of the handheld manos, some were made of hard 
                    sandstone, others of quartzite or a hard, sandy limestone. 
                    Most of the nearly 160 manos had been pecked or worked into 
                    an oval shape, and showed signs of heavy wear. Two manos with 
                    traces of red pigment may have been used for grinding hematite 
                    or ocher for paint. The grinding slabs, often known as metates, 
                    chiefly were made of hard sandstone; only 10 whole ones were 
                    found among the 81 metate specimens. Grinding slab fragments 
                    were often reused as cooking stones, or griddles; many of 
                    these were found among the hearth stones.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although a great deal of cooking involved use 
                    of small hearths, ovens, and flat stone griddles, simple clay 
                    pots were used for cooking stew-like meals and also for hauling 
                    and storing water. To make the vessels, potters used crushed 
                    mussel shell as a tempering agent and formed long coils of 
                    clay into globular jars and deep bowls. The globular jars, 
                    which had rounded bases, likely were cooking vessels. </p>
                  <p class="text">Among the roughly 600 potsherds recovered at 
                    the site, none could be refitted into whole vessels. Based 
                    on similarities and differences, at least 25-30 separate vessels 
                    are represented, according to a recent reexamination of the 
                    collection by archeologist Michael Brack. Judging from the 
                    sherds, most of the vessels were round-bottomed jars with 
                    restricted necks, many of which flared out at the rims. The 
                    openings of these jars were small&#151;averaging 6 inches 
                    (15 cm). A few bowls (at least 4) are also in the collection. 
                    The vast majority of the site's potsherds (98%) are shell-tempered 
                    plainwares, a few with simple decorations. Among the decorated 
                    pieces, most had rows of appliqu&eacute;d nodes; others had 
                    vertical fingernail marks, incised diagonal lines, and stamped 
                    impressions on the vessel body. </p>
                  <p class="text">Krieger defined this type of pottery&#151;shell-tempered, 
                    coiled, globular-shaped, plain to only minimally decorated&#151;from 
                    the north central Texas area as Nocona Plain on the basis 
                    of the Harrell site collection. The pottery was one of the 
                    main &quot;traits&quot; or characteristics of the Henrietta 
                    focus. Freshly crushed mussel shell was added as temper in 
                    almost all the pottery from the site. Brack's study of shell-tempered 
                    pottery from north Texas and Oklahoma found that the Harrell 
                    site's pottery is the most technologically varied of any assemblage, 
                    but closely resembles pottery found at sites along the Red 
                    River and the Washita and Canadian River drainages in southern 
                    and western Oklahoma. The variety of pottery and relatively 
                    large number of vessels suggests that much of the pottery 
                    found at Harrell was locally made.</p>
                  <p class="text">A handful of very interesting and peculiar thick 
                    pottery sherds up to an inch thick were unlike the other shell-tempered 
                    pieces at the site. These appear to be fragments of small 
                    &quot;paint pots&quot;-tall, narrow cylinders with 2-to 3-inch 
                    (5-7 cm) openings. Two sherds have textured or roughened exteriors; 
                    one with diagonal lines and the other with irregular but closely 
                    spaced fingernail punctures or textile impressions, perhaps 
                    to provide a better hand hold on the vessels. Interiors are 
                    bright red, possibly from holding paint made of ochre. Similar 
                    pottery has been found at other post A.D. 1200 sites in upper

                  <h3>Food Remains</h3>
                  <p class="text">Based on charred and fragmentary remains left 
                    behind in the cooking pits and midden rubble, the people of 
                    the north-central Brazos ate a varied diet including buffalo, 
                    deer, birds (turkey and small birds), turtle, freshwater drum 
                    and other fish, and a quantity of freshwater mussels. Meat 
                    would have been dried for use as jerky or pemmican, and bones 
                    boiled or &quot;greased,&quot; to extract fat. The later dwellers 
                    also grew corn, as attested to by the fragments of charred 
                    corn cobs preserved at the site, and collected pecans and 
                    wild plums. Although few other food remains were recovered, 
                    this is mainly because the archeologists did not realize the 
                    importance of collecting charcoal and soil samples from hearths 
                    and of using fine screening techniques to recover the bones 
                    of small creatures. Based on what is known from other sites 
                    in the region, we can guess that they also hunted a variety 
                    of small mammals, collected the beans and acorns of the abundant 
                    mesquite and oak trees in the area, and gathered a variety 
                    of other plants, grasses, and seeds. Cactus, abundant today 
                    in the area, may have been exploited for a variety of uses 
                    as well.</p>
                  <p class="text"> In addition to the &quot;tropical&quot; domesticates&quot; 
                    such as corn, they probably raised other crops such as beans 
                    and squash. Drass's study of earlier Washita River sites suggests 
                    that domestication of plants on the southern Plains may have 
                    started much earlier, with eastern Woodland domesticates such 
                    as sun flower, marsh elder, and chenopodium.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div class="caption">An intricately incised bird bone with cross 
                    hatched designs may have been used as an ornament or in a 
                    special ritual. </div>
                  <p class="text">Among the quantities of tools, debris, and more 
                    mundane objects of daily life were a small number of items 
                    bespeaking a desire to bring beauty and ceremony into the 
                    lives of the people living along the Brazos. There were also 
                    objects that indicated contact with groups in regions far 
                    afield. Based on the array of &quot;jewelry&quot; found at 
                    the site, at least some members of the group wore body ornaments, 
                    including beads made of bone, fossil crinoids, and Olivella 
                    shell, the latter from the Gulf of California over 700 miles 
                    to the southwest. Cut and perforated mussel shells were probably 
                    worn as pendants. Certain other mussel shell sections appeared 
                    to be pendants or tools in the making&#151;unfinished &quot;blanks&quot; 
                    or oval discs cut from flat sections of larger shells. </p>
                  <p class="text">Certain items may have been used in ceremonies 
                    including elbow pipes for smoking native tobacco, tubes or 
                    beads of bird bone, and rasps. The smoking pipes were made 
                    of hard, fine-grained sandstone, and several were decorated 
                    with lines incised around the pipe bowl rim, or with nicks 
                    cut at intervals around the rim. This latter specimen also 
                    has a hole drilled from the outside near the junction of stem 
                    and bowl; archeologist Jack Hughes likened this specimen to 
                    modern &quot;carburetor&quot; pipes. One interesting specimen 
                    clearly saw much use, as indicated by a highly blackened bowl 
                    interior.</p>
                  <p class="text">Several distinctive sherds of pottery found 
                    at the site were almost certainly brought or traded in from 
                    other areas: one of southeastern New Mexico Brownware, and 
                    one engraved sherd from the East Texas Caddo area.</p>
                  <p class="text">That there was interaction or trade with people 
                    from areas far afield is suggested in several items left at 
                    the site including tools made from Alibates flint from the 
                    Texas Panhandle, a biface made of black obsidian from the 
                    Rocky Mountains to the west or northwest, Olivella shell from 
                    the Gulf of California, and sherds of pottery unlike that 
                    made at the site. One orange-colored polished sherd with an 
                    incised design appears to be Poynor Engraved, a pottery type 
                    made by Late Prehistoric groups along the upper Neches in 
                    the East Texas Caddo area. Another is a Brownware sherd from 
                    southeastern New Mexico. These probably represent trade wares 
                    and suggest that the Harrell site was part of a larger trade 
                    network. Both Southwestern and Caddo peoples were known to 
                    be prodigious traders at various times in their history. </p>
