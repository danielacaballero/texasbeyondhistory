                  <p class="text">From the present vantage point we can see that 
                    the archeologists of the 1940s misunderstood several key aspects 
                    of the Harrell site. The critical problem is that they did 
                    not have any way to accurately gauge the age of the deposits. 
                    Radiocarbon dating was not developed as a research tool until 
                    the 1950s. And only in the last few decades have modern geological 
                    methods been applied routinely in archeological investigations. 
                    Without these two critical research tools, it is hardly surprising 
                    that the Harrell site was seen by archeologist Alex Krieger 
                    as representing a single culture which he called the Henrietta 
                    Focus.</p>
                  <p class="text">Alex Krieger was trying to make sense of extremely 
                    broad cultural patterns and link the chronology or time line 
                    of the poorly dated moundbuilding cultures of the southeastern 
                    United States with that of the tree-ring-dated Puebloan cultures 
                    of the southwest. He used the Harrell site and the Henrietta 
                    focus to do just that by arguing that the Plains Villagers 
                    of north Texas were contemporaneous with late Puebloan peoples 
                    and late Caddoan groups. In a general sense, this view has 
                    been borne out by a great deal of research over the last 65 
                    years. But modern researchers have also learned many things 
                    that enable us to reevaluate the dating of the Harrell site. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Krieger argued that the Henrietta Focus dated 
                    to A.D. 1450-1650 based on the relative dates of several Southwestern 
                    pottery sherds and at least one Caddo sherd that were found 
                    at the Harrell site. From the fact that the site's distinctive 
                    shell-tempered pottery (which he named Nocona Plain) was found 
                    in both the midden and in the underlying red clay, Krieger 
                    concluded that the entire 8- to 10-foot thick artifact-bearing 
                    deposit in Excavation 3 could have formed in as little as 
                    two hundred years, mainly as the result of the periodic addition 
                    of flood deposits. He, like Jack Hughes, recognized that certain 
                    of the dart points were more characteristic of central Texas, 
                    where they were regarded as comparatively early artifact styles 
                    that dated to the Archaic period before the introduction of 
                    the bow and arrow. But Krieger assumed that the presence of 
                    these styles at Harrell along with arrow points and pottery 
                    in the same deposit meant that these dart point styles continued 
                    to be used by latter peoples. In contrast, Hughes correctly 
                    reasoned that earlier central-Texas-related peoples had lived 
                    at the Harrell site before the later Plains-related peoples 
                    who used the bow and arrow and made pottery. Hughes' views 
                    were stated cautiously in his unpublished Master's thesis 
                    and were soon overshadowed by Krieger's grand synthesis.</p>
                  <p class="text">Today we have a much better understanding of 
                    chronology. The earliest distinctive artifacts found at the 
                    Harrell site are the beveled-stem Nolan dart points now known 
                    to date to the Middle Archaic period about 4500-5000 years 
                    ago (2500-3000 B.C.). Also found among the Harrell site's 
                    artifacts are examples of Pedernales, Bulverde, Castroville, 
                    Marcos, Ensor, Fairland and Darl dart points (among others), 
                    indicating that the site was occupied intermittently during 
                    much of the Late Archaic, roughly 1200 to 4500 years ago (2500 
                    B.C. to A.D. 800).</p>
                  <p class="text">Nonetheless, most of the artifacts at the Harrell 
                    site do date to the Late Prehistoric era, between about A.D. 
                    800 and A.D. 1500. According to Hughes, some 555 arrow points 
                    were recovered from the site compared to only 81 dart points. 
                    All of the almost 600 pottery sherds also date to the Late 
                    Prehistoric, probably after A.D. 1200. In other words, the 
                    site's major occupation period was after A.D. 800. </p>
                  <p class="text">From the present perspective, we guess that 
                    the third or high terrace where most of the Harrell site excavations 
                    were carried out probably existed as a more or less stable 
                    landform by about 5000 years ago (roughly 3000 B.C.). We further 
                    surmise that during the subsequent 4500 years (from about 
                    3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500) a maximum of five feet of sediment 
                    accumulated on the terrace top. As Hughes realized, by far 
                    the bulk of all the artifacts occurred in the upper five feet 
                    in the dark midden soil as well as all 135 hearths and all 
                    32 graves. The only things found deeper were relatively small 
                    quantities of scattered artifacts, some of which were found 
                    within the apparent pits that intruded into the underlying 
                    red clay. Whereas Krieger assumed that river floods continued 
                    to add sediment to the upper terrace while it was occupied, 
                    we doubt this was the case to any significant degree during 
                    the Late Prehistoric era. The midden layer is clearly what 
                    archeologists today call an anthrosol (literally &quot;man-soil&quot;). 
                    That is to say that the refuse, artifacts, hearth rocks and 
                    so on that people hauled to and left on the Harrell site were 
                    mixed in with the existing soil resulting in a distinct cultural 
                    layer. </p>
                  <p class="text">We suspect that the Middle and Late Archaic 
                    materials were buried fairly quickly and may have been neatly 
                    stratified in a &quot;layer-cake&quot; fashion. However, after 
                    A.D. 800 or so, the site was used more intensively by a series 
                    of Late Prehistoric peoples, including the Plains Villagers 
                    who were responsible for the bulk of the debris and midden 
                    accumulation. There is obvious evidence that the Late Prehistoric 
                    occupants were habitually digging holes&#151;pits for hearths, 
                    graves, and probably for houses and storage. These actions 
                    intruded into and greatly disturbed the earlier (Archaic) 
                    layers.</p>
                  <p class="text"> While no obvious evidence of houses or structures 
                    was recognized, there were several tantalizing clues. Excavators 
                    noticed two odd features in the southeast section of the excavation 
                    block, in the area of Burial 31. One was an area of fire-burned 
                    red clay with impressions of grass and twig marks. Fox noted 
                    that it &quot;appears a fireplace but looks like wattle work.&quot; 
                    In the unit just north, he recorded an oval of cemented white 
                    ashes with two cut depressions in the interior. Whether these 
                    features pertained to a house (with wattle and twigs) with 
                    an interior hearth is unknown; no further mention of the features 
                    was made in subsequent analyses. At the north end of the cemetery, 
                    Fox also recorded a number of possible post-hole stains in 
                    the area of several graves holding very incomplete skeletal 
                    remains. The stains were in groups or clusters, and several 
                    appeared to align in rough arcs. These may represent the supports 
                    for some sort of arbor-like mortuary structures similar to 
                    those recognized at Zimms Complex sites in northwestern Oklahoma.</p>
                  <p class="text">Nonetheless, houses and other types of structures 
                    were almost certainly built at the Harrell site and probably 
                    placed in shallow pits like those that have been documented 
                    at many other Plains Villager sites. All this digging and 
                    earth moving coupled with the continuous burrowing of rodents 
                    (of which much evidence was seen) resulted in the site deposits 
                    becoming badly mixed through time. While the overall trends 
                    are clear&#151;most of the dart points were more deeply buried 
                    than most of the potsherds&#151;the mixing makes it impossible 
                    to neatly sort out the site into separate time periods. The 
                    only things at the Harrell site that we can confidently date 
                    are those that have been dated elsewhere.</p>
                  <h3></h3>
                  <h3>Age of the Cemetery</h3>
                  <p class="text">Before attempting a trial reconstruction of 
                    the human history of the Harrell site, we must raise a thorny 
                    dating problem that cannot be satisfactorily resolved without 
                    further research. That is the age of the cemetery. Krieger 
                    and Hughes both assumed that the graves dated to the latest 
                    and main period of site occupation. In broad terms this is 
                    undoubtedly true: the graves are Late Prehistoric in age. 
                    But today we recognize that the Late Prehistoric era spans 
                    at least 700-800 years and probably 1,000 or more. The bow 
                    and arrow may have been introduced into the southern and central 
                    Plains before the time of Christ followed by the introduction 
                    of cord-marked pottery during the first centuries A.D. These 
                    technologies are the hallmarks of the Late Prehistoric era.</p>
                  <p class="text">The early part of the Late Prehistoric (sometimes 
                    called Late Prehistoric I), from perhaps A.D. 500 or so to 
                    A.D. 1100-1300 is seen by most experts as a time of change 
                    during which the hunting and gathering traditions that characterize 
                    the long archaic era were gradually altered by the introduction 
                    of a new weapon system (the bow and arrow), new storage and 
                    cooking technology (pottery), and, even more importantly, 
                    agriculture and semi-sedentary life. Some areas, such as most 
                    of the Edwards Plateau in central Texas, continued to be occupied 
                    by purely hunting and gathering cultures at the same time 
                    that more-settled village life was becoming prevalent elsewhere.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the later part of the Late Prehistoric (sometimes 
                    called Late Prehistoric II), after A.D. 1200-1250, settled 
                    villagers lived along virtually all of the river valleys of 
                    the southern Plains. Most sites show evidence of corn farming 
                    along with heavy reliance on buffalo hunting, a mixed economy 
                    that sustained village life. This broad cultural tradition 
                    is known as the Plains Villager horizon and it has been subdivided 
                    into dozens of named phases, complexes, and foci reflecting 
                    different local variations and changes through time over the 
                    A.D. 1200-1500 span of the era. Most, but certainly not all, 
                    of what Krieger included within his Henrietta focus dates 
                    to this period.</p>
                  <p class="text">Stepping back in time, we see the transition 
                    between Late Prehistoric I and Late Prehistoric II (the Plains 
                    Villager era) was a time of upheaval and extreme violence. 
                    Skeletons riddled with arrow points, mass graves, trophy skulls, 
                    and mutilated skeletons have now been documented at dozens 
                    of sites ranging from the Texas Panhandle across north Texas 
                    and western Oklahoma to central and southern Oklahoma and 
                    southward well into central Texas. Broadly, most of these 
                    sites seem to date to between A.D. 1000-1300 within the latter 
                    part of what is generally considered to be Late Prehistoric 
                    I. One of the most common arrow point types implicated in 
                    this period of violence is the Scallorn type, which is also 
                    the only arrow point type found with the graves at the Harrell 
                    site. </p>
                  <p class="text">The graves at the Harrell site also share several 
                    other traits in common with Late Prehistoric I sites. These 
                    include mass graves, cyst graves, and the removal of the lower 
                    jaws and other forms of skeletal mutilation perhaps including 
                    the heretofore unrecognized evidence of scalping. Because 
                    of these similarities, we suspect that the cemetery at the 
                    Harrell site dates prior to A.D. 1300 and prior to most of 
                    the Plains Villager era including most of what Krieger included 
                    within the Henrietta focus. It is possible, however, that 
                    the cemetery dates to the beginning of the Plains Villager 
                    occupation. If so, it may not be a coincidence that the Scallorn 
                    point used by the aggressors is associated with older traditions 
                    that lingered to the south in central Texas, while the villagers 
                    represent a new tradition derived from the north.</p>
                  <h3>The Prehistory of the Harrell Site</h3>
                  <p class="text">With all of the above in mind, here is our reinterpretation 
                    of the prehistoric record at the Harrell site, concentrating 
                    on the Late Prehistory. First and foremost we must emphasize 
                    that without further research our educated guesses are just 
                    that. Some of our inferences could be tested by further analysis 
                    of the Harrell site collections. But what we really need are 
                    more well-controlled excavations of prehistoric sites in north 
                    Texas. Today we would use modern geological methods to help 
                    choose sites that have better depositional contexts than that 
                    of the Harrell site&#151;less mixing and fewer repeated occupations. 
                    Today we would collect charcoal samples and soil samples from 
                    individual hearths. Today we would carefully study the animal 
                    bones and the charred plant remains. And so on. </p>
                  <p class="text">Based on today's knowledge, we infer that by 
                    5,000 years ago (3,000 B.C.) hunters and gatherers were regularly 
                    visiting the confluence of the Salt and Clear Forks of the 
                    Brazos. In all likelihood, the area was a favored stopping 
                    place much earlier, probably beginning in Paleoindian times, 
                    but traces of such earlier occupations that may have existed 
                    at the Harrell site were probably destroyed by the meandering 
                    Brazos river. By 5,000 years ago the high terrace upon which 
                    the bulk of the prehistoric record at the Harrell site accumulated 
                    had stabilized and was above the ordinary flood level. The 
                    near edge of the river itself was probably further north than 
                    it is today based on the fact that the river is continuing 
                    to swing southward.</p>
                  <p class="text">During the Middle and Late Archaic or about 
                    5,000 to 1,200 years ago (3000 B.C. to A.D. 800) hunting and 
                    gathering groups who shared much in common with people living 
                    further south in central Texas repeatedly stopped at the river 
                    junction and stayed for short stays. They probably did many 
                    different things at the site and in the area, but their habit 
                    of baking roots and bulbs in earth ovens left the most obvious 
                    archeological signatures&#151;countless hearths and, in one 
                    area near the river, a burned rock midden. The so-called &quot;great 
                    midden&quot; is remarkable because it was covered by flood 
                    deposits before it was used for very long, making it easy 
                    to see the roasting pits that generated the spent fire-cracked 
                    rocks that make up the midden. The age of the midden is unknown, 
                    but it is probably associated with the Archaic period at the 
                    site. The general absence of artifacts suggests that the &quot;great 
                    midden&quot; was a special purpose cooking area that may have 
                    been created on the lower river terrace to keep the area and 
                    the activity separate from the main camp.</p>
                  <p class="text"><br>
                    The main area of human habitation at the Harrell site was 
                    atop the high terrace, even during Archaic times. We would 
                    guess that most of the deeper hearths found there were Archaic 
                    in age, based on the distribution of the dart points. Among 
                    those hearths are a few that are comparable in size and shape 
                    to the roasting pits found in the burned rock midden as well 
                    as many smaller ones of various forms that must have been 
                    used to cook different kinds of foods. There is little doubt 
                    that Archaic life at the Harrell site was much more interesting 
                    and involved than the simple inferences we draw here, but 
                    further speculation serves little purpose.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the early part of the Late Prehistoric, perhaps 
                    around A.D. 800, the Harrell site had become a major habitation 
                    site, a place where people regularly visited and stayed for 
                    weeks or even longer. Over the next 700 years, a tremendous 
                    quantity of cultural debris accumulated on the high terrace 
                    overlooking the river confluence. Based on the large numbers 
                    of basally and small side-notched triangular arrow points 
                    and on the preponderance of shell-tempered pottery, we can 
                    infer that most of the debris accumulated after A.D 1200. 
                    That said, the cemetery could date somewhat earlier than this; 
                    if so, the presence of a well-defined cemetery suggests that 
                    people were already living there for extended periods of time. 
                    In other words, village life at the Harrell site may have 
                    begun prior to the Plains Villager period.</p>
                  <p class="text">Some aspects of daily life were little different 
                    from the Archaic era. Numerous hearths were found in the upper 
                    few feet of the refuse midden including likely baking pits 
                    and smaller hearths as well, several of which resemble hearths 
                    found in the interior of houses at other Plains Villager sites. 
                    But other things changed. The Plains Villagers at Harrell 
                    were apparently farmers, but it is hard to gauge the relative 
                    importance of agriculture. Although there were scapula hoes 
                    and other possible farming implements, only a few corn cobs 
                    were found. Judging from the relatively large numbers of bison 
                    bones as well as the many beveled knives and hide scrapers, 
                    buffalo hunting was very important during this period, perhaps 
                    because more bison were present in the area. </p>

                  <div class="caption">Beveled knives such as 
                    these from the Harrell site were used by Late Prehistoric 
                    Plains groups who hunted buffalo.</div>
                  <p class="text">Despite our misgivings about certain of Krieger's 
                    assumptions, he was right to emphasize the Plains Villager 
                    period at the Harrell site. The distinctive assemblage of 
                    shell-tempered pottery, basally and side-notched triangular 
                    arrow points (Harrell and Washita points), bison-scapula hoes, 
                    handheld mussel tools, diamond beveled knives, hide scrapers, 
                    and small drills has been found at other sites in north Texas. 
                    While the Henrietta focus is still poorly understood, there 
                    is little doubt that these materials are closely related to 
                    other Plains Villager assemblages. In particular, there are 
                    many shared similarities among Washita River phase sites along 
                    the Washita and Canadian River valleys in south-central Oklahoma. 
                    These are comparatively well dated to broadly A.D. 1200-1500 
                    and perhaps mainly A.D. 1300-1450, according to recent syntheses 
                    by Richard Drass.</p>
                  <p class="text">The presence of extensive Plains Villager materials 
                    at the Harrell site can probably be best explained as the 
                    result of the movement of new people into the area, probably 
                    from western or south-central Oklahoma. We cannot rule out 
                    the possibility that local peoples simply adopted the trappings 
                    of more-sophisticated neighboring groups, but we think it 
                    more likely that the Plains Villagers who settled at the Harrell 
                    site shared many customs with other Plains peoples because 
                    they were themselves Plains Indians, people who moved into 
                    the area from the north. </p>
                  <p class="text">The ethnic identity of the Plains Villagers 
                    who lived at the Harrell site is unknown. In the archeological 
                    literature, the possibility that the people who lived at the 
                    site might be ancestors of the historic Wichita is often mentioned. 
                    While this idea was discounted by Krieger, Jack Hughes argued 
                    in his 1968 dissertation, <em>Prehistory of Caddoan-Speaking 
                    Tribes</em>, that the Harrell site represents an early Kichai 
                    (Kitsai) village. The Kichai spoke a minor Caddo language, 
                    but were one of at least six named groups who became consolidated 
                    during the historic era into the Wichita tribe (the others 
                    were the Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Wichita proper, and Waco). 
                    Given the shared similarities among these groups, the great 
                    difficulty in tracing the movement of peoples even in historic 
                    times, and the radical changes the Wichita groups experienced 
                    as the result of the introduction of European guns, horses, 
                    and diseases, we will probably never know for sure. </p>
                  <p class="text"> While we may never know the precise ethnic 
                    identity of the Plains Villagers at the Harrell site, we can 
                    guess that they spoke a Caddoan language (as did many groups 
                    living on and near the southern Plains including the various 
                    Caddo and Wichita groups). Based on linguistic evidence we 
                    know that Caddoan languages were spoken by many groups over 
                    a very large area stretching from east Texas and southeastern 
                    Arkansas across northern Texas and much of Oklahoma and north 
                    into Kansas and the central Plains. Broadly these people all 
                    shared a common cultural heritage, in much the same way that 
                    most Europeans do. Just as in Europe, the peoples who lived 
                    in the southern and central Plains moved repeatedly over the 
                    centuries, split apart, fought with one another, intermarried, 
                    and otherwise transformed their cultures and their identities 
                    in complex ways that defy simple classification. In other 
                    words, the PlainsVillagers who lived at the Harrell site were 
                    part of a prehistoric era that dates hundreds of years before 
                    the earliest historic accounts of named ethnic groups. We 
                    cannot give them a familiar name, which is one of the reasons 
                    why Alex Krieger coined the term Henrietta focus. </p>
                  <p class="text">There is little or no indication that the Harrell 
                    site continued to be occupied after A.D. 1500. A single blue 
                    glass trade bead was found, but it is of a late style dating 
                    no earlier than the Kickapoo village (1850s). Other late historic 
                    Indian remains may well have been mixed in with the burned 
                    remains of the Harrell family's farmhouse. The WPA archeologists 
                    did not recognize any obvious Indian artifacts and discarded 
                    almost all of the historic debris they found. </p>
                  <p class="text">We close by repeating Jack Hughes' shrewd observation: 
                    &quot;Reconstructing the history of the part of the Brazos 
                    on which the Harrell is located is like trying to visualize 
                    a motion picture on the basis of a few still photographs.&quot; 
                    Archeologists may never know enough to replay the movie version 
                    of the long and varied human history of the upper Brazos. 
                    But we can and will learn more as research moves forward into 
                    the 21st century. The artifacts and records from Harrell site 
                    collections from the 1937-1938 WPA excavations remain a critical 
                    and largely untapped source of information awaiting further 
                    study. </p>
