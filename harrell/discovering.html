                  <p class="text">In the Fall of 1937, archeologist A.T. Jackson 
                    of the University of Texas at Austin spotted a suspicious 
                    line of broken limestone rocks eroding out of a cutbank on 
                    the south side of the Brazos River just below where its Salt 
                    and Clear Forks came together in southern Young County. Jackson 
                    was searching for Indian campsites in the area that would 
                    be inundated by Possum Kingdom Reservoir, then under construction. 
                    Jackson rightly suspected that the stones marked an area were 
                    prehistoric peoples had built cooking hearths. </p>
                  <p class="text"> He was intrigued because the fire-cracked (or 
                    &quot;burned&quot;) rocks were buried by 7 feet of mud and 
                    sand left by countless floods along the sometimes mighty Brazos 
                    River. Here, Jackson realized, was a perfect place for an 
                    archeological excavation that might shed light on the unwritten 
                    history of the region. The property where Jackson found the 
                    deeply buried hearth rocks was part of the M.D. Harrell farm. 
                    He soon obtained the landowner's permission to conduct a major 
                    dig there the following year to search for deeply buried evidence 
                    of prehistoric life. </p>
                  <p class="text">Jackson's survey was a continuation of a state-wide 
                    archeological survey program begun in the mid-1920s by Professor 
                    James E. Pearce at the University of Texas. Pearce, sometimes  
                    called the &quot;father of Texas archeology,&quot; was a visionary 
                    who worked tirelessly to establish an anthropology department 
                    at the university and get the state-wide survey underway. 
                    &quot;Survey&quot; to Pearce meant locating and digging important 
                    archeological sites in different areas of Texas. Unfortunately, 
                    his approach to archeological excavation was not methodical 
                    and his early excavations sometimes were little more than 
                    artifact mining operations. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Pearce apparently believed that by amassing 
                    large artifact collections he would be able to understand 
                    broad cultural patterns. Like many early archeologists, he 
                    had a static view of prehistory and failed to understand that 
                    many of the artifact collections he studied represented thousands 
                    of years of cultural development. Jackson was Pearce's chief 
                    assistant and a former newspaper reporter who quickly became 
                    adept at archeology. He was naturally curious and skilled 
                    at making do with whatever conditions he found himself in 
                    as he traveled across Texas in search of places where important 
                    archeological sites could be found. </p>
                  <p class="text"> In the 1920s, most of the work was concentrated 
                    in the Austin area with brief forays in more distant areas 
                    of the state. Pearce struggled to find adequate funding to 
                    fulfill his vision of sampling the archeology of the entire 
                    state. By the early 1930s the National Research Council of 
                    the National Academy of Sciences had established a Committee 
                    on State Archaeological Surveys to dole out small grants to 
                    universities in different parts of the country so that information 
                    could be salvaged from the areas scheduled to be flooded by 
                    reservoirs. At the time, reservoirs were being planned and 
                    built all across the country to prevent floods, improve water 
                    supplies, and generate hydroelectricity. While such projects 
                    were good for the country, they were also destroying many 
                    cultural resources such as Indian campsites as well as early 
                    historic settlements. To help lessen these losses, the federal 
                    government instigated what would become a three-decade-long 
                    program of &quot;salvage archeology&quot; that was formalized 
                    after World War II.</p>
                  <h3><a name="wpa"></a>WPA Archeology</h3>
                  <p class="text">In the 1930s the country was mired in the Great 
                    Depression following the collapse of the stock market in 1929. 
                    Money and jobs were scarce and unemployment ballooned. The 
                    federal government stepped in with what became known as the 
                    New Deal, a set of relief programs designed to get the country 
                    back on its economic feet. One of the most successful was 
                    the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a program that put 
                    thousands of Americans back to work between 1935-1941. The 
                    WPA guidelines called for &quot;useful&quot; projects that 
                    would benefit the public and that could be executed immediately 
                    with a high proportion of the total costs being labor. The 
                    projects also had to be near areas where most of the unemployed 
                    lived, rural Texas being a prime example.</p>
                  <p class="text">The WPA was both boon and bane to American archeology. 
                    Archeology, as it turned out, was a perfect fit for the WPA. 
                    One or two trained archeologists could oversee the labor of 
                    dozens of unskilled workers. Under the WPA program massive 
                    excavations of unprecedented scale were carried out at hundreds 
                    of archeological sites across the country between 1935-1941, 
                    especially in the south and southeast where the unemployed 
                    were concentrated. </p>
                  <p class="text">In Texas, many of the projects were administered 
                    through the University of Texas at Austin under Dr. J. Gilbert 
                    McAllister, who took over from Pearce. Pearce died in 1938 
                    soon after he was appointed as the first director of the Texas 
                    Memorial Museum, the creation of which had consumed his latter 
                    years. McAllister was a cultural anthropologist, not an archeologist, 
                    but he proved to be a much better administrator than Pearce. 
                    McAllister continued to rely on A.T. Jackson, but he also 
                    began bringing in academically trained archeologists like 
                    Alex D. Krieger and J. Charles Kelley. The WPA mandate allowed 
                    the UT archeologists to carry out large-scale excavations 
                    in many locales ranging from northeast Texas to central Texas. 
                    In the case of the Harrell site and a series of terrace sites 
                    along the Colorado River upstream from Austin, the make-work 
                    goals were integrated with the fledgling reservoir salvage 
                    efforts funded by the federal government. </p>
                  <p class="text">A.T. Jackson served as Archeologist in Charge 
                    of the WPA work at the planned Possum Kingdom Reservoir. He 
                    assigned George R. Fox to supervise the WPA excavations there 
                    beginning in the fall of 1938. Not much is known about Fox, 
                    aside from the fact that he returned home to Michigan soon 
                    after the WPA work ended at Possum Kingdom Reservoir was completed. 
                    Fox does not appear to have been trained formally as an archeologist. 
                    Regardless, his notes reveal an organized man who followed 
                    Jackson's guidelines methodically. Jackson, in obvious reaction 
                    to Pearce's lack of methodological rigor, produced a Manual 
                    of Archaeological Field Work in 1937. Carbon copies of this 
                    manuscript were used by the WPA archeologists under Jackson 
                    as a basic guide to field methods. The systematic approach 
                    that Jackson laid out was an important step forward for Texas 
                    archeology.</p>
                  <p class="text">Jackson's organizational plan for the work at 
                    Harrell and other sites specified that each crew would &quot;consist 
                    of approximately forty-five laborers, three cooks, two clerks, 
                    one draftsman, and an assistant archeologist&quot; under a 
                    &quot;crew archeologist.&quot; Fox served as the project superintendent 
                    or &quot;crew archeologist.&quot; His assistant was the timekeeper 
                    who kept track of the hours worked by the unskilled laborers. 
                    The clerks typed the daily field notes and many forms, while 
                    the draftsman was in charge of drawing maps and field sketches. 
                    The men in skilled positions were paid at a higher rate and 
                    were chosen because of their qualifications. All of the unskilled 
                    laborers were selected from the &quot;relief rolls&quot; of 
                    unemployed men from north Texas communities. </p>
                  <p class="text">For a six-month period from the fall of 1938 
                    through the spring of 1939, the M. D. Harrell farm became 
                    a work camp. Barns and outbuildings were joined by a small 
                    village of temporary shelters, clusters of canvas tents for 
                    workers, and makeshift laboratory areas for artifact processing. 
                    Crews wielding shovels and picks methodically excavated 5-x-5' 
                    squares laid out in neat grid patterns in three areas on two 
                    of the river terraces. The center of most of the attention 
                    was to be the family garden plot, high above the other areas. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">At the time, the archeologists recognized three 
                    river terraces along the Brazos. The first and lowest was 
                    the modern floodplain which was not present in the immediate 
                    site area. Through time, the Brazos River was slowly carving 
                    its channel southward and eroding the second terrace and creating 
                    the cutbank that Jackson had first examined. The top of the 
                    second terrace was about 22-25' above the normal level of 
                    the river. Major floods could still reach the top of the second 
                    terrace. Further back from the river was the third terrace, 
                    which lay about 36-40' above river level and beyond the reach 
                    of even the worst floods. Modern geological work has shown 
                    that the upper Brazos and its tributaries has a complex set 
                    of terraces that formed at different periods of times and 
                    that have been reshaped by periods of erosion. The &quot;third&quot; 
                    terrace in WPA terms, probably formed at least five to six 
                    thousand years ago.</p>

                    Field drawing drafted by Raymond Bland; TARL Archives. </div>
                  <p class="text">Work began on the river edge of the second terrace 
                    atop the bluff where Jackson had spotted the line of hearth 
                    stones 7 feet below the surface. This terrace was being steadily 
                    undercut by the two rivers, a process that exposed the hearth 
                    stones and would have eventually destroyed all the buried 
                    evidence. Excavation 1 uncovered what was termed the &quot;Great 
                    Midden,&quot; a rather grand title for what proved to be a 
                    burned rock midden&#151;a sizable accumulation of heat-fractured 
                    rocks nearly 28 feet in diameter, but less than a foot thick. 
                    Within the expanse of burned limestone and sandstone fragments 
                    were three circular depressions&#151;the remains of baking 
                    or roasting pits-filled with ashes and charcoal and little 
                    more. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today archeologists would take a great deal 
                    of interest in the burned rock midden at the Harrell site. 
                    Unlike the burned rock middens characteristic of the Edwards 
                    Plateau in central Texas, the &quot;great midden&quot; accumulated 
                    on a terrace surface that was soon sealed by flood deposits. 
                    Central Texas middens typically formed on stable surfaces 
                    and sometimes grew to 6 feet or more in thickness and several 
                    acres in extent. Often the traces of the baking pits responsible 
                    for the burned rock accumulation are obliterated by the mass 
                    of rock. In contrast, the burned rock midden at the Harrell 
                    site is preserved in an &quot;incipient&quot; stage early 
                    in its formation. <br>
                    <br>
                    It is obvious that the &quot;great midden&quot; at Harrell 
                    formed as the result of the use and reuse of the three baking 
                    pits, which can be seen in the photographs and drawings. Based 
                    on ethnographic accounts from many different areas of North 
                    America and on modern experimental work, archeologists now 
                    have a good understanding of the process known as earth oven 
                    cooking. At the Harrell site, like countless other sites in 
                    Texas, plant foods such as roots and bulbs (no animal bones 
                    were found in the midden), were baked in layered arrangements 
                    of heated rocks, green plants, food, and earth known as earth 
                    ovens. The heated rocks held and slowly released stored energy 
                    (heat), which caused the green plants (such as fresh-cut grass) 
                    to give off steam, thus slowly baking the roots in moist low 
                    heat. The green layers also kept the roots from burning and 
                    separated the food from the earth layer. Additional layers 
                    of heated rocks are sometimes added above the food layer. 
                    Capping it all was a thick layer of earth that served as an 
                    insulation layer to hold in the steamy heat.</p>
                  <p class="text">Some earth ovens likely continued cooking for 
                    as long as 24 hours or more, although the pits at the Harrell 
                    site are relatively small and probably represent shorter cooking 
                    episodes. Once the food was done, the earthen cap, upper rock 
                    layer, and top layer of green plants were peeled back so the 
                    food can be removed. Notice in the photographs how the rocks 
                    are arrayed around the pits. Most of the scattered rocks represent 
                    fire-cracked rocks from earlier ovens that must have been 
                    cleaned out of the pits when fresh, intact rocks were added 
                    at the start of each cooking episode.</p>
                  <p class="text">While Fox and Jackson had a rudimentary understanding 
                    of how the &quot;great midden&quot; formed, they were sorely 
                    disappointed by the lack of artifacts and soon decided to 
                    abandon excavations in this area of the site. First, however, 
                    the crew cleaned back the bluff face and recorded 25 feet 
                    of multi-colored alternating layers of sands, silts, and clays, 
                    each reflecting a different period of deposition. They also 
                    dug a trench beneath the burned rock midden in search of more 
                    deeply buried artifacts. They were again disappointed by the 
                    lack of what was then considered to be a worthwhile find-a 
                    projectile point or formal stone tool. They did note the presence 
                    of scattered flint chips, showing that prehistoric peoples 
                    were in the area while many of the layers formed.</p>
                  <p class="text">In hindsight, the WPA archeologists simply lacked 
                    enough knowledge of geology and sedimentation to appreciate 
                    what they had found in the second river terrace. Today the 
                    terrace exposures they created would be carefully studied 
                    by specialists trained in reading the depositional layers, 
                    like those found along the Brazos. Instead of being disappointed 
                    by the sparseness of the artifacts, a good modern archeologist 
                    would realize that here was the opportunity to study brief 
                    moments in prehistory that were sealed and protected from 
                    mixing by the flood deposits. By obtaining radiocarbon samples 
                    from different layers, a geologically minded archeologist 
                    (or geoarcheologist) would be able to reconstruct the depositional 
                    history of the river terrace and tie this to the archeological 
                    finds. Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20.</p>
                  <p class="text">Also on the second terrace, the WPA crews opened 
                    up Excavation 2 around a gully area downstream from the first 
                    excavation area, where large limestone slabs were eroding 
                    out. Several hearths were uncovered, but the area was found 
                    to be badly disturbed by the gully and was soon abandoned.</p>
                  <p class="text">The remainder of the work was centered on Excavation 
                    3, the high third terrace where the Harrell family's farmhouse 
                    and barnyard had been. The house had burned a few years earlier 
                    and the family had moved to Graham, but still maintained the 
                    farm. Beneath the Harrell family's vegetable garden, the WPA 
                    archeologists encountered a prehistoric cemetery along with 
                    a quantity of burned rock cooking hearths and ovens. </p>
                  <h3><a name="3"></a>Hearths and Burials: Exacavation 3</h3>
                  <p class="text">In Excavation 3, investigators uncovered an 
                    enormous hearth field with well over a hundred cooking hearths 
                    and a small prehistoric cemetery with some 32 human interments. 
                    Crews dug to a depth of 5 feet over an area roughly 135 feet 
                    long by 85 feet wide. They then dug down an additional 5 feet 
                    in the western half, excavating, in all, almost 90,000 cubic 
                    feet of soil. The terrace deposits had two main strata: the 
                    top layer, a dark, organic-rich midden (refuse) deposit, contained 
                    the great majority of the cultural material; underneath this, 
                    roughly 5 feet below the surface, was a stratum of red, sandy 
                    clay.</p>
                  <p class="text">The midden varied from 2 &frac12; to nearly 
                    6 feet in thickness and was made up of loose dark soil full 
                    of ashes, charcoal, shell, and bone. The contact with the 
                    lower, red clay layer, was described as highly irregular and 
                    pockmarked by small depressions (areas of darker soil) which 
                    Fox thought might be refuse pits. None, however, had a definite 
                    pit shape or was found to contain concentrated debris. The 
                    unevenness of the contact between the two layers added to 
                    the difficulty in plotting the artifacts.</p>
                  <p class="text">Unlike the so-called &quot;great midden&quot; 
                    at the site, the midden in Excavation 3 was rich with cultural 
                    debris and artifacts&#151;chipped stone tools, projectile 
                    points, pottery sherds, shell, animal bones, and other items 
                    discarded by various peoples living at the site over time. 
                    Archeologists call such deposits refuse or kitchen middens. 
                    Within the midden layer, workers found many rock-lined pits 
                    and circular arrangements of burned rocks of the sort commonly 
                    known as hearths, although many probably functioned much like 
                    the baking pits found within the &quot;great midden.&quot; 
                    These cooking hearths and ovens&#151;more than 135 of them&#151;were 
                    scattered rather evenly throughout the upper deposit. Most 
                    were constructed of limestone slabs likely gathered from the 
                    hills along the valley margins less than a mile away. Some 
                    hearths had been constructed within pits, depressions filled 
                    with dark midden soil that extended into a red clay layer 
                    below. </p>
                  <p class="text">Most hearths were little more than circular 
                    clusters of broken limestone slabs that appeared to rest on 
                    a flat surface. Others were dish-shaped, or concave, rather 
                    than flat, and obviously had been built within shallow pits 
                    or basins. Another distinct hearth form was a slab-lined pit 
                    with its bottom paved by flat stones encircled by upright 
                    or angled slabs. Still other hearths were irregular, steeply 
                    sloping arrangements of rock that probably represent slab-lined 
                    pits that had been partially dismantled. Although some of 
                    the hearths contained several layers of rock, most consisted 
                    of a single layer of limestone fragments in an irregular circular 
                    shape, measuring about 3 to 4 feet across. Amid the stones, 
                    workers found the tell-tale remains of prehistoric cooking: 
                    ash, bits of charcoal, burned and unburned animal bones, and 
                    mussel shell fragments.</p>
                  <p class="text">Burials were confined largely to the western 
                    edge of the excavation area, a locale that must have been 
                    specifically designated by prehistoric peoples as a cemetery 
                    or burial ground. Only a few of the graves overlapped one 
                    another, suggesting that the locations of the burials were 
                    marked or known to those who placed the graves. Depths of 
                    the graves varied from roughly 3 to 6 feet below the surface. 
                    As described more fully in the section on the <a href="cemetery.html" class="text">Cemetery</a>, 
                    interments were both in single as well as group graves. </p>
