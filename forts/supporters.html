     <p class="text">Dozens of individuals and organizations from across the 
        state contributed to the Frontier Forts project in countless ways, from 
        contributing funds to writing text and providing other resources that 
        so vividly convey the frontier experience in Texas. The exhibits you see&#151;the 
        first &quot;thematic&quot; project on TBH&#151;are a result of this remarkable 
      collaboration and teamwork. TBH Contributing Editor <strong>Steve Dia</strong>l planned and created the exhibits and wrote much of the content. Professors <strong>Robert Wooster</strong> and <strong>Ty Cashion </strong>each contributed historical sections, and author and historian <strong>Thomas Tyree Smith</strong> served as project reviewer. Former teacher and author <strong>Lisa Waller Rogers </strong>contributed content for the student interactive. </p>
     <p class="text">TBH Co-Editor <strong>Susan Dia</strong>l developed and directed the project, did much of the photography, and acquired historic images and documents used through. Webmaster <strong>Meg Kemp</strong> is responsible 
       for the imaginative construction of the site and its seamless navigation; 
       she also created several of the striking graphics topping several of the 
       exhibit pages. Editorial Assistant <strong>Clayton Drescher</strong> created maps to help 
       locate forts and settlements across the state.  </p>
     <h3>Sponsors </h3>
      <p class="text">Funding for the Frontier Forts project was provided through 
        grants by the <strong>Summerfield G. Roberts Foundation</strong>, <strong>Texas Preservation 
        Trust Fund</strong> (Texas Historical Commission ), the <strong>Houston Endowment</strong>,

        contribution to the Kids pages was provided by the Writers' League of
