                  <p class="text">During the 10 years after the battle of San 
                    Jacinto, the fledgling Republic of Texas was scarcely able 
                    to keep Mexican soldiers beyond its border or raiding Indians 
                    out of its settlements. Annexation to the United States made 
                    Texas frontier vulnerabilities the problem and responsibility 
                    of the U.S. Army. This was everywhere a daunting and frequently 
                    thankless task, but nowhere was the army's mission more complex 
                    than on the Rio Grande frontier. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The stretch of the Rio Grande from modern Del 
                    Rio to the Gulf of Mexico presented unique military issues. 
                    The army's primary mission there was to enforce on the ground 
                    a national boundary that was still largely a theory drawn 
                    on a map. Local tensions flared into cross-border violence 
                    as a new Anglo-American legal system was imposed on Spanish-Mexican 
                    traditions. Lipan Apache and Kickapoo raided north of the 
                    border from their refuges in Mexico. Comanche and Kiowa swept 
                    down from the Plains to raid villages south of the river. 
                    The region would be a military and diplomatic headache for 
                    the United States government throughout the 19th Century.</p>
                  <p class="text"> In the mid-1700s, the area had evolved as an 
                    extension of the northern Mexican cattle culture, the domain 
                    of the <em>vaquero</em>. Colonel Jos&eacute; de Escand&oacute;n 
                    began moving colonists from the interior of Mexico to the 
                    Rio Grande in 1748. Within a year, he had laid out the townships 
                    of Reynosa and Camargo on the south bank of the river in its 
                    lower valley. Revilla was established in 1750, Mier in 1753. 
                    Two years later, Laredo was planted on the north bank, making 
                    it an exception among the 20 towns Escand&oacute;n developed. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">By the end of the century, Indian raids from 
                    the north and west were terrorizing the ranchos and villages 
                    Escand&oacute;n had established. In 1771, Comanches drove 
                    the settlers at Laredo from the north bank to the south bank, 
                    where the town of Nuevo Laredo was established. The next year, 
                    King Charles III of Spain ordered that all missions and presidios 
                    in Texas, except those at B&eacute;jar (San Antonio) and La 
                    Bah&iacute;a (Goliad), be abandoned. </p>
                  <p class="text">It was just this problem that Anglo empresarios 
                    were recruited to solve, through the creation of &quot;buffer&quot; 
                    settlements or, at least, alternative targets for the Indians. 
                    It was a scheme launched in desperation, and the new nation 
                    of Mexico maintained it, even as control of Texas slipped 
                    into Anglo hands. Mexico soon had two hostile forces assaulting 
                    its northern frontier. But the continuing dispute with the 
                    Anglos was a mere abstraction for many residents of Mexico 
                    who were more concerned with the Comanche threat. By the mid-1840s, 
                    Comanches were reported raiding in Zacatecas, nearly 500 miles 
                    below the border, and at Quer&eacute;taro, less than 150 miles 
                    from Mexico City. </p>
                  <p class="text">The U.S. Army arrived on the Rio Grande in 1846, 
                    shortly after Texas was annexed to the United States. General 
                    Zachary Taylor's &quot;army of observation&quot; was stationed 
                    first at Corpus Christi, then moved to the valley of the lower 
                    Rio Grande. War with Mexico soon followed, and the army established 
                    Fort Brown near the mouth of the river. Supplies for Taylor's 
                    invasion force were shipped upstream, where steamboats took 
                    on fuel at a private dock known as Davis' Landing. By war's 
                    end, the army's presence in the valley had attracted considerable 
                    Anglo commerce and settlement. Fort Brown spawned the town 
                    of Brownsville. Davis' Landing became Rio Grande City. </p>
                  <p class="text"> An army post established in 1848 at Davis' 
                    Landing was named Ringgold Barracks and, 30 years later, Fort 
                    Ringgold. Fort McIntosh was established upriver at Laredo 
                    in 1849. Unsettled social and political conditions in Mexico, 
                    and the diplomatic intrigue which accompanied two world wars, 
                    would keep all three of the valley forts in operation until 
                    the 1940s, with Forts Brown and McIntosh surviving as military 
                    posts until after World War II. </p>
                  <p class="text">The international issues were difficult enough 
                    in the lower Rio Grande valley, but the army's task was even 
                    more formidable upriver from Laredo. The term, &quot;Nueces 
                    Strip,&quot; describes that portion of the area between the 
                    Rio Grande and the Nueces where the two rivers flow parallel 
                    to each other before the Nueces makes a bend to the east. 
                    The roads from the old Presidio de San Juan Bautista crossed 
                    into Texas through this region, and the Mexican General Adrian 
                    Woll passed this way with his invasion force that seized San 
                    Antonio in 1842. It also was a region through which settlers 
                    were attacked by Indians from all directions.</p>
                  <p class="text">One of the Comanches' favored travel routes 
                    reached the Rio Grande by way of Las Moras Creek, fed by prolific 
                    springs near the low hills east of modern Del Rio. Some sources 
                    indicate that once south of the Rio Grande, the Comanche trail 
                    proceeded southeasterly&#151;parallel to the river&#151;for 
                    hundreds of miles through the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. 
                    Another branch of this trail skirted the interior cities of 
                    Monclova, Monterrey, and Saltillo.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo set the terms 
                    by which the United States and Mexico ended nearly three years 
                    of war in 1848. The treaty required that the United States 
                    keep its Indians&#151;both the Comanche and their Kiowa allies&#151;from 
                    raiding in Mexico.</p>
                  <p class="text">Below the point where Las Moras Creek flows 
                    into the Rio Grande, and above Laredo, was a crossing of the 
                    river known as El Paso del &Aacute;guila. The army in 1849 
                    established a post a short distance above the crossing. Initially 
                    called Rio Grande Station, it was subsequently named Fort 
                    Duncan. With the inevitable arrival of Anglo traders, a town 
                    site was laid out near the post. The village became known 
                    as &quot;Eagle Pass.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">Two weeks before Fort Duncan was established, 
                    the army located a post on the Leona River between the Rio 
                    Grande and San Antonio. Soon to be named Fort Inge, it would 
                    be on a line of posts extending southwesterly from the Red 
                    River through Henri Castro's Alsatian colony west of San Antonio.

                  <p class="text">The Nueces Strip marked the confluence of the 
                    army's first two frontier assignments in Texas: maintaining 
                    the integrity of the nation's new southern border and defending 
                    the western settlements from Indian attack. Together, Forts 
                    Duncan, Inge, and McIntosh gave the army a significant presence 
                    in the region. But whatever its contribution to international 
                    diplomacy, that presence was inadequate to keep Indians away 
                    from the settlements, on either side of the Rio Grande. </p>
                  <p class="text">The army's problem there was not exclusively, 
                    or even primarily, with Comanches and Kiowas. The Lipan Apaches 
                    had been pushed off the High Plains by the Comanche, then 
                    off the Edwards Plateau. As if caught between a hammer and 
                    anvil, they had been pummeled by the troops of Spanish Colonel 
                    Juan de Ugalde in the canyon of the Sabinal River. In the 
                    mid-1800s, they still lurked in the canyons of the Balcones 
                    Escarpment and raided settlements and travelers from Laredo 
                    to San Antonio. When pursued, they escaped to Mexico.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Lipan had a checkered relationship with 
                    Anglo-Texans. Dedicated enemies of the Comanche, they fought 
                    them as scouts and warriors in the service of John Henry Moore 
                    and John Coffee Hays' rangers. But when not enlisted to fight 
                    Comanches, they preyed on the <em>ranchos</em> of the Nueces 
                    Strip and the farmsteads of the Hill Country.</p>
                  <p class="text">The recently arrived Kickapoos would be almost 
                    as troublesome. Originating in the northern Great Lakes region, 
                    they had moved south in response to pressure from white settlers, 
                    and the Spanish had offered them land with the Cherokee in 
                    northeast Texas. Both tribes were attacked by Texas troops 
                    in 1839, and some of the Kickapoo escaped to Mexico. They 
                    accepted a grant of land from the Mexican government and raided 
                    Texas settlers from villages south of the Rio Grande.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Until the mid-1850s, most of the U.S. Army's 
                    energies in Texas were directed at constructing new forts 
                    and pacifying the brush country south of the Nueces River. 
                    Texas civilian forces, sometimes denominated &quot;mounted 
                    volunteers&quot; and sometimes &quot;rangers,&quot; frequently 
                    were enlisted as auxiliary troops for the army. In 1850, 10 
                    companies of the Army's 2nd Dragoons and 1st Infantry commanded 
                    by Captain William J. Hardee, assisted by rangers under William 
                    &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Wallace, conducted a sweep of the Nueces 
                    Strip that produced four engagements with hostile Indians.</p>
                  <p class="text"> By the time of Hardee's campaign, it had become 
                    apparent that the army lacked sufficient resources for its 
                    mission in southern Texas. Comanche raiders struck ranches 
                    north of Corpus Christi in 1849, and a similar raid through 
                    Refugio and Castroville in 1850 netted the Indians an estimated 
                    400 horses. Finding its Rio Grande forts inadequate to protect 
                    the region, the Army placed posts along the Nueces&#151;Fort 
                    Merrill, established in 1850 about 40 miles northwest of Corpus 
                    Christi, and Fort Ewell, added in 1852 at the crossing of 
                    the Nueces between Laredo and San Antonio. <br>
                    <br>
                    Discovery of gold in California in 1848 resulted in yet another 
                    mission for the army, that of defending the southern transcontinental 
                    travel route from San Antonio to El Paso. In 1849, Lieutenants 
                    W.H.C. Whiting and William F. Smith of the army's Corps of 
                    Topographical Engineers returned to San Antonio from El Paso 
                    by way of the Devil's River, the Nueces, and the Leona, guided 
                    by veteran frontiersman Henry Skillman. This route became 
                    known as the &quot;government&quot; road, and within a few 
                    years Skillman was using it for a mail and passenger coach 
                    service between San Antonio and El Paso.<br>
                    <br>
                    The army began revising its western defense strategy in 1852. 
                    New posts a hundred miles beyond the frontier settlements 
                    replaced the interior forts. One, soon to be named Fort Clark, 
                    was positioned at Las Moras Springs near the intersection 
                    of the government road and the Comanche's old eastern raiding 
                    trail. With aggressive patrolling by the Army's Mounted Rifles 
                    and John S. &quot;Rip&quot; Ford's rangers, Indian raids in 
                    south Texas began to diminish. Fort Ewell was abandoned in 
                    1854, and Fort Merrill followed in 1855.</p>
                  <p class="text">The 2nd Dragoons were transferred to Kansas 
                    in 1855, but replacements arrived early the next year in the 
                    form of the new 2nd Cavalry. The regiment included 16 future 
                    Civil War generals in its officer corps, including Colonel 
                    Albert Sidney Johnston, Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee, 
                    and Hardee, now a major with a reputation as a vigorous Indian 
                    fighter. In 1857, companies of the 2nd Cavalry from Forts 
                    Clark, Inge, and McIntosh fought 10 engagements, the greatest 
                    number of actions against hostile Indians in south Texas by 
                    any U.S. Army regiment during the entire pre-Civil War period.

                  <p class="text">United States troops vacated all of the Texas 
                    forts when the state seceded. &quot;Rip&quot; Ford's Texas 
                    Mounted Rifles were primarily responsible for defense of the 
                    border against Indians, Mexicans, and United States forces 
                    early in the Civil War, and Ford returned to the Rio Grande 
                    late in the conflict to participate in its last battle. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The border posts were the first to be reoccupied 
                    by the U.S. Army after the war ended. The army had some 40,000 
                    soldiers in the state by the fall of 1865, most located either 
                    among the population centers to assist in Reconstruction duties 
                    or on the Rio Grande to guard against the French who were 
                    then occupying Mexico.</p>
                  <p class="text">Within two years, the wartime volunteer units 
                    had mustered out of service, and the remaining regulars numbered 
                    only about 5,000. The units posted to the Rio Grande included 
                    the 41st Infantry, a regiment of black enlisted men and white 
                    officers. Colonel Ranald Mackenzie located the unit's headquarters 
                    at Ringgold Barracks, and by the fall of 1868, the 41st provided 
                    garrisons for Fort Clark, Fort Duncan, and Fort Inge. It shared 
                    Duncan and Inge with companies of the 9th Cavalry, a regiment 
                    also manned by black troopers and white officers.</p>
                  <p class="text">When Company D of the 41st Infantry arrived 
                    at Fort Inge, it was commanded by Lieutenant John L. Bullis. 
                    Over the next 15 years, Bullis would become almost legendary 
                    on the western frontier for his leadership of the army's Seminole-Negro 
                    Indian scouts. </p>
                  <p class="text">Fort Inge was abandoned in the spring of 1869. 
                    The 41st Infantry's headquarters were transferred to Fort 
                    McKavett, and the regiment was combined with the 38th Infantry 
                    to form a new regiment, the 24th Infantry. From 1870 through 
                    1872, three black units&#151;the 9th Cavalry and the 24th 
                    and 25th Infantry&#151;provided the garrisons for Forts Clark 
                    and Duncan. </p>
                  <p class="text">By the mid-1870s, increased traffic and commerce 
                    had combined with the rapid development of a cattle industry 
                    to make the Nueces Strip a target-rich environment for Indians 
                    and outlaws from both sides of the Rio Grande. The army's 
                    pre-Civil War supply system had been instrumental in developing 
                    wagon roads between Corpus Christi and Laredo (Fort McIntosh), 
                    Laredo and Fort Duncan, and San Antonio and Fort Clark. New 
                    communities had grown up near the forts&#151;Brackett (or 
                    Brackettville) near Fort Clark, Uvalde (an anglicized tribute 
                    to the Spanish soldier Ugalde) near Fort Inge, and Eagle Pass 
                    near Fort Duncan. They furnished materials and civilian labor 
                    for army construction projects and served as supply centers 
                    for the ranches that began to grow up in the region.</p>
                  <p class="text">Spanish-Mexican cattle roamed wild by the hundreds 
                    of thousands in south Texas after the Civil War. Locally, 
                    they were worth as little as $2 per head, but on the northern 
                    markets they brought $40 or more. Development of a system 
                    to reach those markets set off an &quot;open season&quot; 
                    of cow hunting in the brush country. Rustling and trafficking 
                    in stolen livestock became profitable enterprises.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1875, a gang of about 30 outlaws terrorized 
                    travelers and residents in and around Corpus Christi. A wounded 
                    member of the band told his captors that the gang had come 
                    from south of the Rio Grande in several smaller groups, and 
                    had rendezvoused near the town with the intention of sacking 
                    it completely. Texas Governor Richard Coke immediately directed 
                    Leander McNelly, captain of a special company of rangers, 
                    to deal with problems on the border.</p>
                  <p class="text">As matters developed, international banditry 
                    was beyond the effective control of state forces. The situation 
                    ultimately improved only because of a series of U.S. Army 
                    incursions into Mexico that could have provoked open warfare 
                    between the two nations. The first of these expeditions, in 
                    the summer of 1876 and fall of 1877, were directed by &quot;Pecos 
                    Bill&quot; Shafter, commander at Fort Duncan. Shafter relied 
                    primarily on 10th Cavalry troopers&#151;the original &quot;buffalo 
                    soldiers&quot;&#151;and Bullis's Seminole-Negro Indian scouts, 
                    supported by detachments of 24th and 25th Infantry. Several 
                    attacks were made on Lipan or Kickapoo camps, most with some 
                    degree of success. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mexican authorities protested, but took no action 
                    until Mackenzie led a larger expedition across the Rio Grande 
                    in 1878. The effort was notable mainly for the confrontation 
                    it produced with a Mexican army. Conflict was avoided, however, 
                    and the affair prompted Mexico to keep a stronger military 
                    presence near the border that helped suppress raiding in Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">Brackettville became the county seat of Kinney 
                    County when it was organized in 1876. To the west, an agricultural 
                    development sprung up around irrigation canals fed by San 
                    Felipe Springs. The small town, San Felipe del Rio, received 
                    a post office in 1883, shortened its name to Del Rio, and 
                    became the county seat of Val Verde County in 1885.</p>
                  <p class="text">Revolutionary activity in Mexico spilled over 
                    the border into Texas after 1910, and the U.S. Army sent forces 
                    across the Rio Grande in 1916. Although troops from Fort Clark 
                    and Fort Duncan were not directly involved in the operation, 
                    the political unrest provided sufficient reason for the army 
                    to maintain its presence all along the international boundary. 
                    Soon, the United States was preparing to enter World War I, 
                    and both Fort Clark and Fort Duncan received a new lease on 
                    life. Duncan became a training facility, and had 16,000 soldiers 
                    on post in 1916.</p>
                  <p class="text">At war's end, however, the futures of the two 
                    forts were set on different paths. The army abandoned Fort 
                    Duncan in 1927. The City of Eagle Pass began maintaining the 
                    property, and in 1935 turned it into a park. With the onset 
                    of World War II, the army accepted use of the property for 
                    an officers club and swimming pool for personnel of the Eagle 
                    Pass Army Airfield. The property has since reverted to historic 
                    status. Seven of the original buildings remain, and the former 
                    post headquarters houses a museum.</p>
                  <p class="text">Fort Clark became home to the Fifth Cavalry 
                    and was refurbished in the 1930s. The post entered its twilight 
                    years as another world war approached. Its troopers participated 
                    in cavalry war games near Marfa in 1936. Its last regular 
                    garrison went to war in 1944, and the fort became a camp for 
                    German prisoners of war. The army abandoned Fort Clark in 
                    1946 and sold it for salvage. The property was operated as 
                    a corporate retreat until 1971, when it became a residential 
                    development. Most of the buildings have been converted to 
                    private use. The Fort Clark Historical Society maintains a 
                    museum in the former post guardhouse.</p>
