                  <p class="text">Long after the horse soldiers' time had passed, 
                    Fort Clark was still a cavalry post. Wheeling in dusty drills 
                    and negotiating narrow canyon trails, the troopers of the 
                    5th Cavalry maintained the army's historical presence on the 
                    Rio Grande. They were an anachronism between two world wars. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"> They also were heirs to a romantic tradition. 
                    The regiment had originally been organized in 1855 as the 
                    2nd Cavalry and led by Albert Sidney Johnston and Robert E. 
                    Lee. By 1938, regimental commander George S. Patton Jr. stood 
                    at the end of a line of officers distinguished by their dash 
                    and daring. Patton died in France in 1945, one of the most 
                    renowned field generals of the 20th Century. Fort Clark was 
                    abandoned early the next year, a costly relic of American 
                    frontier warfare. </p>
                  <p class="text">Today, the traveler turning south off U.S. Highway 
                    90 at Brackettville enters the residential community of Fort 
                    Clark Springs, the remains of one of the U.S. Army's longest 
                    occupations in Texas. Up the hill, a bronze statue stands 
                    post above the clear waters of Las Moras Creek. It is a figure 
                    reminiscent of the traditional ceremony acknowledging a fallen 
                    comrade&#151;the solitary horse, trooper's boots reversed 
                    in the stirrups of an empty saddle. </p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the fort's remaining 19th Century buildings 
                    are in private use. Officers' quarters and enlisted men's 
                    barracks&#151;some dating from the 1850s&#151;face the first 
                    parade ground, now part of a par 3 golf course. The charred 
                    remains of the old post headquarters still bear the date, 
                    &quot;1857,&quot; etched in the soft limestone blocks above 
                    the original doorway. Down the hill and past the site of the 
                    first commissary is one of the largest spring-fed swimming 
                    pools in Texas, built in 1939 when General Jonathan Wainwright 
                    commanded the post.</p>
                  <p class="text">The springs of Las Moras&#151;&quot;the mulberries,&quot; 
                    in Spanish&#151;probably attracted travelers for thousands 
                    of years. By the late 1700s, the site was a stop on the eastern 
                    branch of the Comanche trail from the southern High Plains 
                    into Mexico. Perhaps because of the exposure to Indian raiders, 
                    no Spanish or Mexican settlement took hold there. </p>
                  <p class="text">Between 1830 and 1833, an English-born physician 
                    named John Charles Beales secured about 50 million acres worth 
                    of <em>empresario</em> contracts to settle 1,450 colonists on 
                    lands north of the Rio Grande. Under the auspices of the Rio 
                    Grande and Texas Land Company, Beales in 1833 began settling 
                    Mexican and immigrant American, English, and German colonists 
                    on the banks of Las Moras Creek a few miles downstream from 
                    the springs. The settlement, named &quot;Dolores,&quot; clung 
                    to the poor soil for three years despite harsh climate and 
                    Indian raids. </p>
                  <p class="text">The beginning of the Texan revolt against Mexico 
                    and the approach of Santa Anna's troops finally scattered 
                    the settlers in 1836. One large wagon train en route to Matamoros 
                    was attacked by Indians, and the colonists were massacred. 
                    The village of Dolores was never reoccupied, although its 
                    remnants became a rendezvous point for traders, trappers, 
                    and other frontiersmen.</p>
                  <p class="text">The first significant party of Anglo-Americans 
                    to pass this way was led by U.S. Army lieutenants W.H.C. Whiting 
                    and William F. Smith, returning to San Antonio after an expedition 
                    to El Paso in 1849. Within a few months, a larger expedition 
                    followed. Colonel Joseph E. Johnston, the army's senior topographical 
                    engineer in Texas, was directed to mark a road westward from 
                    San Antonio to El Paso, generally along the Whiting-Smith 
                    route . Johnston was attached to a party of six companies 
                    of the 3rd Infantry under Major Jefferson Van Horne. The expedition 
                    included 275 wagons, 2,500 head of livestock, and a group 
                    of emigrants on their way to California. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1852, the Army established a new chain of 
                    forts to guard the western frontier of Texas settlements. 
                    Major Joseph La Motte and two companies of the 1st Infantry 
                    bivouacked at Las Moras Springs in June and named their camp 
                    &quot;Fort Riley.&quot; In July, the government leased the 
                    land from San Antonio businessman Samuel Maverick for a term 
                    of 20 years. That same month, the new post was named &quot;Fort 
                    Clark,&quot; in honor of Major John B. Clark of the 1st Infantry 
                    who had died in the Mexican War.</p>
                  <p class="text">The first temporary buildings constructed were 
                    an adjutant's office, a bakery, and a guardhouse. The post 
                    was inspected in 1853 by Colonel W. G. Freeman, who reported 
                    that the troops were at work constructing quarters for themselves. 
                    By the end of 1857, they had added a headquarters building, 
                    hospital, and permanent bakery. </p>

              early years. The stakes, set when still green, dried in the summer's 
              heat and separated from the floor, so that &quot;rats and mice came 
              and went without ceremony,&quot; according to a Mrs. Lydia Spencer 
              Lane, who lived with her husband, Lt. William Lane, in a similar 
              structure at Fort Clark during the 1850s. &quot;The rats and mice 
              were bad, but we found a huge snake on the mantel-piece and that 
              was much worse. I was just about to retire one night, when we heard 
              a suspicious rustling among papers, and there he was, moving cautiously

                  <p class="text">Fort Clark sent more soldiers into battle in 
                    1856 than any other Texas post except Fort Mason, headquarters 
                    of the new 2nd Cavalry. Various units from Fort Clark, Fort 
                    Inge, and Fort McIntosh fought 10 more actions in 1857. The 
                    next year, the army shifted the 2nd Cavalry north to operate 
                    against Comanche and Kiowa camps in the Indian Territory. 
                    Infantry and artillery units were left at Fort Clark until 
                    the beginning of the Civil War; the Army abandoned the post 
                    in March, 1861. </p>
                  <p class="text">When the war ended, the presence of French occupation 
                    forces in Mexico once again drew the U.S. Army's attention 
                    to the lower Rio Grande. The 4th Cavalry reoccupied Fort Clark 
                    and Fort Inge in the fall of 1866, and almost immediately 
                    began confronting hostile Indians. When the 9th Cavalry replaced 
                    the 4th at Fort Clark in 1868, the post began its long association 
                    with the black troops of the U.S. Army. During the ensuing 
                    decade, companies of the 9th and 10th Cavalry, 24th Infantry, 
                    25th Infantry, and Seminole-Negro Indian scouts would be instrumental 
                    in most of the patrols and all of the major campaigns emanating 
                    from Fort Clark.</p>
                  <p class="text">The unit perhaps most closely associated with 
                    Fort Clark was known formally as the Detachment of Seminole-Negro 
                    Indian Scouts (also referred to today as the Black Seminole 
                    scouts). The Seminole Negroes have a complex 300-year history 
                    stretching from Florida to Oklahoma, Mexico, and Texas. In 
                    1870, a band recently arrived at Fort Duncan was mustered 
                    into army service by Major Zenas R. Bliss to serve as scouts 
                    for the 25th Infantry. They received a regular army private's 
                    pay, arms, ammunition, and rations. Their performance in the 
                    field drew the attention of Lieutenant Colonel Wesley Merritt, 
                    9th Cavalry, who succeeded in having a number of them transfer 
                    with their families to Fort Clark. There they came under the 
                    command of 24th Infantry Lieutenant John L. Bullis, who would 
                    lead the scout detachment for 10 years.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Seminole Negroes living in the vicinity 
                    of Fort Clark contributed to a rich ethnic mix for the nearby 
                    town of Brackett, whose population in 1870 was approximately 
                    one-third native Mexican. The town had been named for its 
                    first merchant, Oscar B. Brackett, who opened a dry goods 
                    store near Las Moras Creek when Fort Clark was established 
                    in 1852. It had a stop on the San Antonio-El Paso stage line, 
                    but the population remained small, only 61 persons in 1860. 
                    When the army returned after the Civil War, Brackett experienced 
                    a boom, and the population had reached 1,204 by 1870. </p>
                  <p class="text">The forts constructed on the Texas frontier 
                    in the antebellum period had fallen into disrepair during 
                    the Civil War, and those that were reoccupied in the late 
                    1860s required repair and renovation. Fort Clark also required 
                    expansion to accommodate the increasing numbers of soldiers 
                    garrisoned there. Additional quarters for officers and enlisted 
                    men were constructed, along with a new hospital, bakery, and 
                    &quot;meat house.&quot; Colonel Ranald Mackenzie was the first 
                    occupant of the new commanding officer's quarters constructed 
                    in 1874.</p>

                  <p class="text">Mackenzie was a favorite of General Philip H. 
                    Sheridan, who as commander of the army's Military Division 
                    of the Missouri directed all major military affairs on the 
                    Plains. Mackenzie was offered one of the few post-war commands 
                    open to an officer so young, that of the 41st Infantry. He 
                    accepted the command and a colonel's rank, but in 1870 transferred 
                    to a more prestigious assignment&#151;command of the 4th Cavalry. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">By 1873, the 4th was known as one of the army's 
                    hardest-riding outfits, having followed Mackenzie on three 
                    expeditions from Fort Richardson in north Texas to the Staked 
                    Plains of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. When cross-border 
                    raids into southern Texas by Lipan and Kickapoo became intolerable, 
                    Sheridan ordered Mackenzie and his regiment to Fort Clark, 
                    with directions to conduct a campaign of &quot;annihilation, 
                    obliteration, and complete destruction,&quot; according to 
                    his regimental adjutant. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mackenzie departed the vicinity of Fort Clark 
                    before dawn on May 17, 1873, and crossed the Rio Grande that 
                    night with six companies of the 4th Cavalry and Bullis's Seminole-Negro 
                    Indian scouts. Their target was a group of Lipan and Kickapoo 
                    villages near Remolino, Mexico. Early the next morning, the 
                    soldiers attacked and destroyed three villages, killed 19 
                    Indians, and captured an aging Lipan chief and 40 women and 
                    children. One soldier was killed and two were wounded. Some 
                    160 miles and 32 hours after leaving Fort Clark, the troopers 
                    returned with the captives and 65 horses. </p>
                  <p class="text">A year later, Mackenzie was given command of 
                    the southern column of the campaign against Comanche, Kiowa, 
                    and Cheyenne that became known as the &quot;Red River War.&quot; 
                    Private Adam Paine, one of 13 Seminole-Negro Indian scouts 
                    accompanying the expedition, would become the first of four 
                    of the scouts to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
                    The others, Sergeant John Ward and privates Pompey Factor 
                    and Isaac Payne, were recognized for saving Bullis's life 
                    in an action against a superior force of Indians at the Eagle's 
                    Nest Crossing of the Pecos River in 1875.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the end of 1875, the two cavalry regiments 
                    most associated with Fort Clark in the post-Civil War era&#151;the 
                    4th Cavalry and the 9th Cavalry&#151;were transferred out 
                    of Texas. The 8th Cavalry took the place of the 9th on the 
                    border. The 10th Cavalry took the former place of the 4th 
                    on the northern frontier and the Edwards Plateau. Both would

                  <p class="text">Lieutenant Colonel William R. &quot;Pecos Bill&quot; 
                    Shafter had been Mackenzie's second in command in the old 
                    41st Infantry, later reorganized as the 24th Infantry. He 
                    had been transferred from Fort Duncan to Fort Concho in 1875 
                    to lead the 10th Cavalry in a sweep of the Staked Plains in 
                    which Bullis and his Seminole-Negro Indian scouts played a 
                    prominent role. He returned to the border in 1876 to lead 
                    the army's efforts against Lipan and Mescalero Apaches raiding 
                    Texas from villages in Mexico. </p>
                  <p class="text">Shafter was authorized to send his soldiers 
                    across the border when in &quot;hot&quot; pursuit of Indian 
                    raiders. Operating out of Fort Clark and Fort Duncan, companies 
                    of the 8th Cavalry, 10th Cavalry, and the Seminole-Negro Indian 
                    scouts attacked camps of Kickapoo and Lipan and Mescalero 
                    Apaches in Mexico four times in 1876 and 1877. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mackenzie returned to Fort Clark in 1878 to 
                    combine with Shafter for a show of force south of the border&#151;more 
                    than 1,000 men comprising the 4th Cavalry, 24th and 25th Infantry, 
                    Bullis's scouts, three batteries of artillery, and a supply 
                    train of 40 wagons. The display humiliated the Mexican army, 
                    enraged the Mexican government, and seemed to prompt a series 
                    of aggressive campaigns by General Geronimo Trevino to pacify 
                    the Indians and bandits on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The next year, Mackenzie and the 4th were again 
                    summoned for a special assignment, this time to help put down 
                    a Ute Indian uprising in Colorado. There would be no more 
                    cavalry campaigns against Indians conducted from Fort Clark. 
                    There would, however, be one more action for the Seminole-Negro 
                    Indian scouts.</p>
                  <p class="text">In April, 1881, a band of Lipans attacked the 
                    McLauren cabin at Buzzard's Roost in the canyon of the Frio 
                    River, killing John McLauren's wife Kate and a teen-aged boy 
                    who was living with the couple. Lieutenant Bullis received 
                    a &quot;pursue and destroy&quot; order at Fort Clark 12 days 
                    later. Bullis and 30 scouts picked up the Indians' trail and 
                    tracked them for six days, crossing the Rio Grande above the 
                    Pecos River and following into the Sierra del Burro Mountains. 
                    There, in a dawn attack on May 3, the scouts killed four Indians 
                    and captured a woman, a child, and 21 horses. A Lipan sub-chief 
                    was later reported to have been found dead of wounds received 
                    in the battle. </p>
                  <p class="text">It was the last action fought against Indians 
                    by U.S. Army forces stationed in Texas.</p><br>
