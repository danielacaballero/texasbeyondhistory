      <p>&quot;Texan settlers pursuing Indians.&quot; New York Illustrated News, 
        March 13, 1861. Partial text of newspaper account accompanying the picture 
        reads: &quot;The trouble between the settlers and the Indians in Texas 
        continue with unabated virulence. Our sketch represents the former pursuing 
        the latter, after they had made a series of murderous onslaughts upon 
        the settlers in the interior. A corresondent, writing from Roma, says: 
        So far as heard from, fifteen Mexicans and one American have been killed 
        by the Indians, besides several Mexican boys and women captured. Several 
        parties are in pursuit, and we are beginning to receive good reports from 
        them. A wounded man came to Mier yesterday, and reported that Jesus Garcia 
        Ramirez and a party from Laredo, under command of Benavides, numbering 
        in all about sixty men, attacked a party of the Indians while they were 
        resting at a place called the Salado, and killed four of them, taking 
        two Mexican captive boys, and all the horses....&quot; Engraving and document
