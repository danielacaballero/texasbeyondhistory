                  <p class="text">The U.S. Army's forts on the northwestern frontier 
                    of Texas were bound tightly to the ebb and flow of warfare 
                    with the Plains Indians. As each post outlived its purpose 
                    and was abandoned, civilians who had congregated nearby faced 
                    an uncertain future. Fort Griffin in its heyday spawned one 
                    of the liveliest and most notorious settlements in the West. 
                    The fort was the longest continuously-occupied post in the 
                    region, but the town that took its name barely survived the 
                    Army's departure in 1881. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The post that became Fort Griffin was established 
                    in the summer of 1867 by companies of the 6th Cavalry. The 
                    original site was in the bottoms of the Clear Fork of the 
                    Brazos River, a few miles downstream from the 1850s site of 
                    Camp Cooper. It was originally named Camp Wilson, for a recently 
                    deceased 6th Cavalry lieutenant, Henry Wilson. In 1868, it 
                    was renamed Fort Griffin, in honor of Colonel Charles Griffin, 
                    the departmental commandant who had himself recently died. 
                    More than just a name change was involved, however, as the 
                    post was moved away from the unhealthful bottoms to an adjacent 
                    plateau. </p>
                  <p class="text">In later years, the location would be called 
                    &quot;Government Hill&quot; by some local residents. To the 
                    west, Collins Creek flowed around the base of the hill into 
                    the Clear Fork, and the creek served as the fort's water source 
                    for a time. A stronger stream east of the plateau furnished 
                    a location for a sawmill, and would be named &quot;Mill Creek.&quot; 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The scant architectural remains of both the 
                    fort and town belie the brief, but significant, life of each. 
                    The fort's bakery and powder magazine have been restored, 
                    and partial walls of the administration building and sutler's 
                    (post trader's) store still stand, along with a chimney from 
                    one of the officers' quarters. Foundations of numerous other 
                    buildings are visible on the grounds. Reconstructed frame 
                    buildings represent the size and style of enlisted quarters 
                    and mess.</p>
                  <p class="text">Even less remains of the town below the hill, 
                    known primarily as &quot;The Flat,&quot; but also as &quot;Buffalo 
                    Town, &quot;Fort Griffin,&quot; and, simply, &quot;Griffin.&quot; 
                    The townsite is on private property, but is accessible by 
                    county roads. Its sole surviving building is its first all-stone 
                    structure, the Masonic lodge and school house, built in 1878 
                    and restored by the current owner. Foundations of other buildings 
                    are visible, and a number of them flank the current county 
                    road running from the base of Government Hill to the place 
                    where the old Fort Richardson road crossed the Clear Fork. 
                    This road was &quot;Griffin Avenue,&quot; the main street 
                    of the town, in the late 1870s. </p>
                  <p class="text">As a military establishment, Fort Griffin was 
                    something of an afterthought of the Army throughout the life 
                    of the post. Plans for substantial permanent structures were 
                    drawn and approved, but most were never consummated. The Army 
                    had to request funds from the U.S. Congress for building materials, 
                    transportation, and skilled labor for each of its significant 
                    construction projects. In the meantime, temporary quarters 
                    were built from whatever local materials could be obtained, 
                    by enlisted personnel with whatever time and skills were available 
                    among them.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Army high command never could quite get 
                    around to Fort Griffin, so local commanders made do with what 
                    they could cobble together. For the most part, that was &quot;rawhide&quot; 
                    lumber&#151;so named because of its similarity to untanned, 
                    or &quot;green,&quot; cattle and buffalo hides&#151;milled 
                    at the nearby stream and fashioned into barracks and other 
                    buildings by whatever infantry companies were not on campaign. 
                    Foundations were chiseled from local limestone, possibly quarried 
                    from the base of the hill or hauled from nearby streambeds.</p>
                  <p class="text">But the rawhide lumber shrank and warped as 
                    it dried, so that the wood was little better than mesquite 
                    brush as a defense against wind and rain. A favored alternative 
                    was &quot;picket&quot; construction&#151;straight oak, pecan, 
                    and elm trunks and limbs set on end in shallow trenches and 
                    chinked with cattails, brush, rock, and mud. The alternative 
                    for many enlisted personnel was long-term use of the Army's 
                    short-term shelter, the canvas tent.</p>

                  <p class="text">Throughout the late 1860s, the Army leadership 
                    was marking time in Texas, waiting for the government to sort 
                    out its relationship with the Plains Indians while it occupied 
                    itself primarily with Reconstruction duties in the interior 
                    of the state. Conditions on the frontier&#151;among the soldiers 
                    as well as the settlers&#151;suffered from an absence of a 
                    definitive military strategy. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Army's attitude changed in 1871, but conditions 
                    at Fort Griffin did not. William T. Sherman, commanding general 
                    of the Army, and Randolph B. Marcy, inspector general, passed 
                    through Fort Griffin on an inspection tour of the frontier 
                    posts. Sherman&#151;who was making his first trip to the region&#151;was 
                    skeptical of the need for a strong military presence on the 
                    frontier, believing that the outcry by Texas politicians was 
                    motivated by a desire to divert the Army's attention from 
                    its Reconstruction duties. Marcy saw instead how severely 
                    the civilian settlements had been depopulated since his last 
                    visit in the 1850s. Neither, however, was favorably impressed 
                    with Fort Griffin.</p>
                  <p class="text">Impressive or not, the post would soon become 
                    a major base for the campaigns that would finish the Comanche 
                    and Kiowa as a threat to settlements on the northwestern frontier. 
                    Sherman and Marcy narrowly escaped a Kiowa ambush as they 
                    traveled from Fort Griffin to Fort Richardson. Jolted out 
                    of his skepticism, Sherman ordered Colonel Ranald Mackenzie, 
                    commanding the 4th Cavalry at Fort Richardson, into action.</p>
                  <p class="text">Mackenzie had only recently taken command of 
                    the regiment, and had moved its headquarters from Fort Concho 
                    to Fort Richardson. Raids on the northwestern frontier were 
                    believed to be conducted by Comanche and Kiowa from the Fort 
                    Sill reservation in the Indian Territory, and Fort Richardson 
                    was the post best-positioned between the reservation and the 
                    hard-hit white settlements. But non-reservation Comanche were 
                    suspect also, and they inhabited the Llano Estacado, well 
                    to the west.</p>
                  <p class="text">Fort Griffin, farther west than Fort Richardson, 
                    was used as a rendezvous point and supply base for Mackenzie's 
                    troopers during the campaigns of 1871-1872. The 4th Cavalry's 
                    route from the Clear Fork to the High Plains became known 
                    to later travelers as the &quot;Mackenzie Trail.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">These were long-range expeditions, leaving from 
                    established posts with heavy supply columns, guided by reliable 
                    Tonkawa scouts into uncharted territory. The first, departing 
                    in August, 1871, resulted in no engagements. The second lasted 
                    from late September to early November, and started ignominiously 
                    with Quanah's Quahadis capturing 66 of Mackenzie's horses 
                    while the cavalry was encamped. Two additional engagements 
                    resulted in light casualties, including the wounding of Mackenzie 
                    in a fight at Blanco Canyon near the headwaters of the Brazos.</p>
                  <p class="text">Mackenzie's third campaign prompted a definitive 
                    engagement in late September, 1872, in which soldiers of the 
                    4th Cavalry and 24th Infantry, guided again by Tonkawa scouts, 
                    attacked a Kotsoteka and Quahadi village of 175 lodges on 
                    the North Fork of the Red River. The soldiers captured more 
                    than 100 Indian women and children, and a herd of about 800 
                    horses. The Comanches recaptured most of the horses by the 
                    next day, but Mackenzie took the prisoners to Fort Concho, 
                    from which they later were transferred to Fort Sill.</p>

                    Mackenzie's campaigns also mapped the bison range from Fort 
                    Griffin into eastern New Mexico. Bison&#151;or buffalo&#151;hides 
                    had been a popular trade item on the fringes of the Plains 
                    for centuries, but they became big business in the early 1870s 
                    after industrial uses for them were discovered by New England 
                    manufacturers. By 1874, hunters were swarming onto the plains 
                    from Dodge City and the town of Fort Griffin, which began 
                    to boom as a hunter supply and buffalo hide shipment point.

                    (see TBH's <a href="../../redriver/index.html" class="text">Red

                    with the climactic engagement at Palo Duro Canyon in late 
                    September, 1874 . But the fight at Palo Duro was not the end 
                    of the campaign, and units based at Fort Griffin contributed 
                    materially to its outcome. Lieutenant Colonel George Buell, 
                    commanding Fort Griffin, led an expedition of 9th Cavalry, 
                    11th Infantry, and Tonkawa scouts that attacked and scattered 
                    Kiowa villagers near the Canadian River in the Indian Territory 
                    in a mop-up expedition known as the &quot;Wrinkled Hand Chase&quot; 
                    because it was conducted in an unusually wet fall and winter.

                  <p class="text"> The last military engagement involving troops 
                    from Fort Griffin occurred on April 9, 1877. A band of Quahadi 
                    under a leader sometimes known as Black Horse left the Fort 
                    Sill reservation to hunt buffalo and to make war on white 
                    buffalo hunters. Among the camps attacked was that of Pat 
                    Garrett, later to be sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico, 
                    and killer of &quot;Billy the Kid.&quot; A company of 10th 
                    Cavalry &quot;buffalo soldiers&quot;&#151;black enlisted men 
                    commanded by white officers&#151;tracked the band to Lake 
                    Quemado in the Texas Panhandle, where a sharp fight resulted 
                    in the deaths of Sergeant Charles Baker and four Comanches. 
                    The soldiers captured 69 horses.</p>
                  <p class="text"> By that time, the slaughter of the southern 
                    buffalo herd was well under way. The Texas Plains were hunted 
                    out largely between 1874 and 1878. The hide business at Fort 
                    Griffin gave up its status as an economic engine with the 
                    advent of cattle trailing through the Clear Fork country.</p>
                  <p class="text">The region had been instrumental in the development 
                    of the Goodnight-Loving cattle trail, which sent cattle from 
                    the northern Texas frontier to the southwest along the old 
                    Butterfield stage route, then north along the Pecos River 
                    into Mexico and Colorado. That trail, and Chisholm Trail, 
                    which passed by Fort Worth on the way to Abilene and Wichita, 
                    Kansas, had been the preferred routes for sending Texas cattle 
                    to northern markets. The Western&#151;or &quot;Dodge City&quot;&#151; 
                    trail opened in 1875, and by the end of the 1870s had surpassed 
                    the Chisholm Trail as the preferred route of drovers from 
                    south Texas. The Western Trail passed near Fort Griffin, and 
                    the town became the last important supply point on the route 
                    to Kansas and points north. </p>
                  <p class="text">&quot;Cow town,&quot; &quot;hidetown,&quot; 
                    &quot;scabtown&quot;&#151;the village on &quot;The Flat&quot; 
                    between Fort Griffin and the Clear Fork became a frontier 
                    boom town of hunters, cow men, a village of Tonkawa Indians 
                    who served the Army as scouts, and a variety of merchants 
                    and predators. But, like many such towns, it could not sustain 
                    itself after the boom. Local ranchers began to avoid the rowdy 
                    village, and nearby Albany won the contest to be the seat 
                    of government for Shackelford County. The town of Fort Griffin 
                    would begin to wither away after the Army left and the closest 
                    railroad spur stopped at Albany. </p>
                  <p class="text"> With the Comanche and Kiowa confined to the 
                    Fort Sill reservation, the purpose of the northwestern frontier 
                    posts was accomplished. Fort Richardson was abandoned in 1878. 
                    Fort Griffin had been periodically recommended for abandonment 
                    since 1873, and departmental commander Christopher Auger had 
                    characterized the post as &quot;unfit for human habitation.&quot; 
                    The Army had invested comparatively little in Fort Griffin, 
                    and in the performance of its mission it had been a bargain. 
                    It concluded its service on May 31, 1881, when the last remaining 
                    infantry company lowered the nation's flag and marched away.</p>
