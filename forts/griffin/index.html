      <p class="text">The settlers of the Peters Colony arrived on the grassy 
        plains of north Texas in the 1840s expecting to raise crops and domestic 
        livestock and to build towns. But the advertisements that had drawn them 
        from their homes along the Ohio River valleys had not disclosed the claims 
        to this country that were held by Comanche and Kiowa Indians. The colonists 
        encroached on the fringes of the historic bison range, and the resulting 
        conflict was predictable. Intertribal warfare had driven Apache and Tonkawa 
        peoples from these hunting grounds. Officials of the Republic of Texas 
        had used force to open the region to white settlement, but had not removed 
        the Plains Indians from striking distance. A succession of United States 
        Army posts would be established across northwestern Texas as government 
        policy and military doctrine lurched toward a solution to the problem 
        of frontier defense.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="text"> When the United States Army returned to Texas after the 
        Civil War, Fort Griffin was one of the posts constructed to protect the 
        northwestern frontier of white settlement from Comanche and Kiowa raids. 
        The fort was the operations base for several army expeditions across the 
        Plains, and the nearby boom town known as &quot;The Flat&quot; bustled 
        with the raucous activity of buffalo hunters, cattle drovers, outlaws 
        , and gamblers. Legendary characters&#151;from Doc Holiday and Wyatt Earp 
        to John Wesley Hardin&#151;played a part in honing the town's reputation 
        as &quot;Babylon on the Brazos.&quot; Famed warriors, from Ranald Mackenzie 
        to Quanah Parker and Kicking Bird, fought over who would ultimately claim 
        the vast prairie lands. </p>
