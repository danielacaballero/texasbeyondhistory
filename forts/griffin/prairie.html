                    the traveler also upon the more substantial evidence of a 
                    30-year struggle over this country. Forts Belknap and Phantom 
                    Hill, along with Camp Cooper, represent the U.S. Army's attempts, 
                    first, to shield white settlements from Indian raids, then 
                    to contain hostile bands on Texas reservations. Forts Richardson 
                    and Griffin are testaments to the army's ultimate solution 
                    to the problem of Indian-white relations on the northwestern 
                    Texas frontier.<br>
                    <br>
                    This country had comprised the easternmost portion of the 
                    southern Plains bison range. In prehistoric times, it had 
                    been something of a crossroads for plains and woodland peoples, 
                    and in the early 1800s Comanche, Wichita, and Caddo could 
                    be encountered there. By mid-century, a number of Comanche 
                    bands were prominent in the area.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Nokoni plied the region between the Brazos 
                    River and the Red. Their chief, usually called Peta Nocona 
                    by Anglo-Texans, took the white captive Cynthia Ann Parker 
                    as his wife. The band was among the most nomadic of the Comanche, 
                    and after Peta's death they became known as &quot;The Wanderers.&quot; 
                    They may have been related to the band least known to the 
                    whites, the Quahadi, whose home range lay to the west, high 
                    on the plains of the Llano Estacado. The last war leader of 
                    the Quahadi would be Quanah&#151;memorialized in Texas history 
                    as Quanah Parker, the son of Peta Nocona and Cynthia Ann Parker. 
                    Quanah's band would be the last of the Comanche to submit 
                    to white dominion.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Farther north were the lands of the Kotsoteka 
                    band, who preferred the lands drained by the Canadian River. 
                    Farther still were the Yamparika, whose villages usually lay 
                    between the Canadian River and the Arkansas in the southwestern 
                    quarter of modern Kansas.</p>
                  <p class="text"> By the early 1800s, the Comanche had formed 
                    a strong alliance with the Kiowa, with whom they shared the 
                    bison range. Although numerically weaker than the aggregate 
                    of the Comanche bands, the Kiowa were somewhat more cohesive 
                    and even more fierce and brutal raiders.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Fingers of white settlement crept up the Trinity 
                    and Brazos rivers toward this country in the early 1840s. 
                    In 1841 Edward H. Tarrant led a company of militia against 
                    settlements of Caddo, Cherokee and Tonkawa along a tributary 
                    of the upper Trinity River known as Village Creek. The badly 
                    outnumbered attackers withdrew after inflicting and receiving 
                    light casualties, but when Tarrant and a larger force returned 
                    a few months later, the villages had been abandoned.</p>
                  <p class="text"> In that year, the land-rich but cash-poor Republic 
                    of Texas authorized a number of empresario arrangements to 
                    increase immigration. One of the recipients of the new land 
                    grants was William S. Peters, who initially contracted to 
                    settle 200 families in an area drained by the upper Trinity. 
                    Additional contracts expanded the size of the grant to an 
                    enormous block of territory running from the Red River to 
                    southeast of modern Dallas, then west nearly to modern Abilene, 
                    then north to the Red River again.</p>
                  <p class="text"> As white settlement moved onto the prairies 
                    after the end of the Mexican War, the northwestern frontier 
                    of Texas was especially vulnerable to the northern Comanche 
                    and Kiowa bands. With the war concluded, the army was charged 
                    with protecting a vast expanse of new territory, and Texas 
                    politicians were agitating for a defensive screen between 
                    the white settlements and Comancher&iacute;a&#151;the Spanish-Mexican 
                    term for the Comanche range. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1849, a company of the U.S. Army's 2nd Dragoons 
                    established a post on the West Fork of the Trinity River. 
                    It was named Fort Worth, in honor of Brevet Major General 
                    William Jenkins Worth, commander of the 8th Military Department 
                    (later, the Department of Texas). Until its abandonment in 
                    1853, Fort Worth was a link in a chain of forts that included 
                    Fort Graham and Fort Gates in the northern prairie region, 
                    and extended south to the Alsatian and German immigrant settlements 
                    west of San Antonio.</p>
                  <p class="text">The concept of the 1849 line was fatally flawed. 
                    The posts were too close to the settlements and manned primarily 
                    by infantry who lacked the ability to intercept incoming Comanche 
                    and Kiowa raiders or to effectively pursue them. The army's 
                    answer to this problem was a new defensive line, this one 
                    well in advance of the westernmost settlements. Army Captain 
                    Randolph B. Marcy had been dispatched to determine a direct 
                    military route from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Santa Fe in 1849. 
                    His return route crossed the prairie-plains of western Texas, 
                    and in 1851 that route inspired a new chain of frontier forts.</p>
                  <p class="text">The northernmost of these was Fort Belknap, 
                    about 80 miles northwest of Fort Worth on the Brazos River. 
                    Roughly 80 miles southwest of Belknap&#151;just north of modern 
                    Abilene&#151;was a post on the Clear Fork of the Brazos, known 
                    unofficially as Fort Phantom Hill. About the same distance 
                    further to the southwest, Fort Chadbourne was established 
                    on a tributary of the Colorado River. </p>

                  <p class="text">None of these posts&#151;those of the new &quot;second 
                    line&quot; any more than those of the earlier &quot;first 
                    line&quot;&#151;inconvenienced the Comanche and the Kiowa 
                    in the slightest degree. During the years 1848-1855, only 
                    two engagements with Indians were fought by troops from any 
                    of these posts. One of those was an Indian attack on soldiers 
                    at Fort Chadbourne. Phantom Hill, with poor wood and worse 
                    water, was soon abandoned by the army. Fort Belknap was relegated 
                    to guarding the reservations the state had established for 
                    some of its Indians. </p>
                  <p class="text">After years of prodding by U.S. officials, the 
                    Texas legislature in 1854 authorized the creation of two reservations, 
                    one on the Brazos River below Fort Belknap, and the other, 
                    the &quot;Upper Reserve,&quot; on the Clear Fork. The Brazos 
                    Reservation housed some 1,000 Anadarko, Caddo,Tawakoni,Tonkawa, 
                    and Waco Indians. The Upper Reserve was able to attract only 
                    about 450 of the Penateka Comanche&#151;&quot;Honey Eaters&quot;&#151;who 
                    had ranged mostly south of the Brazos River. The job of the 
                    army was to keep these Indians on their reservations, and 
                    to keep white settlers away from them.</p>
                  <p class="text">The forts in the region soon took on a new role, 
                    however. The arrival of the army's 2nd Cavalry late in 1855 
                    presaged a dramatic change in military strategy. Its commanding 
                    officer was Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston, a veteran of several 
                    Indian campaigns and a former secretary of war of the Republic 
                    of Texas. Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee was second in command. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The companies of the 2nd Cavalry were dispersed 
                    along a line that mimicked the &quot;second line&quot; of 
                    forts, but generally placed the horse soldiers closer to established 
                    settlements where grain for the regiment's animals was more 
                    available. Lee, who was effectively in command for much of 
                    the regiment's tour in Texas, took station at Camp Cooper, 
                    established in 1856 on the Clear Fork near the heart of the 
                    Upper Reserve. Most of the &quot;second line&quot; forts then 
                    became bivouac, rendezvous, and supply points for the wide-ranging 
                    troopers as they scouted for Indian trails, intercepting and 
                    pursuing the raiders they could find. </p>
                  <p class="text">Another strategic change was a policy of striking 
                    the non-reservation Indians where they lived-in the Indian 
                    Territory north of the Red River. The most ambitious of these 
                    campaigns followed a Texas ranger model. In the spring of 
                    1858, veteran Indian fighter John S. &quot;Rip&quot; Ford 
                    received a gubernatorial appointment as &quot;senior captain 
                    commanding Texas frontier.&quot; With a hundred or so rangers, 
                    and about an equal number of Brazos reservation Indians led 
                    by agent Shapley Ross, Ford struck the Canadian River camp 
                    of the Kotsoteka chief Iron Jacket in the Antelope Hills of 
                    the Indian Territory. Iron Jacket and 75 other Comanche were 
                    killed by the combined attack force, which lost two killed 
                    and three wounded. An additional 18 Indians were captured, 
                    mostly women and children, as well as about 300 horses. The 
                    village and its contents were destroyed.</p>
                  <p class="text">Four months after Ford's return, a force of 
                    2nd Cavalry under senior Captain Earl Van Dorn moved into 
                    the Indian Territory with a detachment of the 1st Infantry 
                    and 60 Indian auxiliaries from the Brazos agency. The Indians 
                    were led by the agent's 20-year-old son, Lawrence S. &quot;Sul&quot; 
                    Ross. They spied a large number of Comanche-&#151;Buffalo 
                    Hump and his Penateka band&#151;camped near a Wichita village 
                    in the valley of Rush Creek. Van Dorn struck the Comanche 
                    camp at dawn. The fight lasted for more than an hour, and 
                    when the surviving Comanches fled, they left 56 warriors and 
                    two women dead on the field. Van Dorn lost one officer and 
                    four enlisted men killed. He, Ross, and nine enlisted men 
                    were seriously wounded.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the Spring of 1859, Van Dorn again led a 
                    force beyond the Red River, this time attacking a Kotsoteka 
                    village on Crooked Creek, in modern Kansas. Two enlisted men 
                    died and 10 were wounded, along with two officers and two 
                    Indian scouts. None of the Comanches escaped; 50 were killed, 
                    50 were wounded, and 37 (32 of them women) were captured.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The army's aggressiveness did not stop Comanches 
                    from raiding in Texas, nor their Kiowa allies. But on the 
                    eve of the Civil War, the army and Texas rangers were trading 
                    the Indians blow for blow. In mid-December of 1860, a company 
                    of rangers under &quot;Sul&quot; Ross combined with a detachment 
                    of the 2nd Cavalry to attack a Comanche camp on the Pease 
                    River. The captured villagers included Cynthia Ann Parker 
                    and her daughter. Ross reported that Peta Nocona was among 
                    the 14 Comanche dead. Although his son, Quanah, later disputed 
                    that assertion, evidence suggests that Peta died at or about 
                    that time, perhaps from wounds received in that battle.</p>
                  <p class="text"> One of the last large undertakings of the 2nd 
                    Cavalry was to assist in the removal of the Texas reservation 
                    Indians to the Indian Territory. Almost from the beginning, 
                    white settlers had coveted the reservation lands. Raids by 
                    northern Comanche and Kiowa, as well as white thievery, were 
                    blamed on the reservation Indians. The bands living on the 
                    Brazos Reserve&#151;the Tonkawa especially&#151;were doubly 
                    wronged, as they probably were innocent of most charges and 
                    had served as valued scouts and warriors with the rangers 
                    and the army.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Attacks on the reservation Indians increased 
                    nonetheless, and in 1859 agent Robert Neighbors succeeded 
                    in obtaining new lands for them north of the Red River. The 
                    2nd Cavalry's Major George Thomas led an army escort that 
                    accompanied the Indians on their journey. Texas authorities 
                    were so anxious to have the Indians gone that, in the abruptness 
                    of their departure, they were forced to leave most of their 
                    possessions behind. It would not be the last time the Tonkawa 
                    were so rewarded for their fealty to Texans.<br>

                    Secession and the Civil War threw frontier settlers back onto 
                    their own resources and methods. The state's efforts&#151;establishment 
                    of the Frontier Regiment of full-time soldiers and, later, 
                    the militia-style Frontier Organization&#151;were significant, 
                    but they were not nearly enough to protect the settlers from 
                    the newly emboldened Indian raiders. At war's end, settlement 
                    clung tenuously to the outlying counties. With state-financed 
                    defenses prohibited during the Reconstruction period, the 
                    frontier began to depopulate and dissolve.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The October, 1864, Elm Creek Raid in Young 
                    County was typical of the trauma of those years. A force of 
                    Kiowa and Comanche estimated at 700 warriors struck a string 
                    of farmsteads along Elm Creek near its confluence with the 
                    Brazos River above Fort Belknap . Eleven settlers&#151;men, 
                    women, and children, black and white&#151;were killed, and 
                    seven women and children, including the wife and two of the 
                    children of black frontiersman Britton Johnson, were carried 
                    away. Eleven houses were sacked or burned. The raiders eluded 
                    pursuit and returned to the Indian Territory.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Johnson would make four trips into the Comancheria 
                    to recover what remained of his family (the Indians had killed 
                    his oldest son during the raid). All the white captives but 
                    one also would be returned. Other frontier folk would not 
                    be so courageous, skillful, resolute, or lucky as Johnson. 
                    A compilation of reports from several&#151;but not all&#151;frontier 
                    counties showed 163 settlers killed by Indians, 24 wounded, 
                    and 43 carried off from the summer of 1865 through the summer 
                    of 1867.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Although returning to Texas en masse in mid-1865, 
                    the U.S. Army was slow to either recognize or respond to the 
                    frontier situation. Mounted troops did not return to the upper 
                    Brazos area until 1866, with modest detachments of the 6th 
                    Cavalry posted at civilian settlements at Jacksboro, Weatherford, 
                    and Waco. </p>

                  <br><p class="text">A year later, the 6th Cavalry established Fort 
                    Griffin (originally known as Camp Wilson) on the Clear Fork 
                    of the Brazos, downstream from old Camp Cooper and the site 
                    of the former Comanche reservation. The Jacksboro post was 
                    named Fort Richardson in 1868. The forts were first garrisoned 
                    primarily by the 6th Cavalry. Infantry companies were added 
                    in 1869, and companies of the 4th Cavalry arrived at both 
                    posts in 1870. </p>
                  <p class="text">The 6th Cavalry did not distinguish itself during 
                    its Texas tour of duty, although it fought more than 20 engagements 
                    in five years. In 1870, a 60-man command attacked the Kiowa 
                    camp of Kicking Bird, quickly found itself outnumbered and 
                    outflanked, and was forced into a six-hour fighting retreat. 
                    The army awarded 18 Congressional Medals of Honor for this 
                    action. One historian has, nonetheless, described the regiment's 
                    performance in Texas as &quot;lethargic.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text"><br>
                    Unlike the free rein given to the 2nd Cavalry before the Civil 
                    War, the post-war Army was constrained to some degree by the 
                    Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 and President U.S. Grant's so-called 
                    &quot;Peace Policy.&quot; The treaty called for the Comanche 
                    and Kiowa to go onto a combined reservation at the southwestern 
                    corner of the Indian Territory, just north of the Red River. 
                    The U.S. government was to provide them rations and other 
                    essentials, and they were to leave the reservation only to 
                    hunt buffalo. The army had authority to enforce this policy, 
                    but only against the chiefs that had signed the treaty, and 
                    even then only to the extent of rounding up and returning 
                    the bands caught off the reservation.</p>
                  <p class="text"><br>
                    The situation changed dramatically in 1871. As the raids against 
                    Texas settlements continued unabated, Texas politicians complained 
                    to the Grant administration. No traveler on the northwestern 
                    prairie was safe. In January, about 25 Kiowa ambushed Britton 
                    Johnson and three other black freighters. Teamsters who found 
                    their mutilated bodies reported 173 spent rifle shells at 
                    the spot where Britt Johnson's skill, resolve, and courage 
                    finally were not enough. </p>
                  <p class="text">William T. Sherman, commanding general of the 
                    army, embarked on a tour of inspection across the Texas frontier 
                    in the spring, on the new &quot;line&quot; of forts&#151;McKavett 
                    and Concho on the Edwards Plateau, Griffin and Richardson 
                    on the northern prairie. He traveled through Young County 
                    with a light escort, although 14 settlers had been reported 
                    killed there since January. He was accompanied by Colonel 
                    Randolph Marcy who, on May 17, wrote in his journal that the 
                    prairie-plains country did not contain as many white settlers 
                    as it had when he was last there in 1853.</p>
                  <p class="text">The day after Marcy's entry, more than 100 Indians, 
                    mostly Kiowa led by Satanta, Satank, and Big Tree, let Sherman's 
                    entourage pass the Little Salt Creek Prairie unmolested, then 
                    attacked a train of wagons owned by freighter Henry Warren. 
                    The wagon master and five teamsters were killed outright. 
                    A sixth was tortured to death. Five escaped. One of the escapees 
                    reached Fort Richardson and told the story to Sherman and 
                    Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, the new commander of the 4th 
                    Cavalry, headquartered at the post.</p>
                  <p class="text">Sherman sent Mackenzie in pursuit of the raiders, 
                    then continued on to Fort Sill, on the Comanche-Kiowa reservation, 
                    where Indian agent Lawrie Tatum expressed his concern that 
                    his charges had been marauding in Texas. Summoned by Tatum, 
                    Satanta boasted of his role in the Warren wagon train massacre. 
                    After a tense confrontation in which 10th Cavalry commander 
                    Benjamin Grierson saved Sherman from a Kiowa bullet, Satanta, 
                    Satank, and Big Tree were arrested. Mackenzie came in shortly 
                    thereafter to report that the Indians' trail had been lost 
                    in the rain near the Red River.</p>

                    result-both were sentenced to hang. Eastern &quot;peace politics&quot; 
                    intervened, however, and Reconstruction Governor Edmund J. 
                    Davis commuted the sentences to life imprisonment. Within 
                    two years, both Indians were paroled. </p>
                  <p class="text">But the significance of events on the Little 
                    Salt Creek Prairie&#151;&quot;the most dangerous prairie in 
                    Texas&quot;&#151;was that they were the beginning of the end 
                    of the Peace Policy. Sherman dispatched Mackenzie on a series 
                    of expeditions to the unmapped Llano Estacado. The Quahadi 
                    and Kotsoteka were harried from their camps and, more importantly, 
                    Mackenzie learned the Caprock's plains and canyons and Quanah's 
                    ways and wiles. That information would serve him well at the 
                    Palo Duro Canyon in 1874, the site of the climactic engagement 
                    of the campaign to be known as the Red River War.</p>
                  <p class="text">Mackenzie's expeditions did not take him into 
                    the Indian Territory, bust in all other meaningful respects 
                    they were replications of the 1858 and 1859 campaigns of &quot;Rip&quot; 
                    Ford and Earl Van Dorn. They involved primarily mounted troops, 
                    operating at long distance from fixed supply bases. They relied 
                    on Indian auxiliaries &#151;especially Tonkawa&#151;to scout 
                    the unfamiliar territory and find the Comanche camps. They 
                    killed few Indians, but they visited destruction and devastation 
                    on those camps, on the shelters, the supplies, the horse herds. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The result was that all of the Comanche and 
                    Kiowa bands were on the reservation by the end of 1875. Only 
                    sporadic fights between the soldiers of the U.S. army and 
                    the northern Indians occurred in Texas thereafter. The army 
                    abandoned Fort Richardson in 1878, Fort Griffin in 1881. </p>
