    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->A cornucopia of supplies 
      for living in the field. Typical officer's field pack contents, including 
      &quot;hard tack&quot; biscuits (usually 18 per day were issued), Army issue 
      hunting knife, &quot;mucket,&quot; and a cone of cane sugar, weighed 76 
      pounds when full. Other items include blanket, canteen, compass, binoculars, 
      small telescope, personal items (comb, shaving kit with mirror), Cavalry 
      Tactics manual, picket pin to tether a horse, saddle repair kit, rations 
      (such as grain) for the horse, horse tack, picket pin to thether horse, 
      gloves, pistol, ammunition, belt, canned goods, beans in a sack, tobacco 
      products, salted vinegar, and various other cooking condiments. Many items 
      served dual purposes: the mucket, a large tin mug, was also used to cook 
      in, the wide-bladed knife doubled as a shovel. The vinegar served to cover 
      the foul taste of non-refrigerated meat that might have spoiled. While picket 
      pins served the critical purpose of securing horses in treeless areas, they 
      could also be extremely hazardous. The heavy iron pin flying through the 
      air after horse was spooked resulted in a great many deaths for soldiers 
      on the frontier. All items from the John Cobb Collection, typically on display 
      at Fort McKavett during special events. Descriptive information, courtesy
