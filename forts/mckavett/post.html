                  <br><p class="text">Although it was falling into ruin by the mid-1800s, 
                    the abandoned Spanish presidio on the upper San Saba River 
                    occupied a prominent place in the strategies of American soldiers 
                    planning the defense of the Anglo-Texan frontier. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Albert Sidney Johnston, secretary of war of 
                    the Republic of Texas, had proposed placing a garrison at 
                    the &quot;old Spanish fort&quot; as part of his plan for a 
                    line of military posts running from the Red River to the Nueces. 
                    Texas never implemented Johnston's plan, but officers of the 
                    United States Army would later look favorably on the presidio's 
                    central location on the Edwards Plateau.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The end of the United States' war with Mexico 
                    in 1848 brought two issues of military strategy to convergence 
                    in the Hill Country. The first was the protection of the frontier 
                    settlements from raids by Comanche and Kiowa Indians. The 
                    second was the protection of westering travelers headed for 
                    the gold fields of California by way of El Paso.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The discovery of gold in California set off 
                    a flurry of exploration for transcontinental travel routes. 
                    Overland passage from St. Louis required crossing the uninhabited 
                    Great Plains&#151;or Great American Desert, as the region 
                    was denominated on maps of the time&#151;with their twin dangers 
                    of Indian attack and winter blizzards. The sea route, around 
                    the southern tip of South America, looked on paper to be even 
                    more time-consuming than it was in practice, and was expensive 
                    in any event. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Travel from New Orleans to Austin or San Antonio 
                    seemed easy enough. Passage from there, through El Paso to 
                    southern California, would be free of snow. The only thing 
                    lacking was development of a route that was safe from hostile 
                    Indians.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The veteran ranger and surveyor Jack Hays conducted 
                    an ill-fated exploration west from San Antonio in 1848 that 
                    was followed the next year by the more successful venture 
                    of Hays' fellow ranger, John S. &quot;Rip&quot; Ford, and 
                    U.S. Indian agent Robert Neighbors. Their effort began north 
                    of Austin and proceeded west, following the Concho River from 
                    its confluence with the Colorado, into the Trans-Pecos region, 
                    then west to El Paso. The Ford-Neighbors expedition returned 
                    by way of the Concho, San Saba, and Llano rivers, then through 
                    Fredericksburg and into San Antonio.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The U.S. Army was following the same train 
                    of thought, and almost the same schedule, as the civilian 
                    explorers. Departing San Antonio, lieutenants W.H.C. Whiting 
                    and William F. Smith traveled through Fredericksburg to the 
                    San Saba River, then west through the Trans-Pecos. When they 
                    returned, Whiting recommended locating a garrison of mounted 
                    troops at &quot;old Fort San Saba.&quot; In 1851, Brevet Major 
                    General Persifor Smith, commanding U.S. Army forces in Texas, 
                    ordered the construction of a post on the San Saba &quot;at 
                    the headsprings of that river near the El Paso road.&quot; 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"> Selection of an 8th Infantry headquarters on 
                    the San Saba proved unsatisfactory. The regiment arrived at 
                    the headwaters in March, 1852, and established camp as ordered. 
                    The site was on a small hill near a pond of &quot;permanent&quot; 
                    water. Although construction was begun on a lime kiln and 
                    bakery, the camp was soon moved two miles downstream when 
                    the pond became stagnant. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The new location was at first referred to as 
                    the &quot;Camp on the San Saba&quot; or &quot;Post on the 
                    San Saba.&quot; In October, it was renamed Camp McKavett&#151;and 
                    thereafter Fort McKavett&#151;in honor of Captain Henry McKavett 
                    of the 8th Infantry, who had served meritoriously in the Mexican 
                    War and been killed at Monterrey in 1846.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Five companies of the 8th Infantry initially 
                    were assigned to the post, and they set about constructing 
                    permanent buildings: five infantrymen's barracks, kitchens 
                    used temporarily as officers quarters, a hospital, and a quartermaster's 
                    storehouse. These were erected around a square parade ground. 
                    Each company was responsible for constructing its own quarters, 
                    and those of its officers.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Limestone was quarried nearby for building 
                    foundations and walls, and was burned&#151;probably in the 
                    kiln at the original location&#151;for mortar. Oak and pecan 
                    logs were used for construction of some buildings in the <em>jacal</em>, 
                    or picket, style. At first, there was no lumber for floors 
                    or doors, nor glass for windows. The required materials were 
                    transported from Fredericksburg in later years.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The post was improved substantially through 
                    the mid-1850s. The new construction included two-story quarters 
                    for the commanding officer and one-story barracks for other 
                    officers, adjutant's office, guardhouse, new bakery and kitchens, 
                    and laundresses' quarters.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Military operations at and around Fort McKavett 
                    reflected the evolution of the army's strategy of frontier 
                    defense in the 1850s. On an inspection tour in August, 1853, 
                    Colonel W. G. Freeman found Fort McKavett garrisoned by one 
                    company of mounted infantry&#151;46 men with only 30 serviceable 
                    horses, &quot;wretchedly equipped.&quot; The company's request 
                    for needed equipment had been properly rejected, said Colonel 
                    Freeman, because, &quot;it is now everywhere conceded that 
                    the experiment of mounting infantry has not been successful.&quot;</p>

                  <p class="text">The alternative was one of the army's regular 
                    mounted service units, either the dragoons or &quot;Mounted 
                    Rifles&quot;. Colonel Charles May, commanding the 2nd Dragoons, 
                    arrived at Fort McKavett in February, 1854. Within two months, 
                    departmental commander Persifor Smith ordered into the field 
                    all of the &quot;disposable force&quot; of dragoons at forts 
                    Chadbourne and McKavett and the Mounted Rifles at Fort Inge. 
                    Detachments of 15 men each were directed to patrol a line 
                    from the Nueces River to Fort Chadbourne. The contingent at 
                    Fort McKavett was assigned the stretch between the Concho 
                    River and the Llano. The only reported result of any of these 
                    patrols is a battle in the south Texas brush country involving 
                    troops from Fort Inge. </p>
                  <p class="text">The army's strategy and tactics became more 
                    aggressive, and more productive, in 1856. The newly arrived 
                    2nd Cavalry garrison at Fort Mason quickly became one of the 
                    most active in Texas. For two years, the 2nd's patrols hit 
                    parties of Comanche and Lipan wherever they could find them. 
                    In February, Sergeant Walter McDonald and a detachment of 
                    Company D from Camp Verde pursued Comanche raiders to Kickapoo 
                    Creek near the south fork of the Concho River. There, an attack 
                    left two soldiers and two Indians dead. The weary cavalrymen 
                    reached Fort McKavett after midnight, and there a wounded 
                    trooper by the name of John Martin died before dawn. The column 
                    left for Camp Verde at first light.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Penateka Comanche withdrew from the Hill 
                    Country in the late 1850s, to either the Clear Fork reservation 
                    or the Indian Territory beyond the Red River. Menard County 
                    was organized in 1858. With relative peace on the Edwards 
                    Plateau, Fort McKavett was ordered abandoned in February, 
                    1859. The post buildings were appropriated by civilian families 
                    living in the area.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Civil War years were a period of turmoil 
                    in the region, although this owed as much to the discord and 
                    violence between German unionists and Anglo rebels as it did 
                    to Indian raids. But by war's end, the Indian troubles were 
                    recurring.Fort McKavett was reoccupied by elements of the 
                    U.S. Army's 4th Cavalry and 35th Infantry in the spring of 
                    1868. The post apparently was in an advanced state of dilapidation, 
                    being described as &quot;one mass of ruins&quot; with only 
                    one habitable house, the former commanding officer's quarters. 
                    The troops lived in tents while repair and new construction 
                    were undertaken.</p>
                  <p class="text">The spring of 1869 brought dramatic and historic 
                    developments to the post with the arrival of the 41st Infantry 
                    and its commanding officer, Colonel Ranald Mackenzie. The 
                    41st was one of the army's six regiments&#151;four of infantry, 
                    two of cavalry&#151;having black enlisted personnel and white 
                    officers. It would be the first such unit to be headquartered 
                    at Fort McKavett, and its commander would go on to become 
                    one of the foremost Indian fighters of the post-Civil War 
                    army.</p>
                  <p class="text"><br>
                    The 41st Infantry was a well-drilled regiment when it arrived 
                    at Fort McKavett, but was new to frontier warfare. Army reorganization 
                    resulted in consolidation of the 41st and the 38th&#151;also 
                    a black regiment with white officers, but one with substantial 
                    western service&#151;to form the new 24th Infantry. Mackenzie 
                    imported five civilian carpenters and six stonemasons who, 
                    together with the soldiers of the 24th , began substantial 
                    improvement and expansion of the post, soon to be considered 
                    one of the best in Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">Mackenzie launched several expeditions from 
                    Fort McKavett during the time he commanded the post. He personally 
                    led only one, a joint venture of the 24th Infantry and 9th 
                    Cavalry. The 9th was another regiment of black enlisted men 
                    and white officers. A company of the 9th usually was stationed 
                    at Fort McKavett throughout Mackenzie's tenure, and he had 
                    additional companies at his disposal as commander of the army's 
                    Subdistrict of the Pecos. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mackenzie was on leave of absence from the post 
                    for most of 1870, leaving Lieutenant Colonel William &quot;Pecos 
                    Bill&quot; Shafter in command. It was during this time that 
                    diminutive 9th Cavalry Sergeant Emanuel Stance, leading patrol 
                    from Fort McKavett, directed his detachment of 10 troopers 
                    in two engagements with Indian raiders on successive days. 
                    Stance led three charges, two of them in the same action and 
                    all of them successful. He had fought in a total of five engagements 
                    in two years, a rarity for any soldier of the frontier army 
                    at that time, and a record that earned him the Medal of Honor.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the late 1870s, Mackenzie became the regimental 
                    commander of the 4th Cavalry, and McKavett's troops supported 
                    expeditions to the Great Plains in 1871, 1872, and 1874 and 
                    his and Shafter's forays across the Rio Grande in 1873, 1877, 
                    and 1878. In its later years, the fort probably was most valued 
                    for its quartermaster stores, as it was the intermediate post 
                    on the army's road from San Antonio to the more distant Fort 
                    Concho.</p>

                  <br><p class="text">As was the case with many Texas frontier posts, 
                    Fort McKavett had attached to it a civilian &quot;parasite&quot; 
                    settlement. Known locally as &quot;Scabtown,&quot; the collection 
                    of ramshackle buildings across the river from the post made 
                    available those vices that the fort's &quot;sutler&quot; (post 
                    trader) was not permitted to provide. In such settings, altercations 
                    between soldiers and civilians were bound to occur, and racism 
                    was never absent wherever black troops mixed with white settlers. 
                    Scabtown probably was no worse than most other such locales, 
                    but it was the setting for the notorious murders of three 
                    black soldiers by prosperous local rancher John M. &quot;Humpy&quot; 
                    Jackson and accomplices, none of whom were ever convicted 
                    by civilian authorities. </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p class="text">By 1880, most of the Indian threat on the Edwards 
                    Plateau was gone, and Fort McKavett no longer had a military 
                    mission. The post was ordered abandoned in 1882, but the large 
                    quantity of supplies stored there required extension of the 
                    order for a year. The last garrison, a company of the 16th 
                    Infantry, was transferred to Fort McIntosh on the Rio Grande.</p>
                  <p class="text">As they had in 1859, civilians moved in after 
                    the army left. The more stable of the Scabtown merchants began 
                    occupying the abandoned fort, while the &quot;camp followers&quot; 
                    moved on, many probably to Fort Concho and Santa Angela. By 
                    the mid-1890s, the civilian community of Fort McKavett was 
                    a thriving, though small, center of the sheep and goat-raising 
                    industry of the Edwards Plateau.</p>
                  <p class="text">But time and the railroads passed the town by, 
                    and the community's population peaked at about 150 in the 
                    late 1920s. Today it still has a post office, but most of 
                    the surviving buildings from the military era are located 
                    within Fort McKavett State Historic Site, operated by the 
                    Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The site includes more 
                    than two dozen structures, many of which are preserved or 
                    restored, and is the planned home of the department's Buffalo 
                    Soldiers Program archives. </p>
