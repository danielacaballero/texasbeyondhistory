                  <p class="text">One could almost call them historical bookends, 
                    the Spanish presidio and the United States Army fort separated 
                    by 20 miles and 100 years. Located off U.S. Highway 190 on 
                    opposite banks of the San Saba River west of modern Menard, 
                    these two outposts of European-based culture are mute reminders 
                    of the conflict on the Edwards Plateau in the 18th and 19th 
                    centuries. </p>
                  <p class="text">Through most of the 1600s, the High Plains of 
                    what today are eastern New Mexico and the Texas panhandle 
                    had been the range of native groups known to the Spanish as 
                    &quot;Apache.&quot; In the early 1700s, Comanche horsemen 
                    began to push onto the Plains and the Edwards Plateau. As 
                    they reached the broken Hill Country, they encountered resistance 
                    from the Apache people called &quot;Lipan.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">Spain had established a productive mission complex 
                    among the Pueblo Indians near Santa Fe and along the valley 
                    of the upper Rio Grande. But by the mid-1700s the Spanish 
                    had only a tenuous hold on the land mass that is modern Texas. 
                    The eastern settlement most comparable to Santa Fe was at 
                    San Antonio, but it was a shadow of its New Mexico counterpart.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Lipan occasionally raided the San Antonio 
                    missions, but in 1749 four of their chiefs made a peace agreement 
                    with the Spanish and appeared willing to accept missionaries 
                    in return for protection from the Comanche. After a mission 
                    on the Rio Grande proved unsuccessful, the Spanish tried again 
                    in what they believed to be Apache homeland near the heart 
                    of the Edwards Plateau. The chosen location was in a region 
                    contested by the Comanche.</p>
                  <p class="text">The mission <em>Santa Cruz de San Sab&aacute;</em> 
                    was established on the south bank of the San Saba River in 
                    1757. The protective fort, <em>Presidio San Lu&iacute;s de 
                    las Amarillas</em>, was located approximately four miles upstream, 
                    on the north bank. Lipan drifted into the mission slowly, 
                    but even then refused to stay. The puzzled Spanish had located 
                    the mission in a war zone, and in doing so had inadvertently 
                    made themselves targets of the Comanche.</p>
                  <p class="text">Less than a year after construction, the mission 
                    and presidio were attacked by a large force of Comanche, Wichita, 
                    Tonkawa, and other Indians. Eight inhabitants of the mission 
                    were killed, and it was looted and burned. The survivors joined 
                    the soldiers inside the presidio, where they took refuge until 
                    the attackers withdrew. </p>
                  <p class="text">Mission San Sab&aacute; was soon abandoned, 
                    and other missions were established for the Lipan on the Nueces 
                    River. These had some modest success, but a smallpox epidemic 
                    and Comanche raids finally drove the Lipan away. They would 
                    return to raid the Spanish settlements around San Antonio.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Comanche meanwhile strengthened their hold 
                    on the Edwards Plateau. The presidio of San Sab&aacute; survived 
                    until 1772 when it, too, was abandoned. San Antonio and the 
                    surrounding area began to experience Comanche raids in the 
                    early 1770s. Travel to the north or west became dangerous, 
                    and most commerce and communication from San Antonio to Santa 
                    Fe flowed southwest, across the Rio Grande to Monclova, then 
                    west across northern Mexico to Chihuahua, and finally north 
                    through modern El Paso to Santa Fe. The Comanche range&#151;<em>Comancher&iacute;a</em>&#151;extended 
                    from the Rocky Mountains east of Santa Fe to the Hill Country 
                    above San Antonio.</p>
                  <p class="text">At the beginning of the 1800s, the Spanish were 
                    desperate for a way to protect their Texas frontier from Indian 
                    attack. The <em>empresario</em> arrangement with Moses Austin 
                    for the settlement of Anglo colonists from the United States 
                    was considered to be Spain's last hope to establish a buffer 
                    for its beleaguered Mexican settlements below the Rio Grande. 
                    After the Mexican revolt against Spain finally succeeded in 
                    1821, the Texas settlements were virtually bereft of military 
                    protection. Only 59 soldiers were left in the province to 
                    guard about 4,000 people. The new Mexican government was unable 
                    to defend its own northern settlements or those of the new 
                    colonists in eastern Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Edwards Plateau became part of the home 
                    range of the Penateka band of Comanche, The Penateka name 
                    translated roughly as &quot;Honey Eaters,&quot; possibly an 
                    allusion to the richness of the plant and wildlife resources 
                    found near their camps along the streams of the Hill Country. 
                    They had other names as well, one of which translated as &quot;Wasps,&quot; 
                    or &quot;Quick Stingers.&quot; Settlers victimized by their 
                    raids could attest to the appropriateness of those references.</p>

                  <p class="text">Prior to their own revolt against Mexico, the 
                    Anglo-Texans had little contact with the Penateka. San Antonio 
                    was still primarily a Spanish-Mexican town. But the flood 
                    of immigration that accompanied nationhood pushed white settlement 
                    to the Balcones Escarpment, which formed the eastern and southern 
                    rim of the Edwards Plateau. In 1839, President Mirabeau B. 
                    Lamar succeeded in having the capital of the Republic of Texas 
                    relocated to the north bank of the Colorado River some 30 
                    miles upstream from the town of Bastrop. The site selected, 
                    a tiny hamlet originally called Waterloo, lay on the fringe 
                    of the Penateka range. </p>
                  <p class="text">The act at first was largely symbolic, a westward 
                    shift of the seat of government&#151;soon to be named &quot;Austin&quot;&#151;that 
                    matched Lamar's vision of a great Texas empire. But it also 
                    forced the Texas Congress to accept Lamar's plans for frontier 
                    defense, including the financing of a regular army and the 
                    construction of military posts along the edges of white settlement. 
                    Three initially were built: Fort Houston on what was then 
                    the northern frontier, Fort Colorado (also known as the Walnut 
                    Creek Fort) near Austin, and Fort Little River (also known 
                    as the Three Forks Fort) more or less midway between the other 
                    two.</p>
                  <p class="text">But settlers were not content to merely defend 
                    the territory they already occupied. Early in 1839, veteran 
                    Indian fighter John Henry Moore led a force against a Comanche 
                    camp above the San Saba River. Although the expedition's success 
                    was debatable, it did signal to the Penateka that the Anglo-Texans 
                    would not be passive victims of Indian raiding. A cholera 
                    epidemic swept through the Comanche camps in the winter of 
                    1839-1840, and spring brought the disaster of the Council 
                    House fight in San Antonio. Successive hammer blows struck 
                    the Penateka in battles at Plum Creek and their own camp on 
                    the Concho River later in the year. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The Penateka could not stand such a succession 
                    of losses, and they withdrew from much of their home range. 
                    For the next 15 years, they alternately raided the fringes 
                    of white settlement, bartered with official traders appointed 
                    by the Republic of Texas, and negotiated with Indian agents 
                    of the United States. Although they never again were able 
                    to hold the Edwards Plateau against invaders, they continued 
                    to use it as their range and as a route for raids into Mexico.</p>

                    protection of Austin and the German and Alsatian settlements 
                    became the responsibility of the U.S. Army. The southern anchors 
                    of a &quot;frontier line&quot; of forts were placed near the 
                    edge of the Edwards Plateau. Fort Martin Scott was established 
                    in 1848 at Fredericksburg, the settlement most exposed to 
                    Plains Indian raids. Then followed Fort Croghan, located near 
                    the Colorado River above Austin; Fort Lincoln, on Seco Creek 
                    north of the Alsatian hamlet of D'Hanis; and Fort Inge, on 
                    the Leona River west of Castroville. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Although Fredericksburg may have appeared to 
                    be the most vulnerable settlement, defense of the Castro Colony 
                    occupied more of the Army's attention in the early 1850s. 
                    The settlements at the base of the Balcones Escarpment frequently 
                    were victimized by Indian raiders, and companies of the 2nd 
                    Dragoons from Fort Inge and Fort Lincoln occasionally were 
                    able to conduct a fruitful pursuit.</p>
                  <p class="text">It was quickly evident, however, that most of 
                    the forts were located too far east&#151;on or behind the 
                    frontier of settlement&#151;to give even mounted troops a 
                    chance to do anything about the raiders except chase them 
                    after they had struck. The army's answer to this problem was 
                    to abandon most of the original &quot;frontier line&quot; 
                    of forts and to construct a second series of posts farther 
                    west. </p>
                  <p class="text">A garrison was retained at Fort Inge, the westernmost 
                    of the original posts. Forts Croghan, Martin Scott, and Lincoln 
                    were vacated. Fort Mason was established about 40 miles northwest 
                    of Fredericksburg as a replacement for both Croghan and Martin 
                    Scott. Fort McKavett was located near the headwaters of the 
                    San Saba River, about 40 miles west of Fort Mason, and Fort 
                    Terrett was placed about 40 miles south of McKavett on the 
                    north fork of the Llano River.</p>
                  <p class="text">Forts McKavett and Terrett were situated near 
                    one of the Comanche travel routes from the Plains into Mexico. 
                    This was a matter of some consequence. The United States, 
                    as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that concluded 
                    the Mexican War, had agreed to try to stop Indian raids into 
                    Mexico. Fort Inge, about 125 miles almost due south of McKavett 
                    and just off the Edwards Plateau, gave the army a third post 
                    near the Comanche trail.</p>
                  <p class="text">This scheme, though logical, was at first ineffective. 
                    Fort Terrett was abandoned in 1854, only two years after it 
                    was established. Fort McKavett lasted seven years, but there 
                    are no reports of Indian fights involving troops from the 
                    post during that time. Companies of the 2nd Dragoons and the 
                    Regiment of Mounted Riflemen garrisoned at Fort Inge directed 
                    most of their attention to the Nueces Strip&#151;the plain 
                    between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande&#151;because of 
                    the frequency of raids on <em>ranchos</em> near Laredo. </p>
                  <p class="text">The situation changed in 1856, with the arrival 
                    and deployment of the 2nd Cavalry. This regiment was to become 
                    one of the most celebrated units in the history of the United 
                    States Army, and included 16 future Civil War generals among 
                    its officer corps. Its commander, Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston, 
                    established headquarters at Fort Mason.</p>
                  <p class="text">Johnston and the regiment's lieutenant colonel, 
                    Robert E. Lee, put the unit to the task of scouring the country 
                    from the Brazos River to the Nueces&#151;the entire Edwards 
                    Plateau and then some&#151;in search of Indians. The regiment 
                    recorded more hostile actions against Indians than any other 
                    U.S. Army unit in Texas prior to the Civil War. Nearly two-thirds 
                    of the engagements occurred on the Edwards Plateau. </p>
                  <p class="text">With the coming of secession and Civil War, 
                    Texas frontier folk fell back on the same types of defenses 
                    they had used during the Republic period: Texas-funded regular 
                    troops (the &quot;Frontier Regiment&quot;), militia, and a 
                    Frontier Organization that patrolled similarly to the rangers 
                    of the Republic but functioned no more efficiently than militia. 
                    By 1864, the frontier was under assault by northern Comanche 
                    and their Kiowa allies.</p>
                  <p class="text">Reports received from some officials of frontier 
                    counties indicate 163 settlers killed, 24 wounded, and 43 
                    carried away by Indian raiders during the period from the 
                    summer of 1865 to the summer of 1867. Many of these were no 
                    doubt from the counties north of the Edwards Plateau, above 
                    the Brazos River, where settlements were particularly vulnerable. 
                    But anecdotal reports from the Hill Country reflect a serious 
                    enough condition there. From Llano to Lampasas, the stories 
                    were the same: it had been 20 years since the Indians had 
                    been so numerous, so well-armed, and so bold; farmers were 
                    regularly being shot down in their fields, or their livestock 
                    driven away as they watched helplessly; the frontier was &quot;breaking 
                    up,&quot; would have to be abandoned.</p>
                  <p class="text">After the war, the state was prohibited from 
                    fielding its own defense forces. The U.S. Army was quick to 
                    get troops to the Rio Grande, but moved much more slowly to 
                    the western frontier. This reflected the army's concern, and 
                    that of the national government, for the international boundary 
                    and the post-war Reconstruction mission. One company of the 
                    4th Cavalry was posted to Fort Martin Scott early in 1866 
                    and another to Fort Inge. In November and December of that 
                    year, two companies were sent to Fort Mason and three to Camp 
                    Verde, south of Fredericksburg in modern Kerr County.</p>

                    hardest fighting outfits in the army during the Indian Wars. 
                    Its total of 36 engagements while stationed on the Texas frontier 
                    equaled that of the pre-war 2nd Cavalry. But it was the 9th

                    and escort responsibilities for most of southwest Texas. In 
                    addition to its postings at Fort Concho and Fort McKavett,

                  <p class="text">Between them, the 4th and 9th Cavalry fought

                    the heavy regimen of mounted patrols emanating from those 
                    posts, helped deflect Comanche and Kiowa raiders away from 
                    the Hill Country settlements as the Indians traveled to and 
                    from Mexico.</p>
                  <p class="text">The frontier forts both provided protection 
                    for civilians already in the area and served as a magnet for 
                    further immigration. The army's need for goods and services 
                    created a cash market for local farmers, stockmen, and tradesmen. 
                    Products that could not be provided by local suppliers were 
                    freighted in from San Antonio, by either army wagons or civilian 
                    contractors. The &quot;military road&quot; that connected 
                    San Antonio to Fort Martin Scott, then to Fort Mason and Fort 
                    McKavett and, ultimately, to Fort Concho, served both the 
                    army and the civilian communities through which it passed. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">This route was the first leg of what was known 
                    as the &quot;upper road&quot; from San Antonio to El Paso 
                    after the Civil War. The army's pre-war route&#151;known as 
                    the &quot;lower road&quot;&#151;ran directly west from San 
                    Antonio, through Fort Inge and Fort Clark, before turning 
                    northwest and crossing the Devil's River and the Pecos River. 
                    Shortly after Ben Ficklin took control of passenger and mail 
                    transportation on the El Paso Road in 1867, operations were 
                    shifted from the &quot;lower&quot; to the &quot;upper&quot; 
                    route. After passing near Fort Concho, the road turned southwest 
                    to the Pecos, running roughly along the same line as the old 
                    Butterfield mail route and the Goodnight-Loving cattle trail. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Ficklin established relay stations along the 
                    route at and between forts and settlements. The station on 
                    the Concho River became the junction of the San Antonio and 
                    El Paso road and the one from Fort Smith, Arkansas, that came 
                    by way of Fort Belknap, Fort Richardson, and Fort Griffin. 
                    The latter was essentially the north Texas stretch of the 
                    former Butterfield trail, and the intersection of these two 
                    routes turned the Concho station into a frontier crossroads. 
                    Two settlements&#151;one called &quot;Benficklin&quot; and 
                    the other, closer to Fort Concho, known as &quot;Santa Angela&quot;&#151;were 
                    soon competing for commercial supremacy in the area. Benficklin 
                    succumbed to a flood on the Concho River. Santa Angela, sometimes 
                    referred to by soldiers merely as &quot;over the river,&quot; 
                    survived to become the county seat of Tom Green County.</p>

                    Fort McKavett followed in 1883, its buildings quickly occupied  
                    by the stockmen and merchants who had been drawn to the area  
                    within the protection of the army's cavalry patrols. Fort 
                    Concho hung on until 1889. After the fort was abandoned, its 
                    buildings slowly were incorporated into the renamed community
