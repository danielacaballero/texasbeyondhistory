  <p class="text"><span class="blue">In this<strong> upcoming</strong> interactive experience, 
    you'll learn all about the soldiers, settlers, gamblers, buffalo hunters, 
    and cowboys who ventured onto the Texas frontier in the 1860s and 1870s, when 
    the land was wide open prairie and there was nary a house in sight. From Doc 
    Holiday to Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman to a young child named Sallie, the 
    area had its share of fascinating characters. </span> </p>

  <p class="text"><img src="images/kidskickingbird.jpg" width="230" height="200" align="right"><span class="blue">But 
    there were Indians who already claimed the north Texas lands…and they fought 
    fiercely for the right to live there and hunt buffalo on the grassy prairies. 
    Other Indians, such as the Tonkawa, went to live near the U.S. Army post known 
    as Fort Griffin, where they became valued scouts for the soldiers.</span><span class="purple">

  <p class="text"><img src="images/clash.jpg" width="298" height="200" align="left"><span class="blue">For 
    this new activity, award-winning children's book author Lisa Waller Rogers, 
    brings 17 historical characters to life through first person "interviews." 
    If you've read <em>The Great Storm</em> or <em>Get Along, Little Dogies</em>, 
    then you already know about the fascinating stories she tells. They are a 
    great way to learn about Texas history.</span></p>

  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Charles Shaw, who has painted more pictures 
    about Texas than you can count, will create the colorful scene that takes 
    you back into history to a time not so long ago, but very unlike what we know 
    today. You will also be able to look at old photographs of the people who 
    there, read maps, check out some of the Fort buildings, and see "living history 
    interpreters" who dress in frontier costumes today to help recreate the past. 
    </span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Stay tuned for this fun and educational experience. 
    And tell your teachers, too. We will create special activities and lessons 
    to bring it all together in your classroom. </span></p>
