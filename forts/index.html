      <p class="text">Scattered across the state from the Red River to the Rio 
        Grande are the remnants of what was once a formidable military presence 
        on the frontier&#151;Texas' nineteenth-century forts. Some are ghostly 
        ruins, others have been painstakingly reconstructed to evoke a sense of 
        the lives that played out inside their walls. But these architectural 
        artifacts are more than the nostalgic representatives of a romanticized 
        period of American history. They are the visible reminders of the especially 
        violent cultural conflict that erupted as lines of white settlement moved 
        westward across the state into the domain of the Kiowas, Comanches, and 
        other Plains Indians. </p>
      <p class="text">The forts and the frontier served as a proving ground for 
        such great military commanders as Robert E. Lee and Quanah Parker. Buffalo 
        hunters, gamblers, and entrepreneurs plied the scabtowns nearby. The sections 
        that follow tell these and other stories, placing them in the context 
        of the larger drama that attended a half-century of warfare between two 
        ways of life that ultimately could not exist in the same land.</p>
      <p class="text"><img src="images/kickingbird2.jpg" width="350" height="207" align="left" alt="Kicking Bird">As 
        the historian Robert Utley has explained, the Army faced problems in Texas 
        that it did not have elsewhere on the Plains, where its main challenge 
        was protecting white travelers on their way west. Texas posed that problem, 
        to be sure, but it had something else that presented an even graver issue: 
        two implacably hostile cultures whose settlements lay within striking 
        distance of each other. These elements of hearth and home gave the Texas 
        conflict an intensely personal character. For white and red peoples alike, 
        &quot;Indian policy&quot; was not a bureaucratic abstraction. It was life 
        filled with the daily prospect of an enemy at the door</p>
      <p class="text">The army defended three geographically distinct frontiers, 
        as well as a transcontinental travel route through yet a fourth region. 
        Each of these regions had unique attributes that shaped the army's mission 
        and performance over time, and each in turn was shaped by the army's presence 
        there. </p>
      <p class="text">Texas has had an almost symbiotic relationship with the 
        military forces of the United States. Like so much of Texas history and 
        culture, this has been largely a matter of geography. With a long international 
        border and coastline, fear of foreign attack was a real concern of Texans 
        for more than a century. But it was the special vulnerability of Texas' 
        internal frontiers that most defined Texan's attitudes toward security 
        in the last half of the 19th century. These web &quot;exhibits&quot; are 
        a tour of the frontier conflict. </p>

        begin your frontier journey, click on one of the headings above. <strong>The 
        Die Is Cast </strong> sets the tone and foreshadows the brutal conflict of 
        cultures in the state. <strong>Texas and the Western Frontier </strong>by Ty Cashion 
        and <strong> U.S. Military on the Texas Frontier </strong>by Robert Wooster each 
        provide overviews of the Anglo settlers determined westward journey and 
        the Army's role in protecting them. Sections on<strong> Forts McKavett, Griffin, 
        Davis, </strong>and <strong>Clark</strong> provide a more-detailed look at conflicts 
        in vastly different regions of the state, many of which stemmed from much 
        earlier rivalries and disputes among the various cultures. The narrative, 
        <strong>Passing of the Indian Era</strong> recounts the journeys and rivalries of 
        historic-period Indian groups in Texas, the near-destruction of their 
        cultures, and their eventual removal from the state. The <strong> Timeline 
        </strong>helps frame events on the Texas frontier era in a larger context. 
        &quot;Meet the People of Fort Griffin and The Flat, &quot; a <strong>children's</strong> 
        <strong>activity</strong> by Lisa Waller Rogers, provides a fascinating look at 
        the colorful characters in a Texas frontier fort and boom town. Specially 
        developed <strong>curricula</strong> for teachers has been correlated to the exhibits 
        above. </p>
