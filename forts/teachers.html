<h2>Resources for Teaching About 19th-Century Texas Forts and the Western Frontier</h2>
      <p class="text"><img src="images/Illustration-flat-no-5-sm.gif" width="250" height="262" align="right">Welcome 
        teachers. In this section, you will find lesson plans designed to help 
        your students understand the dramatic conflicts that occurred on the 19th-century 
        Texas frontier as settlers moved westward into the state. Understanding 
        based on different time periods (pre- and post-Civil War) and different 
        perspectives is encouraged, including that of Anglo settlers, U.S. soldiers, 
        and the Native Americans who considered the lands their domain. Other 
        lessons look at towns and forts on the Texas frontier.</p>
      <p class="text">Designed for different grade levels and subject areas, the 
        lessons are based on the objectives of the Texas Essential Knowledge and 
        Skills (TEKS). Each lesson is in Pdf format for easy downloading and printing 
        for use in class. The lessons were written by experienced teachers: Dr. 
        Mary Black, education consultant for TBH and former instructor in the 
        Department of Curriculum and Instruction at UT-Austin, and Laine Liebick, 
        4th-grade teacher at Highland Park Elementary School in Austin.</p>
      <p class="text">Although many of the materials in the forts exhibits are 
        copyrighted, teachers and their students may freely download any of the 
        images and information for educational use such as class projects, book 
        reports, and bulletin boards, provided that the source is acknowledged. 
        Please work with your students so they will learn how to properly credit 
        sources and avoid plagiarism. No commercial use or republishing (on the 
        web or in printed form) of any material on <em>Texas Beyond History </em>is 
        allowed without the express permission from the copyright holder.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>7th-Grade</h3>
      <p class="text">In <a href="../teach/images/Moving-West.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">Moving 
        West with the Forts</a> students read a map of Texas forts and analyze 
        westward movement from Statehood to the Civil War.</p>
      <h3>4th- and 7th-Grade </h3>
      <p class="text"><a href="../teach/images/Timeline-Frontier.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">Timeline 
        for the Western Texas Frontier</a> engages students in constructing a 
        timeline of events, helping them to understand the rapid changes in population, 
        settlement, migration, transportation, and political control of Texas 
        as it expanded westward.</p>
      <p class="text">In <a href="../teach/images/Two-Ways-of-Life.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">Two 
        Ways of Life</a>, students compare the ways of life of Indians on the 
        western Texas frontier and U.S. military men at the Texas forts. This 
        lesson helps students understand the clash of cultures that occurred in 
        Texas and the west during the 19th century that ended with the removal 
        and virtual destruction of most Native Americans from the state.</p>
      <h3>4th grade</h3>
      <p class="text"><a href="../teach/images/Whose-Business.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">Whose 
        Business?</a> allows students to compare the businesses in the nineteenth-century 
        boomtown known as Fort Griffin (or The Flat) to those in the students' 
        community. In the process, they will investigate the factors that influence 
        the development of specific types of businesses in a community.</p>
      <p class="text">In 
        <a href="../teach/images/Day-Life.pdf" target="_blank" class="text">A 
        Day in the Life</a>, students explore the roles of a variety of people 
        who lived or worked at a nineteenth-century Texas frontier fort or in 
        a nearby frontier town. By writing about a character in his/her own voice, 
        students reach a greater understanding of life on the Texas frontier.</p>
