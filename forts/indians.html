                  <p class="text">Long before the United States Army set foot 
                    in Texas, disaster stalked the aboriginal peoples who lived 
                    beyond the Anglo frontier. European-borne disease, intertribal 
                    conflict, and diminishing resources had fatally weakened some 
                    of the bands not yet obliterated. Indigenous cultures were 
                    being crushed by forces coming from all directions. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The boundaries of modern Texas encompass vastly 
                    different ecosystems and&#151;on the eve of Spanish intrusion&#151;each 
                    region was home to different cultures. Among the major groupings 
                    were the Caddoan cultures of the eastern forests, the Atakapan 
                    and Karankawan people of the Gulf coast, the Coahuiltecan-speakers 
                    of the southern Rio Grande plain, the Jumano of the middle 
                    Rio Grande and central plateaus, and the Apachean people of 
                    the High Plains. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Others would appear on the scene. The Tonkawa 
                    and Wichita would migrate from the north under pressure. The 
                    Comanche and Kiowa would push their way onto the southern 
                    Plains a century after the early Spanish explorations. The 
                    Cherokee and Kickapoo would come from the southeast as refugees 
                    in the early 1800s. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The Spanish colonial efforts brought the first 
                    destructive forces. Thousands of the early native peoples 
                    did not survive the process the Spanish called &quot;reduction.&quot; 
                    Some were missionized or kidnapped into slavery in the silver 
                    mines of central Mexico. Others were able to escape and to 
                    be absorbed by other tribes. In the end, the Spanish reduced 
                    these peoples more by disease than by religious conversion. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The sicknesses brought by Spanish missionaries 
                    and French traders devastated entire villages. Outbreaks of 
                    smallpox among the Coahuiltecans were widespread both north 
                    and south of the Rio Grande in the winter of 1674-1675, wiped 
                    out most of the Rio Grande mission population in 1706, and&#151;along 
                    with a measles epidemic&#151;almost depopulated the San Antonio 
                    missions in 1739. Unknown diseases were estimated to have 
                    killed 3,000 among the Caddoan tribes in 1691, and additional 
                    numbers in 1718. Mission Atakapans were stricken twice in 
                    the 1750s. Karankawas suffered a &quot;devastating scourge&quot; 
                    of measles and/or smallpox in 1766.</p>
                  <p class="text">Some tribes were broken up by raiding Apaches, 
                    who came to dominate the Plains by the end of the 1600s. The 
                    earliest encounter between Spaniards and Apache groups had 
                    occurred in 1541, in either the northeastern portion of modern 
                    New Mexico or the panhandle of modern Texas. Francisco Vasqez 
                    de Coronado gave the name &quot;Querecho&quot; to the people 
                    he met there. A later exploration led by Vicente de Saldivar 
                    Mendoza in 1599 encountered bands and villages (&quot;rancherias&quot;) 
                    of people that Mendoza termed &quot;vaqueros.&quot; These 
                    people were bison hunters, and as the Spanish had no concept 
                    of bison other than as cattle, they characterized the woolly 
                    animals as &quot;vacas.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">By the time the Spanish began to establish settlements 
                    in the upper Rio Grande valley, the native puebloans had a 
                    brisk trade going with the Plains people. The vaqueros brought 
                    buffalo robes, meat, and tallow in exchange for cloth, pottery, 
                    maize, and small green stones. But the Spanish tried to control 
                    the trade, and by the mid-1600s were making captives of the 
                    Plains Indians for use as slaves in the mines of Mexico. Thus 
                    began a long period of hostility between the Spanish and the 
                    Plains Apache. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Spanish categorized the Apache of New Mexico 
                    into western and eastern branches. The easterners included 
                    bands that had become closely associated with the Pueblo communities 
                    such as Pecos and Taos, as well as bands who lived farther 
                    out on the Plains. Historians believe the Plains people included 
                    the groupings that later became known as &quot;Kiowa Apache 
                    and &quot;Lipan Apache.&quot; Both were displaced by the people 
                    the Spanish called &quot;Comanche.&quot;</p>

                  <p class="text">The Comanche are a Shoshonean people who migrated 
                    from the north to the southeastern plains of modern Colorado. 
                    The name, &quot;Comanche,&quot; is believed to be the Spanish 
                    derivative of a Ute word meaning &quot;someone who wants to 
                    fight with me all the time.&quot; The first Spanish sighting 
                    of Comanches in New Mexico occurred in 1705. Less than 15 
                    years passed before the newcomers began to unsettle New Mexico's 
                    northeastern frontier with attacks against the pueblos and 
                    Apache rancherias. The Comanche then embarked on a complicated 
                    50-year pattern of alternately raiding the Spanish and trading 
                    with them, but their attitude toward the Plains Apache was 
                    unremittingly hostile.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the mid-1700s, the Comanche had shattered 
                    the Apache presence in eastern New Mexico. Some villagers 
                    left the Plains and withdrew to the relative security of the 
                    pueblos. Others retreated to the east in the face of the Comanche 
                    onslaught. In 1724, Comanches were reported to have defeated 
                    a force of Plains Apaches in a nine-day battle somewhere in 
                    northwestern Texas called El Gran Sierra del Fierro. </p>
                  <p class="text">Comanche movement onto the southern Plains was 
                    in a generally southeastern direction throughout the 1700s. 
                    The deeper the migration moved into Texas, the more it pressured 
                    the Lipan, who occupied the Edwards Plateau. The Lipan adjustments 
                    brought them into contact with the Wichita and Tonkawa in 
                    the vicinity of the Cross Timbers to the east. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Spanish had discovered Wichita villages 
                    in 1541, then again during Juan de O&ntilde;ate's expedition 
                    in 1601. The explorers found many large settlements dispersed 
                    along rivers and streams in an area encompassing the south-central 
                    portion of modern Kansas and the north-central portion of 
                    modern Oklahoma. These settlements began to be moved southward, 
                    beyond the reach of raiding Osage Indians, who in the early 
                    1700s were being supplied with guns by French traders. </p>
                  <p class="text">O&ntilde;ate's expedition also had encountered 
                    the Tonkawa, in either the region of the modern Oklahoma panhandle 
                    or the south-central portion of modern Kansas. There appear 
                    to have been two groups of Tonkawa speakers by the late 1600s, 
                    one located along and north of the Red River in modern Oklahoma 
                    and the other along and between the Brazos and Navasota rivers 
                    in Texas. By the mid-1700s, some Tonkawa had begun to congregate 
                    at a large settlement, known as the &quot;Rancheria Grande,&quot; 
                    on the San Gabriel River of central Texas.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Rancheria Grande was a haven for a number 
                    of disparate aboriginal groups driven from their homelands. 
                    In 1748, the Spanish established a mission and presidio on 
                    the San Gabriel to protect the Rancheria Grande refugees from 
                    Lipan raids, but Spanish protection proved illusory, and the 
                    mission was abandoned in 1756.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Tonkawa then allied themselves with the 
                    Wichita, which in turn brought them into a short-lived alliance 
                    with the Comanche with whom the Wichita traded and shared 
                    a hostility toward the Plains Apache. In 1758, a force of 
                    Comanche, Tonkawa, Wichita, and representatives of other tribal 
                    groups attacked a Spanish mission established for the Lipan 
                    on the San Saba River. </p>
                  <p class="text">To replace the San Saba mission, the Spanish 
                    established two others for the Lipan in the El Canon area 
                    of the upper Nueces River west of San Antonio. These immediately 
                    fell prey to Comanche raiding parties. The wedge of Comanche 
                    advance split the Lipan. Some, who became known as &quot;upper&quot; 
                    Lipan, would gravitate toward the southwest, into the range 
                    of their Mescalero Apache kinsmen. The &quot;lower,&quot; 
                    or &quot;southern,&quot; Lipan moved south and east, to the 
                    fringes of the Edwards Plateau and beyond. </p>
                  <p class="text">Meanwhile, Wichita groups moved from above the 
                    Red River into the middle Brazos and upper Trinity River valleys. 
                    The Wichitas' ever-deeper intrusion into Tonkawa territory 
                    ended the brief period of amicable relations between the two 
                    tribes. The Tonkawa slid southward in response, and with their 
                    former Lipan enemies formed a new trade relationship with 
                    southeastern tribes and the French in Louisiana.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Comanche extended their control of the southern 
                    Plains&#151;soon to be called &quot;Comancheria&quot; by the 
                    Spanish&#151;onto and beyond the Edwards Plateau by the end 
                    of the 1700s. They secured their western flank and profitable 
                    trade relationships in 1786 by entering into a truce with 
                    the Spanish in New Mexico. About 1800, they absorbed a threat 
                    coming from their northeast by entering into an historic truce 
                    with the Kiowa, another tribe of Plains raiders.</p>

                  <p class="text">The Kiowa are believed to have migrated from 
                    the Yellowstone River region of modern Wyoming or Montana 
                    under easterly pressure from the Cheyenne and Sioux. They 
                    were accompanied onto the southern Plains by the Kiowa Apache, 
                    a group linguistically related to the Lipan of Texas and Apache 
                    of New Mexico, but who had earlier migrated to the north and 
                    attached themselves politically to larger and stronger tribes. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"> As the Kiowa moved south, they continued to 
                    be pressed from the east&#151;in this case by the Pawnee and 
                    Osage&#151;and probably encountered the Comanche near the 
                    Arkansas River in modern Kansas. Elements of the two tribes 
                    initially dueled over this portion of the buffalo range before 
                    forging an alliance that would exist for more than a century.<br>
                    <br>
                    Interactions among the diverse peoples of Spanish Texas became 
                    increasingly skewed by forces east of the Mississippi River. 
                    The English colonists of the mid-Atlantic seaboard had displaced 
                    the tribes along and on either side of the Appalachian mountain 
                    range and forced some of them into the &quot;Northwest Territory,&quot; 
                    the area drained by the Ohio River and embracing much of the 
                    modern states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. This migration 
                    had forced the Osage to abandon the Ohio valley for the prairies 
                    of modern Kansas and Oklahoma. In the early 1800s, they were 
                    joined there by several of the tribes that had elbowed them 
                    out of the old Northwest Territory&#151;Delaware, Kickapoo, 
                    Potawatomi, and Shawnee among them&#151;as those tribes were 
                    again displaced by whites. Now, however, the eviction notices 
                    were being served by the new United States of America.</p>
                  <p class="text">Similar pressure on the southeastern tribes 
                    caused many Cherokees to move from the southern Appalachia 
                    hills into western Arkansas. Others followed the Alabama and 
                    Coushatta tribes into Texas, invited along with Anglo-American 
                    colonists during the waning days of Spanish rule.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1825, U.S. President James Monroe suggested 
                    the idea of moving all of the Indians out of the eastern United 
                    States to &quot;vacant&quot; lands west of the Mississippi. 
                    The region between the Missouri River and the Red River became 
                    envisioned in the white mind as the &quot;Indian Territory&quot; 
                    that could be used to relocate all of the tribes removed from 
                    the east. The southeastern tribes&#151;Cherokee, Chickasaw, 
                    Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole&#151;joined the lately arrived, 
                    old Northwest tribes as interlopers on the lands historically 
                    occupied by the Wichita north of the Red River.</p>
                  <p class="text">The fringes of the southern Plains soon became 
                    crowded. The &quot;removed&quot; tribes spread out, impinged 
                    on each other, and filtered south into Mexican Texas. Some 
                    took up residence among the Caddo villages of the eastern 
                    Texas pine forests. Others gravitated to the Wichita villages 
                    farther west, such as those of the Waco and Tawakoni along 
                    the Brazos River valley. The Lipan and Tonkawa also found 
                    themselves with new neighbors to their south, where they encountered 
                    the Anglo-American colonists moving up the Brazos, Colorado, 
                    and Guadalupe River valleys from the Gulf Coast.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Americans became successors to the raid-and-trade 
                    relationship the Lipan and Tonkawa had conducted with the 
                    Louisiana French. By the mid-1830s, Anglo-Texan settlers were 
                    joining the Tonkawa in attacks on Wichita and Comanche villages. 
                    The Anglos most likely found the Comanche at the edge of the 
                    Cross Timbers of northern central Texas. The Tonkawa called 
                    these Comanche &quot;penetixka,&quot; and they probably were 
                    of the division of Comanches that would become the best-known 
                    to the Anglo-Texans. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Anglos separated the Comanche divisions 
                    into &quot;southern,&quot; &quot;middle,&quot; and &quot;northern&quot; 
                    groupings. At least 13 major and minor tribal divisions were 
                    known to, or remembered by, the Comanche who survived into 
                    the late 1800s. The later Anglo accounts emphasize seven divisions. 
                    The Penateka were the most numerous and sometimes were called 
                    &quot;southern Comanches&quot; by contemporary white men. 
                    The Nokoni, Tanima, and Tenewa would be grouped together as 
                    the &quot;middle&quot; Comanche. The Kotsoteka, Quahadi, and 
                    Yamparika would be considered &quot;northern.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Stephen F. Austin secured relatively peaceful relationships 
                    with the Tonkawa and Lipan while his colonists drove the Karankawa 
                    into virtual extinction. When Texas independence was declared 
                    in 1836, Sam Houston was dispatched to make treaties with 
                    the Cherokee and other immigrant tribes on the northern frontier. 
                    Houston succeeded and, although the Texas Congress would reject 
                    many of his efforts, the Republic of Texas attempted to maintain 
                    peace with most of the tribes throughout Houston's first term 
                    as president.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Houston's successor, Mirabeau B. Lamar, dramatically 
                    changed Texas Indian policy. Most of the immigrant tribes 
                    of eastern Texas were driven out of the state&#151;only the 
                    Alabama and Coushatta were allowed to remain&#151;and the 
                    Caddo and Wichita retreated up the Brazos River. The Penateka 
                    suffered heavy losses to disease and battles with white soldiers, 
                    militiamen, and rangers during the early 1840s, when Lipan 
                    and Tonkawa were enthusiastic scouts and warriors for the 
                    Anglos in their raids on Comanche villages. By the time Houston 
                    resumed the presidency in 1841, the Penateka had withdrawn 
                    from the Cross Timbers and Edwards Plateau.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The Texas government returned to Houston's 
                    earlier Indian policies during the remainder of the Republic 
                    period. These efforts included the establishment of trading 
                    houses at which even Comanches could exchange hides for manufactured 
                    goods. Extensive negotiations were conducted and several treaties 
                    were concluded. But the agreements were always one-sided: 
                    the Indians would return any captives and stolen livestock 
                    and would not come into white settlements except for authorized 
                    trading. Although the Penateka demanded an identifiable boundary 
                    to mark Comanche lands that whites could not enter, none was 
                    ever agreed to by the government.</p>
                  <p class="text">Annexation to the United States in 1845 brought 
                    Texas theoretically under the protection of the U.S. Army, 
                    which in 1848 began to build forts along the frontier of white 
                    settlement. By the early 1850s, the U.S. government gave up 
                    on the national policy of trying to &quot;remove&quot; Indians 
                    beyond the reach of white migration, and in its place substituted 
                    the idea of confining the Indians on reservations that whites 
                    could simply bypass on their way west.</p>
                  <p> <span class="text">The U.S. government owned no land in 
                    Texas, and had to await the state legislature's authorization 
                    of two reservations on the Brazos River in 1854. One, the 
                    &quot;Brazos Reserve,&quot; was located near the Army's Fort 
                    Belknap and housed about 2,000 remnants of the Caddoan and 
                    Wichita groups, Tonkawa, and Delaware. The other, on the Clear 
                    Fork of the Brazos (the &quot;Upper Reserve&quot;), accommodated 
                    as many as 450 Penateka Comanche. Residents of both reservations 
                    were instructed to take up farming. Those of the Brazos Reserve 
                    had some success, and also furnished scouts and warrior allies 
                    for the Army and Texas rangers.</span></p>
                  <p class="text"> Local white opposition forced the removal of 
                    the reservation residents to the &quot;Indian Territory.&quot; 
                    There, some became pawns in the white man's Civil War, as 
                    both Union and Confederate emissaries attempted to enlist 
                    them in the conflict. In 1862, about half of the 300 Tonkawa 
                    were massacred by members of other tribes, some of whom were 
                    Union allies. The survivors sought refuge near Fort Belknap, 
                    and a substantial number served in the Texans' frontier defense 
                    organization for the remainder of the war.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Civil War period brought something of a 
                    retrenchment on the western Texas frontier. Mexico became 
                    a refuge for migrating bands of Kickapoo, Lipan, and Seminole 
                    who shunned the reservations in Indian Territory. Comanches 
                    and Kiowas continued to travel their historic trails between 
                    the High Plains and the Rio Grande. The early 1860s were comparatively 
                    quiet along the frontier line, perhaps due to the Comanches 
                    and Kiowas skirting the edge of white settlement. But military 
                    patrols began to lapse as the Civil War reached its height, 
                    the Indians became emboldened, and the whites began to abandon 
                    the state's westernmost counties as raids increased. </p>
                  <p class="text">But time was running out for the Plains tribes. 
                    The Penateka had declined rapidly in the years before the 
                    war, and the status of the &quot;middle&quot; Comanches was 
                    increasingly precarious. The Tenewa had become all but extinct 
                    as an identifiable division. Even the northern Comanche bands 
                    had found that their villages were not beyond the reach of 
                    the white man's raiding parties. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The attacks by soldiers and rangers had been 
                    demoralizing, but what made the losses critical was that they 
                    compounded the devastation wrought by disease. An 1816 smallpox 
                    epidemic had killed an estimated 4,000 Comanche, along with 
                    significant numbers of Kiowa and Kiowa Apache. A recurrence 
                    of the disease in the winter of 1839-1840 killed large numbers 
                    in each tribe. A cholera epidemic in 1849 took even greater 
                    numbers than had been lost to smallpox. The Plains tribes 
                    were again struck by &quot;terrible ravages&quot; of smallpox 
                    in 1861.</p>
                  <p class="text">Perhaps most ominous of all was the often erratic 
                    availability of resources. The bison&#151;or buffalo&#151;had 
                    been a staple of Plains life since prehistoric times, providing 
                    food, clothing, shelter, and utensils. The spread of Spanish 
                    horses from the New Mexico settlements onto the Great Plains 
                    had changed the character of the aboriginal bison culture. 
                    Hunters no longer had to rely on herds wandering into their 
                    vicinity so that they could steer the animals into a trap. 
                    Once mounted, hunters and their families became pursuers. 
                    Mobility&#151;the ability to follow the buffalo in any and 
                    all seasons&#151;became the prerequisite to prosperity. Horses 
                    provided that mobility, but the same horse that carried a 
                    hunter after the buffalo also carried him into contact with 
                    competing hunters from other tribes.</p>

                  <p class="text">By the early 1800s, Comanche and Kiowa, Arapaho 
                    and southern Cheyenne, and Osage and Pawnee began bumping 
                    into each other on the buffalo range of modern Kansas and 
                    Oklahoma. After varying periods of conflict, truces were arranged 
                    and reduced the bloodshed, but also circumscribed each tribe's 
                    hunting territory. For the Comanche and Kiowa, the upshot 
                    was that their primary range became the region south of the 
                    Arkansas River, between the Sangre de Cristo and Sacramento 
                    mountain ranges on the west and the Cross Timbers on the east. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text"> This was excellent bison-hunting country, as 
                    far as it went. Winters were relatively mild and the bison 
                    had roamed as far south as the Rio Grande in historic times. 
                    But the southern range was also fragile, subject to extremes 
                    of heat and drought that scorched the grasses and dried up 
                    the water courses. In such conditions, the bison could leave 
                    the range altogether, as they appear to have done in the late 
                    1780s, when for three successive years the Comanche had to 
                    go into the New Mexico pueblos and towns to beg for corn. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Tree ring data appear to validate Kiowa calendars 
                    that indicate long periods of diminished rainfall between 
                    1845 and 1875. The calendars note several summers of drought 
                    or dust during those years, and corresponding times of &quot;little 
                    buffalo&quot; or &quot;no buffalo .&quot; Only twice after 
                    1840 do the calendars include the observation, &quot;many 
                    buffalo.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text"> Within their restricted hunting territory, 
                    the Comanche and Kiowa also had to contend with transgressors, 
                    the New Mexican ciboleros who ventured onto the plains to 
                    hunt for bison. Although early Spanish expeditions had engaged 
                    in acts of wholesale slaughter&#151;one foray with the Jumano 
                    Indians in 1683 killed about 8,000 animals along the Concho 
                    River of Texas&#151;the ciboleros appear not to have become 
                    an important phenomenon until the 1800s. One account in the 
                    1830s estimated that the New Mexicans were killing a minimum 
                    of 10,000 to 12,000 bison annually. Their activities angered 
                    the Cheyenne, who drove them off their hunting grounds in 
                    the 1850s. This in turn brought them into confrontations with 
                    the Comanche and Kiowa after the Civil War, when they were 
                    reported to be having such a significant effect on the bison 
                    herds on the Llano Estacado that Army commanders in New Mexico 
                    considered banning their hunts.</p>
                  <p class="text">The uncertain political status of Texas and 
                    the other former Confederate states at war's end offered perhaps 
                    the last best hope for the Plains tribes to maintain their 
                    traditional way of life. In the fall of 1865, several Comanche 
                    and Kiowa leaders entered into what became known as the Treaty 
                    of the Little Arkansas River. Representatives of the government 
                    of the United States pledged to set aside a huge reserve that 
                    comprised most of the western half of modern Oklahoma, all 
                    of the Texas panhandle, and the remainder of the Llano Estacado 
                    east of the Texas-New Mexico border. </p>
                  <p> <span class="text">The Texas portion of the reserve had 
                    been land that few white men had wanted to cross, much less 
                    own, but it had also been state land, outside the control 
                    of the U.S. government. Within two years the government reneged 
                    on the treaty, obtained the signatures of Comanche and Kiowa 
                    leaders on the new Treaty of Medicine Lodge Creek, and reduced 
                    the reserve to only six per cent of its original size. All 
                    that remained was a corner of the designated &quot;Indian 
                    Territory.&quot; The substantial portion of the bison range 
                    that would at least in theory have been off limits to whites 
                    was left open to the commercial slaughter that touched off 
                    the Red River War of 1874-1875.</span></p>
                  <p class="text"> The last of the independent Comanche, Kiowa, 
                    and Kiowa Apache surrendered to reservation life in 1875. 
                    Some of the Lipan and Mescalero bands held out in northern 
                    Mexico until the early 1880s, when Mexican and U.S. Army forces 
                    drove them onto reservations or into extinction. The 1890 
                    Census showed 1,598 Comanche at the Fort Sill reservation, 
                    which they shared with 1,140 Kiowa and 326 Kiowa Apache. The 
                    Fort Stanton reservation in New Mexico had 473 Mescalero and 
                    40 Lipan. Few individuals from the once-great forest and prairie 
                    village groups had survived in Indian Territory, 536 of the

                  <p class="text">The Anglo-Texans' beleaguered former Indian 
                    allies did not fare even that well. The small Tonkawa village 
                    that grew up near Fort Griffin in the 1870s took in a small 
                    Lipan band before the post closed in 1881. In 1890, only 56 
                    Tonkawa had survived the tribe's second removal from Texas. 
                    They were joined in Indian Territory by 20 Lipan. <br>
                    <br>
                    The U.S. government adopted a new Indian policy in 1887, one 
                    calculated to destroy the remaining tribal organizations. 
                    The Dawes Act&#151;also known as the &quot;allotment&quot; 
                    or &quot;severalty&quot; act&#151;provided for the breakup 
                    of the reservations, with each head of a reservation family 
                    being allotted 160 acres, each single adult 80 acres, and 
                    each minor 40 acres. </p>
                  <p class="text">The former Texas Indian tribes reached the end 
                    of a long and deadly road at the beginning of the 20th Century. 
                    The impact of the Dawes Act is amply illustrated by the allotment 
                    of the Comanche-Kiowa reservation lands in 1901. About 440,000 
                    acres were allotted to the 2,759 individual members of the 
                    Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache tribes, and about 550,000 
                    acres were reserved for tribal use. The remaining 2 million 
                    acres of the nearly 3 million-acre reservation were opened 
                    to white settlement. </p>
                  <p class="text">In 1906, the secretary of the interior sold 
                    all but about 70,000 acres of the pasture that had been set 
                    aside for the common use of the Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa 
                    Apache. They had still been fearsome warriors in 1867, when 
                    they met the U.S. peace commissioners at Medicine Lodge Creek 
                    and bargained for the best future they could convince the 
                    government to let them keep. </p>
