                  <p class="text">For longer than any Comanche could remember, 
                    the summer had been a time of eager anticipation. It was the 
                    time when preparations would begin for the great communal 
                    bison hunts&#151;when whole villages would pack their tipis, 
                    ride out from the sheltering canyons of the Caprock, and find 
                    the great beasts that sustained the Comanche way of life.</p>
                  <p class="text">But not this time.</p>
                  <p class="text">On June 2, 1875, the Quahadi chief Quanah Parker 
                    led some 400 of the war-weary Comanche people into Fort Sill, 
                    Indian Territory. This time, they carried only a few possessions 
                    on their trek. This time, they would give up their weapons 
                    and their remaining ponies. It was their last act as The People 
                    they had been.</p>
                  <p class="text">Their time was finished. Now they, and their 
                    way, would surrender to the dictates of the whites. Now they 
                    would hunt the bison only with permission, but even that time, 
                    too, would soon be gone.</p>
                  <p class="text">Quanah's life story has become the stuff of 
                    Texas lore and legend. It begins in 1836 with the abduction 
                    of Cynthia Ann Parker, the young white girl who would one 
                    day become a Comanche wife and mother, who would later be 
                    recaptured by Texas Rangers, and who would die hopeless, unable 
                    either to see her Indian sons or to again become &quot;white.&quot; 
                    It ends in 1911 with Quanah Parker&#151;wealthy rancher, successful 
                    businessman, deputy sheriff&#151;buried in full Comanche regalia.</p>
                  <p class="text">Cynthia Ann would be reburied next to Quanah, 
                    mother and son rejoined at last after more than 50 years. 
                    But as its final irony, this essentially Texas story ends 
                    in an Oklahoma cemetery. In the end, Texas would not be Indian 
                    territory, not even for Quanah Parker.</p>
                  <p class="text">The mythic dimensions of Quanah's story obscure 
                    the hard reality of the war along the Texas frontier. It was 
                    a conflict waged brutally and relentlessly, with &quot;civilians&quot; 
                    on both sides targeted as readily as soldiers and warriors, 
                    no quarter expected and none given. The pattern was already 
                    taking form by the mid-1830s. The attack on the Parker family 
                    compound left five white men dead, several women brutalized 
                    and left for dead, two other young women and three children 
                    carried away, among them Cynthia Ann, not yet a teenager.</p>
                  <p class="text">The attack traumatized the Anglos, and galvanized 
                    them as well. Mirabeau B. Lamar, second president of the Republic 
                    of Texas, declared the policy of his administration in 1839. 
                    &quot;The white man and the red man cannot dwell in harmony 
                    together,&quot; Lamar said. &quot;Nature forbids it.&quot; 
                    His solution was &quot;to push a rigorous war against them; 
                    pursuing them to their hiding places without mitigation or 
                    compassion, until they shall be made to feel that flight from 
                    our borders without hope of return, is preferable to the scourges 
                    of war.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Lamar was the architect of the first Texas attempt to accomplish 
                    what the government of the United States called &quot;removal,&quot; 
                    the deportation of Indian tribes to places beyond the reach 
                    of white settlers. As pursued by the United States, the policy 
                    assumed there could be such a thing as a permanent Indian 
                    frontier&#151;a line beyond which the various &quot;removed&quot; 
                    tribes would be able to carry on their lives free from white 
                    encroachment.</p>
                  <p class="text">The United States had removed some 50,000 Indians 
                    from lands in the east to unorganized territory west of the 
                    Mississippi River. This opened approximately 100 million acres 
                    of eastern land to white settlement. To enforce the removal 
                    and, in theory, to protect the Indians in their new lands, 
                    a series of military posts was laid out on a roughly north-to-south 
                    line from a point on the upper Mississippi in present Minnesota 
                    to points near the Red River in present southeastern Oklahoma.</p>
                  <p class="text">Unlike the U.S. government, however, Texas had 
                    no lands it was willing to set aside for the Indians. In Lamar's 
                    thinking, they would simply be driven beyond the Red River, 
                    where they would become the problem and responsibility of 
                    the United States.</p>
                  <p class="text">To this end, John Henry Moore took a company 
                    of about 60 settlers from the vicinity of LaGrange and in 
                    January, 1839, rode up the Colorado River past its confluence 
                    with the Llano to look for Comanches. Already a veteran of 
                    more than 10 years of Texas frontier warfare, Moore included 
                    in his force the Lipan chief Castro and a group of his warriors, 
                    acting as scouts.</p>
                  <p class="text">Moore led a dismounted attack into a surprised 
                    Comanche camp near the San Saba River, where his men killed 
                    a number of warriors in their teepees, and scattered the rest. 
                    But the Comanches regrouped, stole the attackers' horses, 
                    and escaped. The Lipans departed in disgust, leaving Moore 
                    and his men to a dangerous retreat down the Colorado on foot.<br>

                  <p class="text">Similar encounters occurred later in the year. 
                    One, an expedition to the Little River, resulted in the deaths 
                    of Captain John Bird, four other rangers, and an estimated 
                    25 to 35 Indians. Although these expeditions served mostly 
                    to keep the frontier in a state of turmoil, they contributed 
                    to the southern Comanche bands requesting negotiations with 
                    the whites. The site for the talks was San Antonio, and the 
                    resulting debacle would assure that Comanches and Anglo-Texans 
                    would never live together in peace.</p>
                  <p class="text">The whites had demanded that the Comanches bring 
                    in their white captives&#151;believed to number about 200&#151;as 
                    a sign of good faith in the peace talks. The Comanches expected 
                    to barter for the return of each captive, one at a time. This 
                    was unacceptable to the whites, who became infuriated by the 
                    physical condition of the one white captive who was brought 
                    in, a 16-year-old girl.</p>
                  <p class="text">When white soldiers attempted to arrest the 
                    Comanche negotiators, a fight erupted inside the government 
                    building where the talks were being held, then spilled out 
                    into the street. Of the 65 or so Comanche men, women, and 
                    children caught in the melee, not one escaped. Twelve chiefs 
                    were killed. Six whites, including the county sheriff and 
                    a visiting judge, also were killed. About 30 of the Comanche 
                    women and children survived and were taken prisoner.</p>
                  <p class="text">One Comanche woman was sent to the Indian camp 
                    outside San Antonio to deliver the demands: Bring in all white 
                    captives within 12 days, or all the Comanche hostages would 
                    die.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Comanche reaction was outrage at the whites' 
                    treachery. To the Comanche, such negotiations were protected, 
                    not to be violated. They tortured and killed most of the 13 
                    captives in their camp, then returned to the prairies without 
                    those of their own people still held in San Antonio. Although 
                    those hostages ultimately escaped or were exchanged by the 
                    whites, the &quot;Council House Fight&quot; would burn in 
                    the Comanche memory. From that point forward, the history 
                    of Comanche-white relations in Texas would be mostly a cyclical 
                    pattern of raid and retaliation.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Linnville raid in August, 1840, was unprecedented 
                    in Anglo-Texan experience. Buffalo Hump, an important chief 
                    of the southern Comanche bands after the Council House Fight, 
                    led a force estimated as numbering between 600 and 1,000, 
                    including families of the warriors. The Comanches left some 
                    15 white settlers and black slaves dead in Victoria en route 
                    to Linnville, on the Gulf coast. There they ransacked the 
                    town and killed three whites and two blacks. Most of the residents 
                    who survived did so by taking to the water in boats.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Indians turned northwest toward their home 
                    range, driving a herd of 2,000 to 3,000 stolen horses by the 
                    time they reached the Plum Creek prairie southeast of Austin. 
                    There they met a force of Texas militia, rangers, civilian 
                    volunteers, and Tonkawa scouts under chief Placido. In the 
                    running fight that followed, some 80 Comanche warriors were 
                    killed in the space of about 15 miles. One white man died. 
                    The Tonkawas received citations for bravery.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although the audacity of the raid had cost the 
                    Comanches dearly, they were not through paying. The following 
                    month, Moore again led a force up the Colorado River, this 
                    time well beyond the San Saba. With some 90 white men and 
                    12 Lipans, he again struck a Comanche camp at dawn, this time 
                    on horseback. The Comanches lost about 125 dead. Moore's report 
                    indicated that the number included many shot down as they 
                    tried to run, women and children among them.</p>
                  <p class="text">Such events would recur many times in the coming 
                    decades.</p>
                  <p class="text">When Texas joined the Union, nearly 10 years 
                    had passed since Cynthia Ann Parker had been taken from her 
                    family by Indian raiders. White settlement had moved north 
                    and west, out of the woodlands and onto the prairies. But 
                    nothing about the frontier experience had changed. Nowhere 
                    else on the Great Plains were red and white-occupied lands 
                    in such proximity. Nowhere was the conflict between these 
                    two cultures more brutal. And nowhere would it last longer.
