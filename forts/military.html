                  <p class="text">The annexation of Texas and the acquisition 
                    of the Southwest following the war against Mexico posed significant 
                    challenges for the United States army in the west. Previously, 
                    idealistic policy-makers had assumed that expansion would 
                    occur from east to west, in a gradual, predictable process. 
                    To protect this westward movement, the army had attempted 
                    to establish military posts at strategic points. Indians would 
                    be relocated west of these garrisons. Separating the two groups 
                    might limit the opportunity for mischief on both sides. Some 
                    had even envisioned a north/south military road dividing the 
                    two peoples, further reducing the potential for conflict. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">In practice, the War Department had never fully 
                    implemented these plans. The army never had enough troops 
                    to be everywhere at once, and political and economic pressures 
                    rather than sound military principles often dictated the location 
                    of frontier posts. In any event, the new western realities 
                    shattered traditional thinking. </p>
                  <p class="text">Lured by the discovery of gold in California, 
                    tens of thousands of civilians rushed west, ruining any hopes 
                    of an orderly American occupation of the newly acquired territories. 
                    And in Texas, the army had to position its troops not only 
                    to face Indians from the west and north, but to protect the 
                    international border with Mexico. Furthermore, the Lone Star 
                    state's ownership of its public lands prevented the federal 
                    government from establishing large Indian reservations in 
                    the western part of the state, save for an unsuccessful attempt 
                    to carve out two enclaves on the Brazos River between 1854-1859.</p>

                    and Maj. Gen. George Mercer Brooke, vice Brig Gen., (1849-51), 
                    began the work of confirming United States authority along 
                    the southern and western frontiers of Texas. Along the lower 
                    Rio Grande, Forts Polk and Brown had been established during 
                    the war against Mexico; to these, Brooke added Ringgold Barracks, 
                    Fort McIntosh, and Fort Duncan. </p>

                        <p class="text">To protect the western frontier, Forts 
                          Inge, Lincoln, Martin Scott, Croghan, Gates, Graham, 
                          and Worth were erected on Brooke's watch. Following 
                          the general's death in 1851, his successor, Brevet Maj. 
                          Gen. Persifor F. Smith, added Forts Ewell and Merrill 
                          in South Texas. Pushing the military line further west, 
                          Smith authorized construction of Forts Clark, Terrett, 
                          Mason, McKavett, Chadbourne, Phantom Hill, and Belknap. 
                          To help plug gaps in the northwest, Camp Cooper was 
                          erected in 1856. A double line of forts now protected 
                          Texas' southern and western frontiers.</p>
                  <p class="text">On paper, the scheme looked grand indeed. Posts 
                    would be located in areas where there was access to good water, 
                    forage, and construction materials. The troops themselves 
                    would do much of the building, thus holding construction costs 
                    to a minimum. Since Indians almost never attacked the forts, 
                    no defensive walls were necessary. Infantry based on the outer 
                    cordon of the Worth-Brooke-Smith defensive line would alert 
                    mounted troops, stationed in the inner line to reduce the 
                    high costs of their upkeep, of the presence of Indians or 
                    outlaws in their midst. </p>
                  <p class="text">In reality, the forts were too far apart and 
                    their garrisons too small (in 1860, for instance, the fourteen 
                    military posts in Texas had an average strength of just less 
                    than ninety men each) to completely patrol the immensity of 
                    the Lone Star state. As one traveler put it upon observing 
                    a frontier garrison, &quot;a parade of the entire force would 
                    sometimes diminish our feeling of security.&quot; Finding 
                    Indians deemed hostile by the government was difficult enough; 
                    forcing them to fight often seemed impossible to soldiers 
                    bewildered by their enemies' mobility, knowledge of the terrain, 
                    and tactical sagacity. Some posts were poorly situated; inadequate 
                    water supplies at Phantom Hill and Belknap, for example, forced 
                    their abandonment. </p>
                  <p class="text">Furthermore, the plans provided no protection 
                    for the tenuous overland routes to Chihuahua, Santa Fe, and 
                    California. To shield these vital lines, Fort Bliss, first 
                    established in 1849, was reactivated five years later. Fort 
                    Davis (1854), Fort Lancaster (1855), Camp Hudson (1856), Camp 
                    Verde (1856), Fort Quitman (1858), and Fort Stockton (1859) 
                    followed thereafter. </p>

                    Forts Polk, Gates, Lincoln, Croghan, Graham, Worth, Terrett, 
                    Ewell, and Merrill were soon rendered obsolete. </p>
                  <p class="text">Texas' declaration of secession in early 1861 
                    caught federal military officials off guard. Although members 
                    of several garrisons made their way to the safety of New Mexico, 
                    the Indian territory, Kansas, or were evacuated from coastal 
                    ports, nearly four hundred troops from stations west of San 
                    Antonio were forced to surrender to state authorities. Texas 
                    or Confederate troops occupied several of the abandoned posts, 
                    especially in northwest Texas, but Indians burned and looted 
                    some of the others, such as Fort Davis. In the absence of 
                    federal troops, some Texans tried to defend themselves by 
                    &quot;forting up&quot; in rude blockhouses or walled positions.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War 
                    in mid-1865, military officials were more interested in reinstalling 
                    federal authority in Texas than they were in reestablishing 
                    the army's presence on the state's sparsely settled frontiers. 
                    &quot;Texas has not yet suffered from the war and will require 
                    some intimidation,&quot; asserted Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, 
                    military commander of Texas and Louisiana. But as reports 
                    of depredations attributed to Indians escalated, in 1866-67 
                    the regulars in blue began marching west. The army once again 
                    occupied Forts Bliss, Clark, Davis, McIntosh, Ringgold, and 
                    Stockton, which became stalwarts of the post-Civil War frontier 
                    system. </p>
                  <p class="text">By contrast, the federals only briefly returned 
                    to Lancaster, Belknap, Martin Scott, Mason, Inge, Chadbourne, 
                    Hudson, and Verde. In their stead came newer positions, further 
                    west and north&#151;Forts Richardson, Concho, Elliott, and 
                    Griffin. Many garrisons also tended sub-posts to help them 
                    patrol the long, sparsely settled distances of west Texas; 
                    in some cases, such as the Fort Davis subposts of Camp Pena 
                    Colorado and Fort Hancock, these former sub-posts evolved 
                    into semi-permanent forts that outlived their mother bases.</p>

                  <p class="text">Frontier forts served as bases from which scouts, 
                    pursuits, large-scale offensives, and escorts or guards were 
                    launched. Before the Civil War, most common was combat resulting 
                    from a successful pursuit, triggered by information gleaned 
                    by post or detachment commanders that Indians had been discovered. 
                    Following the war, however, most engagements stemmed from 
                    routine scouts, sent to interdict likely avenues of approach 
                    or widely used trails or waterholes. </p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the successful large-scale expeditions, 
                    involving several companies engaged in campaigns that were 
                    projected to take longer and involve greater distances, also 
                    came after 1865. Combat involving mail parties, stagecoaches, 
                    and construction teams accounted for less than 10 percent 
                    of all engagements. The overwhelming majority of the fights 
                    were short and badly fragmented skirmishes involving about 
                    three dozen combatants per side. Sixty-four soldiers were 
                    killed and 116 wounded during these clashes; the army reported 
                    424 Indians killed, 112 wounded, and 267 taken prisoner.</p>
                  <p class="text">Assessing the true military effectiveness of 
                    the frontier forts in Texas is difficult. As historian Robert 
                    Utley has noted, many officers saw the wars against the Indians 
                    as a &quot;fleeting bother,&quot; not worthy of the time or 
                    energy it would take to develop tactics or strategy suitable 
                    to such conflicts. Successful officers developed methods through 
                    personal observation, by trial and error, by word of mouth, 
                    or by individual ingenuity rather than through recognized 
                    army doctrine. </p>
                  <p class="text">The vast majority of scouts, pursuits, and large-scale 
                    campaigns found no Indians. Pointing to the futility of such 
                    efforts, Texans often charged that the federal government 
                    never devoted sufficient resources to their state. Although 
                    such claims often made for good politics with the folks back 
                    home, in reality Texas probably exceeded its fair share of 
                    War Department resources; in 1856, for example, fully twenty-five 
                    percent of the entire army was based in Texas. More telling, 
                    if less politically popular, was the argument that the army 
                    was simply too small to carry out all the responsibilities 
                    expected of it. In addition to fighting Indians, regulars 
                    garrisoned coastal defensive fortifications, provided assistance 
                    to civilians in times of crisis, helped to maintain domestic 
                    order, patrolled national parks, conducted scientific research, 
                    and engaged in civil engineering jobs. The chronic shortage 
                    of mounted troops exacerbated the army's difficulties.</p>
                  <p class="text">Despite these shortfalls, the frontier forts 
                    had an enormous impact on Texas history. As one observer exclaimed, 
                    army forts served &quot;as the oasis in the desert&quot; for 
                    many a weary traveler. The forts also provided a tremendous 
                    economic stimulus. From 1849 to 1900, the army disbursed some 
                    $70 million in Texas, an amount equivalent to more than twice 
                    the valuation of all the assessed property in the state at 
                    the time of its annexation. And with the army often came schools, 
                    churches, roads, and surveys. </p>
                  <p class="text">Offering jobs, profits, a modicum of American 
                    culture, the army's forts often served as the genesis for 
                    permanent civilian settlement, resulting in new towns like 
                    San Angelo, Gatesville, Fort Davis, Fort Stockton, and Fort 
                    Worth. Their presence also boosted the chances of existing 
                    sites like San Antonio (usually the site of department headquarters), 
                    Eagle Pass, Brownsville, and El Paso. As a legendary Texas 
                    historian once put it, &quot;No story of the Texas heritage 
                    can be complete without telling the role its forts played 
                    in making that heritage possible.&quot;</p>
