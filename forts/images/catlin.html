      <h3>Observations by George Catlin, Great Camanchee (sic) Village, Texas 
      </h3>
      <p><em>Amongst their feats of riding, there is one that astonishes me more 
        than anything of the kind that I have ever seen, or expect to see in my 
        life:--a strategem of war, learned and practiced by every young man in 
        the tribe; by which he is able to drop his body upon the side of the horse 
        at the instant he is passing, effectively screened from his enemies' weapons 
        as he lies in a horizontal position behind the body of his horse, with 
        his heel hanging over the horse's back; by which he has the power of throwing 
        himself up again, and changing to the other side of the horse if necessary. 
        In this wonderful condition, he will hang whilst his horse is at fullest 
        speed, carrying with him his bow and shield, and also his long lance of 
        fourteen feet in length, all or either of which he will wield upon his 
        enemy as he passes; rising and throwing his arrows over the horse's back, 
        or with equal ease and equal success under the horse's neck. This astonishing 
        feat, which the young men have repeatedly been playing off to our surprise 
        as well as amusement, whilst they have been galloping away in front of 
        our tents, completely puzzled the whole of us; and appeared to be the 
        result of magic, rather than skills acquired by practice&#133;.</em></p>
      <p>From <em>The North American Indians</em>, Vol. II, by George Catlin, published 
        in 1926 by John Grant, Edinburgh. </p>
