                          Indians discovered a packet of illustrated newspapers, 
                          which they reportedly found absorbing. The sudden appearance 
                          of soldiers on the scene led the Indians to ascribe 
                          magical powers to the newspapers. Drawing courtesy National

                  <br><p class="text">The Davis Mountains are an almost lush, alpine 
                    oasis rising from the surrounding desert. Nearly out of view 
                    from modern Interstate Highway 10, these peaks may escape 
                    the notice of westbound travelers impatient to reach El Paso, 
                    200 miles away. But the U.S. Army engineers who passed through 
                    the Trans-Pecos in 1849 took careful note of what they found 
                    here. <br>
                    <br>
                    Lieutenants W.H.C. Whiting and William F. Smith had been sent 
                    from San Antonio to find a practicable wagon route west. After 
                    several days spent looking for drinkable water west of the 
                    Pecos River, Whiting must have felt a great sense of relief 
                    upon finding a small stream in a mountain canyon. His reaction 
                    to the discovery was almost lyrical: he named the little brook 
                    the &quot;Limpia,&quot; while a two-mile passage among the 
                    mountains became &quot;Wild Rose Pass.&quot; His party's resting 
                    place was &quot;Painted Comanche Camp,&quot; so named because 
                    of pictographs that adorned nearby cottonwood trees.<br>
                    <br>
                    Whiting and Smith ultimately recommended that the army build 
                    a road through the pass, in what would be known for a time 
                    as the Limpia Mountains. It became the army's preferred route 
                    through the Trans-Pecos, and hundreds of emigrants bound for 
                    the California gold fields were soon traveling it. In 1851, 
                    frontiersman Henry Skillman began using the road for his mail 
                    service between San Antonio and Santa Fe. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Travel in the Trans-Pecos was dangerous. Mescalero 
                    Apaches inhabited the mountains through which the road passed. 
                    Comanche and Kiowa raiders sweeping down from the High Plains 
                    crossed the road on their way to their favorite raiding targets 
                    in northern Mexico. By mid-1854, it was plain that the army 
                    needed posts to protect the route.</p>
                  <p class="text"> General Persifor F. Smith, departmental commander, 
                    set out from San Antonio in September to look into the problem 
                    and find a site for a post. Smith stopped at the Painted Comanche 
                    Camp, where he was joined by Lieutenant Colonel Washington 
                    Seawell and the six companies of the 8th Infantry that would 
                    garrison the new installation. It was to be called Fort Davis, 
                    in honor of the United States secretary of war, Jefferson 
                    Davis. General Smith personally selected the location for 
                    the fort, a spot about a quarter of a mile from the camp, 
                    surrounded on three sides by the sheer rock cliffs of a canyon.</p>
                  <p class="text"> A stand of timber was found in the mountains 
                    about 25 miles from away, and Sewell soon had the soldiers 
                    hauling logs and cutting planks for living quarters and other 
                    buildings. Six shelters, one for each company, were erected 
                    across the mouth of the canyon. They were made of oak and 
                    cottonwood pickets and measured 20 feet wide and 56 feet long. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Within two years, these were converted to kitchens 
                    and mess rooms. New stone barracks with thatched roofs were 
                    erected to the east, in a line parallel with the original 
                    structures. Other stone buildings were a bakehouse, blacksmith 
                    shop, and warehouse. Additional structures were built further 
                    up the canyon to the west. These were made of wood planks, 
                    set into the earth on end, picket style, with plank or earthen 
                    floors and thatched grass or canvas roofs. They included 11 
                    sets of officers' quarters and a two-room house for the commanding 
                    officer. A hospital, adjutant's office, housing for married 
                    soldiers and their families, storehouses, a stable, a sawmill, 
                    and a sutler's store made Fort Davis one of the army's most 
                    extensive western posts.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The San Antonio-El Paso mail enterprise was 
                    being reorganized even as General Smith was issuing his order 
                    for establishment of Fort Davis. Skillman and George Giddings 
                    entered into a partnership to provide mail and passenger service, 
                    and constructed &quot;La Limpia Station&quot; a mile from 
                    the army encampment. This provided the stage drivers a place 
                    to obtain a fresh team of mules, the line's first relief station 
                    west of the Pecos River.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Additional stations were established at Live 
                    Oak Creek, where the army placed Fort Lancaster in 1855; in 
                    Quitman Canyon, where Fort Quitman was established in 1858; 
                    and at Comanche Springs, where the army began erecting Fort 
                    Stockton in 1859. Intermediate stations were built between 
                    the various army posts throughout the 1850s.</p>
                  <p class="text"> The availability of replacement mules made 
                    it possible for the coaches to travel the road more quickly 
                    and more frequently, but the relief stations and their corrals 
                    also were magnets for Apaches and Comanches. The army could 
                    provide little protection, and Skillman and Giddings experienced 
                    a disastrous year in 1858. In January, La Limpia was raided 
                    and all its stock was stolen, and the El Muerto and Van Horn's 
                    Wells stations were both destroyed. Raids on Comanche Springs 
                    and Lancaster, and another on La Limpia, followed during the 
                    spring. The stations at Escondido Springs and Eagle Springs 
                    were destroyed in the fall. In 1859, the Trans-Pecos stations 
                    suffered 10 more similar attacks.</p>

                    abandoned Fort Davis and the other Texas posts. A Confederate 
                    invasion force bound for New Mexico passed by the post, and 
                    one company of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles under Lieutenant 
                    Reuben E. Mays was left there as a garrison. In August, 1861, 
                    the Mescalero chief Nicholas led a raid on the fort. Mays 
                    and 14 other Confederate soldiers pursued the Indians into 
                    the Big Bend country and died in an ambush. Only the party's 
                    Mexican guide escaped. </p>
                  <p class="text">After the New Mexico expedition was repulsed, 
                    Confederate forces withdrew from western Texas. A Federal 
                    cavalry detachment visited Fort Davis in August, 1862, found 
                    most of the buildings in disrepair, and left the next day. 
                    The remains of the post lay empty for the next five years.</p>
                  <p class="text">The end of the Civil War brought renewed activity 
                    to the Trans-Pecos. Re-opening of stagecoach operations between 
                    San Antonio and El Paso, and the advent of cattle trailing 
                    from Texas to New Mexico by way of the Pecos River, drew the 
                    U.S. Army back to Fort Davis. Four companies of the 9th Cavalry 
                    commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Wesley Merritt rode into the 
                    battered post in June, 1867. Merritt immediately began a significant 
                    rebuilding project, and employed some 200 civilian carpenters, 
                    masons, and semi-skilled laborers for the task. </p>
                  <p class="text">Merritt relocated the heart of the fort outside 
                    the canyon, on a plain below the mountains. Two years of construction 
                    work resulted in new officers' quarters and enlisted men's 
                    barracks. In 1869, the departmental quartermaster ordered 
                    construction halted, and additional work was done only sporadically 
                    through the 1870s. </p>
                  <p class="text">Lieutenant Colonel William R. Shafter, 24th 
                    Infantry, took command at Fort Davis in May, 1871. &quot;Pecos 
                    Bill&quot; was known equally well for his excessive weight 
                    and surprising energy, and in June he turned what could have 
                    been an unremarkable pursuit into a three-week expedition 
                    through the trackless Monahans Sand Hills and other unexplored 
                    parts of the northern Trans-Pecos. In October, he led two 
                    companies of the 9th Cavalry and one of the 25th Infantry 
                    on a similar sweep of the desert and mountains of what today 
                    is Big Bend National Park. </p>
                  <p class="text">The principal Mescalero bands went onto the 
                    Fort Stanton, New Mexico, reservation in September, 1871. 
                    Apart from a flare-up of Indian raiding in 1873, the Trans-Pecos 
                    was comparatively quiet during the mid-1870s, but hostilities 
                    intensified by the end of the decade. The Mescalero became 
                    restive on their reservation, and some escaped to the Guadalupe 
                    Mountains or the Big Bend. Others used the reservation as 
                    a sanctuary to raid in New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">The army responded by focusing special attention 
                    on the Trans-Pecos. General Edward O.C. Ord, commanding the 
                    Department of Texas, created a new District of the Pecos under 
                    Colonel Benjamin H. Grierson, who at the time had his 10th 
                    Cavalry headquarters at Fort Concho. With his &quot;buffalo 
                    soldiers,&quot; and their 24th and 25th Infantry brethren, 
                    Grierson embarked on a two-year campaign against the Apaches. 
                    He established two sub-posts of Fort Concho, two of Fort Stockton, 
                    and three of Fort Davis. The Fort Davis sub-posts were at 
                    Seven Springs, the stagecoach station at Eagle Springs, and 
                    John Butterfield's abandoned Overland Mail station at Pine 
                    Springs in the Guadalupe Mountains. </p>
                  <p class="text">The effort came none too soon. Indians killed 
                    14 persons in the District of the Pecos during the first six 
                    months of 1878, and in August attacked the El Muerto stagecoach 
                    station, killed a driver, and stole all of the station's livestock. 
                    Grierson's troopers scoured the Trans-Pecos. The three 10th 
                    Cavalry companies stationed at Fort Davis logged 6,742 scouting 
                    miles in 1878, the most for any post in the Department of 
                    Texas that year.</p>

                  <br><p class="text">A brief period of relative calm was broken in 
                    August, 1879, when the Warm Springs Apache leader Victorio 
                    and some followers fled the Mescalero reservation near Fort 
                    Stanton. Victorio and the Warm Springs Apache had left the 
                    San Carlos, Arizona, reservation in 1877 and had alternately 
                    raided and relented, before agreeing to settle at Fort Stanton. 
                    Victorio's last break-out was the beginning of the army's 
                    last Indian campaign in Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">In September, 1879, Victorio's band attacked 
                    a company of the 9th Cavalry in New Mexico, killed or wounded 
                    eight troopers, and escaped with 46 horses. The Apaches killed 
                    nine civilians in the next week, and spent most of the next 
                    nine months in deadly raids on civilians on both sides of 
                    the Mexican border and in skirmishes with the U.S.Army in 
                    New Mexico. While the 9th Cavalry chased Victorio through 
                    western New Mexico, Grierson took five companies of the 10th 
                    Cavalry and a detachment of 25th Infantry to help disarm the 
                    Fort Stanton Mescaleros in April, 1880.</p>
                  <p class="text">After having returned to Texas&#151;and believing

                    joined four companies of the 24th Infantry. He then spread 
                    his forces among the water holes and mountain passes of the 
                    Trans-Pecos, and headed to the theater of action himself.</p>

                    Three companies of reinforcements helped turn back the Apaches 
                    after a four-hour battle. Seven days later, Grierson and four 
                    companies of the 10th Cavalry blocked Victorio's access to 
                    the water at Rattlesnake Springs. After retiring to the mountains, 
                    the Apaches attacked an approaching army supply train, but 
                    were driven back by a company of the 24th Infantry and a detachment 
                    of cavalry.</p>
                  <p class="text">In the interval between the battles at Tinaja 
                    de las Palmas and Rattlesnake Springs, another 10th Cavalry 
                    detatchment attacked the Apaches' supply camp and destroyed 
                    most of their provisions. Denied passage through Texas and 
                    low on food and water, Victorio withdrew across the Rio Grande 
                    to find refuge in Mexico. Although he had used the Chihuahuan 
                    mountains as a lair for years, Victorio survived only two 
                    more months before being cornered by Mexican soldiers who 
                    killed him and most of his band.</p>
                  <p class="text">The army did not mount another major campaign 
                    against Indians in Texas, but Fort Davis would continue to 
                    represent a major investment throughout the 1880s. Grierson 
                    moved his headquarters there in 1882, and he supervised a 
                    program of expansion and improvement of the physical facilities 
                    during the three years he and the 10th Cavalry remained. </p>

                    the addition of a second ward. New stone and adobe officers' 
                    quarters, cavalry barracks, infantry barracks and band barracks 
                    were other additions. An ice plant, a water system, and gas

                  <p class="text">The army abandoned Fort Davis in 1891, and the 
                    property reverted to civilian ownership. In 1906, the land 
                    and remaining buildings that had comprised the post were turned 
                    over to the United States Department of the Interior. In 1961, 
                    the post was authorized a national historic site, and in 1963 
                    it was open to the public. Today, the site features more than 
                    two dozen restored buildings and ruins of many more. </p>
