                  <br><p class="text">Much of the history of the Trans-Pecos region 
                    of southwestern Texas has been of peoples on their way to 
                    some place else. The Spanish mostly went around it. Comanche 
                    and Kiowa raiders rode through it from the north on their 
                    way to Mexico. Anglo-Americans came from the east, headed 
                    for the California gold fields and western cattle markets. 
                    In time, the travelers and their trails drew the attention 
                    of the United States Army. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Prehistoric peoples lived and traded along 
                    the middle Rio Grande&#151;named El Rio del Norte by the Spanish&#151;for 
                    thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. In 1535, 
                    the wandering Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca found Jumano and 
                    other native groups farming the land at the junction of the 
                    Rio Grande and the Rio Conchos&#151;la junta de los rios&#151;opposite 
                    the site of modern Presidio, Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">Two Spanish exploratory expeditions in the early 
                    1580s came down the Conchos, passed through la junta, turned 
                    northwest, and followed the Norte toward its upper reaches. 
                    In 1598, Juan de O&ntilde;ate was authorized to settle the 
                    lands within the modern boundaries of New Mexico. He traveled 
                    over the Chihuahuan plateau to reach the Rio Grande some 150 
                    miles upstream from la junta, and memorialized his crossing 
                    of the river as El Paso del Rio del Norte. He then followed 
                    the river to the pueblos of the north, where he settled his 
                    colonists and established the town of Santa Fe.</p>
                  <p class="text">O&ntilde;ate found the Puebloans trading with 
                    Plains Indians who brought buffalo robes to exchange for corn 
                    and other agricultural products. The outlanders&#151;the Spanish 
                    called them vaqueros because of their trade in &quot;cow&quot; 
                    hides&#151;were the Plains Apache. The center of this trade 
                    was the Pecos Pueblo, across the mountains to the east of 
                    Santa Fe and near the headwaters of the Pecos River.</p>
                  <p class="text">The province of Nuevo Mexico grew steadily, 
                    if somewhat slowly, but the harshness of a succession of Spanish 
                    governors led to an Indian revolt in 1680. The Spaniards withdrew 
                    to the south and took refuge near O&ntilde;ate's crossing 
                    of the Rio Grande. Their northward advance stymied, the Spanish 
                    began to dig in along the middle stretch of the river and 
                    to establish missions at the Paso del Norte and la junta. 
                    These missions remained after the Spanish returned to Santa 
                    Fe. In 1760, the Spanish would establish Presidio de la junta 
                    de los Rios Norte y los Conchos&#151;known more simply in 
                    later years as Presidio del Norte&#151;to protect the missions 
                    at the junction of the Rio Grande and Rio Conchos.</p>
                  <p class="text">The missionary efforts at la junta were plagued 
                    by Spanish slavers who captured local Indians and carried 
                    them south to work in the silver mines. Apaches who visited 
                    the Puebloans of New Mexico likewise were periodically abducted 
                    by the Spanish and transported to the interior of Mexico. 
                    When Comanches began to intrude on the Apache range in the 
                    early 1700s, they attacked the pueblos and the nearby New 
                    Mexican settlements. In desperation, the Spanish government 
                    in 1786 made an alliance with the Comanches in which they 
                    combined to make war against the Apaches. In addition to other 
                    terms, the Spanish New Mexicans offered the Comanches a horse 
                    and bridle and two knives for each Apache captive brought 
                    to Santa Fe. </p>
                  <p class="text">Throughout the remainder of the Spanish colonial 
                    period and 25-year interval of Mexican rule, the settlers 
                    of New Mexico were able to maintain relatively peaceful trade 
                    relations with the Comanche. But that peace was maintained 
                    at a tremendous cost that was paid by settlers in the northern 
                    Mexico provinces of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, and Zacatecas. 
                    As the Apache lost control of the Plains and scattered into 
                    the mountains of Mexico and the Trans-Pecos, the Comanche 
                    began to raid the Mexican settlements south of the Rio Grande. 
                    Captive Mexicans would be carried north, and some would be 
                    brought to the New Mexico settlements to be ransomed.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Comanche Trail from the High Plains into 
                    Mexico&#151;sometimes called the &quot;Comanche War Trail&quot; 
                    or the &quot;Comanche Trace&quot;&#151;is shrouded in legend 
                    and mystery. It appears not to have been one trail, but several 
                    that converged somewhere on the Plains or in the Trans-Pecos, 
                    passed by the prodigious springs at the present city of Fort 
                    Stockton, and diverged again to cross the Rio Grande at multiple 
                    points. Raiders following the upriver, or western, trails 
                    could strike at Chihuahua and Durango; those following the 
                    eastern branches could attack Coahuila and Zacatecas. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Mexicans' successful revolution against 
                    Spanish rule opened a new era of international trade along 
                    the famous Santa Fe Trail, which ran from Independence, Missouri, 
                    into northern New Mexico. From Santa Fe, the trade extended 
                    south through the Paso del Norte, and on to Chihuahua City. 
                    When the United States and Mexico went to war in 1846, one 
                    of the U.S. Army's invasion routes into Mexico followed the 
                    Santa Fe-Chihuahua Trail.</p>
                  <p class="text">After three years of war, the United States 
                    in 1848 obtained the land west of the new state of Texas&#151;the 
                    territory comprising the modern states of New Mexico, Arizona, 
                    and California. As word of discovery of gold in California 
                    began to reach the east, exploratory expeditions and immigrant 
                    parties began to enter the Trans-Pecos in search of a viable 
                    route to the Pacific. Texas rangers John C. Hays and Samuel 
                    Highsmith attempted to map such a road, but became hopelessly 
                    lost. They probably were saved only by fortuitously stumbling 
                    upon a trading post known as Fort Leaton. </p>
                  <p class="text">Chihuahua Trail freighter Ben Leaton had purchased 
                    property near la junta in 1848. He expanded upon existing 
                    structures to establish a home, trading post, and private 
                    fort. The Hays-Highsmith party recuperated at Leaton's place 
                    for 10 days before leaving for San Antonio, which they reached 
                    in December, 1848, and where they reported that they had found 
                    a practicable wagon route from San Antonio to the Presidio 
                    del Norte. </p>
                  <p class="text">Within two months after the return of the Hays-Highsmith 
                    party, U.S. Army lieutenants W.H.C. Whiting and William F. 
                    Smith departed San Antonio with orders to try to find a viable 
                    route west, using the dubious Hays-Highsmith experience to 
                    reach the Rio Grande at Presidio del Norte. The expedition 
                    first headed northwest, passing through the German settlement 
                    at Fredericksburg before reaching the San Saba River. It followed 
                    the San Saba to its headwaters, then headed west beyond the 
                    Pecos River and south to Fort Leaton. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Whiting-Smith party followed the Rio Grande 
                    northwest to the Paso del Norte, but decided to return on 
                    a more direct route that bypassed Fort Leaton and reached 
                    San Antonio by way of the Devil's River, Las Moras Springs, 
                    the Nueces River, and the Alsatian village of Castroville. 
                    Fort Leaton, believed to be the largest adobe structure in 
                    Texas, would eventually fade into obscurity. Ben Leaton died 
                    in 1851, but not before Mexican authorities accused him of 
                    selling guns to Comanches in return for stolen horses.</p>
                  <p class="text">By mid-1849, the army had plotted the wagon 
                    road that became known variously as the &quot;government,&quot; 
                    &quot;lower,&quot; or &quot;southern&quot; road west from 
                    San Antonio. In September, Captain Jefferson Van Horne and 
                    four companies of the 3rd Infantry traveled through the Trans-Pecos 
                    and established a camp at the ranch of Benjamin Franklin Coons, 
                    across the river from the Mexican town that had become known, 
                    simply, as &quot;El Paso.&quot; The army's post would be abandoned, 
                    relocated, and ultimately named Fort Bliss. The Anglo town 
                    that grew up across the river from Mexican El Paso would be 
                    known as &quot;Franklin.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">In the meantime, the army's and the public's 
                    desire for means of transcontinental communication and commerce 
                    was recognized by Henry Skillman, a veteran trader on the 
                    Santa Fe-Chihuahua Trail. In 1851 he was awarded a contract 
                    for U.S. mail service from San Antonio to Santa Fe via Franklin. 
                    By December, Skillman was offering passenger service. </p>
                  <p class="text">Skillman formed a partnership with George Giddings 
                    in 1854, and the two attempted to put the operation on a stronger 
                    financial footing. But the business would always be endangered 
                    by Lipan Apaches on the eastern end of the route, Mescalero 
                    Apaches in the mountains of the far western Trans-Pecos, and 
                    Comanches and Kiowas in between. In less than two years, the 
                    Giddings-Skillman operation lost more than $54,000 worth of 
                    livestock, wagons, and buildings to Indian attacks.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Two U. S. Army posts guarded the gateways from 
                    the interior of Texas into the Trans-Pecos. Fort McKavett, 
                    near the headwaters of the San Saba River, protected the &quot;upper&quot; 
                    road through Fredericksburg . Fort Clark, near the Rio Grande, 
                    protected the &quot;lower&quot; road through Castroville. 
                    But a similar military presence was needed farther west, and 
                    in 1854 the army established a post near Limpia Creek in the 
                    mountains of the Trans-Pecos. It was named Fort Davis, after 
                    United States secretary of war Jefferson Davis. The following 
                    year, Fort Lancaster was established on Live Oak Creek near 
                    its confluence with the Pecos River.</p>

                    Trail and the government road. The army also maintained a 
                    small post on the Devil's River, called Camp Hudson. </p>
                  <p class="text">The lack of water and forage in the region prompted 
                    one of the more unusual innovations in the army's history&#151;the 
                    use of camels for transportation. In 1855, the Congress appropriated 
                    $30,000 to import camels for military purposes. The first 
                    herd of 32 was sent to Camp Verde in the Hill Country west 
                    of San Antonio, and was followed by another group of 41. After 
                    a number of localized experiments, an expedition including 
                    25 camels departed for New Mexico to participate in an exploration 
                    of the Colorado River near California. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Traffic through the Trans-Pecos began to increase 
                    in the late 1850s. In 1857 the U.S. Postmaster awarded a mail 
                    contract to the Butterfield Overland Mail Company for service 
                    from St. Louis, Missouri to San Francisco, California. James 
                    Birch had competed for the contract, and his consolation prize 
                    was a contract for service from San Antonio to San Diego, 
                    California, by way of El Paso. Birch soon formed a partnership 
                    with Giddings, and Skillman was hired to help set up the line. 
                    The first mail from San Antonio to the Pacific reached San 
                    Diego in August.</p>

                  <p class="text">The route of the competing Butterfield line 
                    crossed northwestern Texas beyond Fort Worth and passed through 
                    Fort Belknap, Fort Phantom Hill, and Fort Chadbourne before 
                    reaching the Pecos River near the border with New Mexico. 
                    The route passed along the base of the Guadalupe Mountains 
                    on its way to Franklin. The portion of the route west of the 
                    Pecos was shifted south through Fort Stockton and Fort Davis 
                    in 1859. For the next two years, the Butterfield line and 
                    the Giddings line shared the government road through the Trans-Pecos 
                    to Franklin, which became the nucleus of the new Anglo town 
                    of El Paso. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The early 1860s brought a suspension of civilian 
                    travel in the Trans-Pecos. Texas seceded from the United States 
                    in February, 1861, and the Butterfield line abandoned its 
                    service through Texas the next month. The U.S. Army's Trans-Pecos 
                    forts were abandoned at the beginning of the Civil War. A 
                    column of California volunteer infantry reclaimed Fort Bliss 
                    for the United States in 1862, and Fort Quitman in 1863. </p>
                  <p class="text">The association of black soldiers with the army's 
                    defense of Texas' southwestern frontier began in 1867 with 
                    the arrival of the 9th Cavalry at Fort Davis, Fort Stockton, 
                    and Camp Hudson. The Congress reserved two regular army cavalry 
                    regiments and four of infantry to be manned by black enlisted 
                    personnel and white officers. The mounted units were the 9th 
                    and 10th Cavalry; the foot soldiers comprised the 38th, 39th, 
                    40th, and 41st Infantry. By the end of the 1860s, the four 
                    infantry regiments would be merged to form two&#151;the 24th 
                    and 25th Infantry. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Fort Lancaster was used briefly after the Civil 
                    War as a 9th Cavalry sub-post. On the day after Christmas, 
                    1867, a detachment of Company K was attacked there by a force 
                    estimated as numbering more than 900 Indians. The officer 
                    commanding the cavalry detachment reported that the attackers 
                    included a number of Spanish-speakers and English-speakers. 
                    One possible explanation is that the Indians were Comanches, 
                    the Spanish-speakers were New Mexican comancheros, and the 
                    English-speakers were former Confederate &quot;renegades,&quot; 
                    as the army officer characterized them.</p>
                  <p class="text">The comancheros were a later manifestation of 
                    the trade that had existed with the Comanches in the Pecos 
                    River valley of New Mexico since the mid-1700s. The Comanches 
                    had succeeded to the position of the Apaches as purveyors 
                    of buffalo robes to the Puebloan Indians and, later, Spanish 
                    New Mexicans. They would add stolen horses and&#151;in a throwback 
                    to the former Spanish slave trade&#151;captive Mexican and 
                    Anglo women and children to their inventory of trade goods. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to reoccupying the abandoned forts, the army in 
                    1867 established a new post near the junction of the main 
                    and north forks of the Concho River. Named Fort Concho, it 
                    was positioned to guard Goodnight-Loving cattle trail and 
                    the San Antonio-El Paso mail service on the &quot;upper&quot; 
                    road, as well as to interdict Indian raiders on their way 
                    from the Plains to the Texas Hill Country settlements and 
                    Mexican villages.</p>
                  <p class="text">After the Civil War, Texas cattle became a commodity 
                    the Comanches valued for the New Mexico market, and the Goodnight-Loving 
                    Trail provided many targets of opportunity. Pioneered by Texas 
                    frontiersmen Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving, the trail 
                    drives began in central north Texas west of Fort Worth, traveled 
                    southwest along the old Butterfield mail line to the Pecos 
                    River, then north along the river to Fort Sumner, in eastern 
                    New Mexico. Extensions of the trail continued north to Colorado 
                    and Wyoming. Comanches stole thousands&#151;perhaps tens of 
                    thousands&#151;of cattle from drovers along the trail in the 
                    late 1860s and early 1870s. The portion of the trail along 
                    the Texas stretch of the Pecos was hit especially hard.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Lieutenant Colonel William R. Shafter was ordered 
                    to clear the Indians from the region in 1875. Shafter's expedition 
                    lasted nearly four months, crossed the Llano Estacado three 
                    times, and covered some 2,500 miles. The campaign produced 
                    only three small skirmishes, but mapped territory that had 
                    previously been unknown to the army, and opened the area to 
                    the potential of white settlement. With that task completed, 
                    the army began to turn its attention to the western Trans-Pecos, 
                    where the last major Indian campaign in Texas would be fought.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1877, the Warm Springs Apache leader Victorio 
                    broke out of his San Carlos reservation in Arizona, and began 
                    raiding there and in Mexico. In addition to the Warm Springs 
                    band, Victorio counted many Chiracahua among his followers. 
                    They finally were induced to settle on the Mescalero reservation 
                    near Fort Stanton, New Mexico, where they fueled an already 
                    volatile situation. There followed a two-year pursuit of the 
                    Apaches involving the 9th Cavalry in New Mexico, the 10th 
                    Cavalry, 24th Infantry, 25th Infantry, and state rangers in 
                    Texas, and Mexican forces below the Rio Grande.</p>

                  <br><p class="text">The 10th Cavalry's Colonel Benjamin H. Grierson 
                    moved from Fort Concho to Fort Davis to be near the action, 
                    and directed a series of extensive scouts and tactical maneuvers 
                    that denied Victorio access to water sources in the Trans-Pecos. 
                    Only small skirmishes were fought north of the border, but 
                    the army's efforts helped Mexican soldiers corner Victorio 
                    in a mountain canyon in Chihuahua. There, on October 15, 1880, 
                    the Apache leader, 60 other warriors, and 18 Indian women 
                    and children were killed. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Victorio campaign was the last major operation 
                    conducted against Indians by U.S. Army forces in Texas, but 
                    the Trans-Pecos remained a focus of army activity until the 
                    1890s. Camp Pe&ntilde;a Colorado was established southwest 
                    of modern Marathon in 1879. Camp Rice was established on the 
                    Rio Grande north of Fort Quitman in 1881 and later was renamed 
                    Fort Hancock. With the army having completed its primary combat 
                    mission, its duties in the remainder of the 1880s included 
                    stringing telegraph wire and protecting railroad work parties 
                    making their way across the Trans-Pecos. </p>
                  <p class="text"> El Paso was connected to Fort Worth by way 
                    of the Texas and Pacific Railway, and to San Antonio (and 
                    Houston) by the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railway. 
                    Both lines joined the Southern Pacific track east of El Paso 
                    to link Texas to the Pacific coast by rail. The railroads 
                    bypassed Fort Davis and Fort Stockton, but the nearby civilian 
                    communities inherited the posts' names and became regional 
                    agriculture and trade centers, as well as county seats.</p>
                  <p class="text">The army abandoned Fort Quitman in 1882, Fort 
                    Stockton in 1886, and Fort Concho in 1889. Fort Davis lasted 
                    until 1891. Camp Pe&ntilde;a Colorado was abandoned in 1893, 
                    and Fort Hancock followed in 1895. </p>
                  <p class="text"> The prominent commanders moved on to other 
                    assignments, but several retained significant connections 
                    with the region. Benjamin Grierson continued ranching interests 
                    he had established near Fort Davis, and William &quot;Pecos 
                    Bill&quot; Shafter entered into a silver mining partnership 
                    near the town of Presidio with his former 24th Infantry subordinate, 
                    John Bullis. Between 1883 and 1952, 15 prospects were mined 
                    for silver and other ores in the Shafter Mining District. 
                    The Presidio Mine produced more than 32 million ounces of 
                    silver and 8,400 ounces of gold.<br>
