                  <p class="text">Anglo Texans greeted the end of the U.S-Mexican 
                    War in 1848 with the hope that federal troops would at last 
                    put an end to violent encounters with Indians and Mexicans 
                    along the state's western and southern borders and open the 
                    vast frontier to settlement. All too quickly the lure of nearly 
                    free and unbroken land attracted a multitude of pioneers. 
                    So rapidly, in fact, that it thrust some white settlers far 
                    beyond the protection of the eight new military installations 
                    established at war's end, running from Fort Worth in North 
                    Texas to Fort Duncan on the Rio Grande. </p>
                  <p class="text">In response, the U.S. Army in 1851 began establishing 
                    a new line of forts a hundred miles beyond the original vanguard. 
                    Others were located in the Big Bend country along the Rio 
                    Grande and in extreme South Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">For Hispanics and Indians, who also claimed 
                    much of this wild land as their home, the years of early statehood 
                    left them struggling merely to survive. The Treaty of Guadalupe 
                    Hidalgo that ended the late war cast many Tejanos into a perilous 
                    future, with their new citizenship shadowed by an alien legal 
                    system and powerful economic forces. Some would fight to hold 
                    what they had, and find their recourse outside the law. </p>
                  <p class="text">The situation for the Comanches was even more 
                    ominous. The effects of contact had visited the Penateka (southern) 
                    bands with lethal consequences. Dependence on the material 
                    goods of Anglos and a taste for alcohol broke both tradition 
                    and will. Epidemics of smallpox and other diseases passed 
                    along by California-bound Argonauts and other trespassers 
                    onto Comancher&iacute;a left these once-fearsome Penatekas 
                    staring hard at the prospect of extinction. Ecological changes, 
                    moreover, upset the annual migration of the great bison herds, 
                    a condition that would persist into the years of the Civil 
                    War. </p>
                  <p class="text">If that were not enough to spell the Penatekas' 
                    doom, traditional Indian enemies&#151;Lipan Apaches, Tonkawas, 
                    and others&#151;took advantage of this turn of fortune to 
                    settle old scores. Still others&#151;recent arrivals such 
                    as Kickapoos, Delawares, and Shawnees&#151;were swept onto 
                    the West Texas frontier by the advance of Americans far beyond 
                    the new state's borders. Armed with superior weaponry and 
                    well tutored in double-dealing, they further contracted the 
                    kingdom of these one-time Lords of the Plains. </p>
                  <p class="text">To Anglos, so many unrestrained Indian tribes 
                    and disgruntled Tejanos posed a psychological threat illuminated 
                    by the very real prospect of actual raids. Northern Comanches, 
                    joined by Kiowas and individuals from other tribes, splashed 
                    across the Red River from the Indian Territory and often probed 
                    the length of the frontier line, keeping settlers on constant 
                    alert. Additionally, the usual run of rootless and lawless 
                    whites took advantage of frontier conditions to prey upon 
                    the livestock of isolated settlers.</p>
                  <p class="text">On balance, the Texas frontier, like so much 
                    of America's westward expansion, held promise in one hand 
                    and peril in the other. Settlers bet their lives and property 
                    on the wager that chaos would quickly give way to order. In 
                    the estimation of these plucky newcomers, the prospective 
                    rewards were certainly worth the risks. Like their predecessors, 
                    the Spanish colonists who in the 1700s had settled the borderlands 
                    along the Rio Grande, they learned that all manner of hardships 
                    might be survived with a bit of luck and the support of neighbors, 
                    though often far afield.</p>
                  <p class="text">As the 1850s unfolded, signs of progress offered 
                    encouragement. However meager, any number of villages sprang 
                    up between the first and second line of U.S. posts from Gainesville 
                    near the Red River, to Uvalde and Brackett above the Rio Grande. 
                    The Peters Colony, established by the Republic-era legislature 
                    in part to attract Ohio Valley families as a buffer against 
                    the Penatekas, beckoned farmers who, on the grant's western 
                    edges, tilled virgin soil along the fertile creek banks and 
                    bottomlands of the Brazos and Trinity rivers. This expansive 
                    watershed came to be known as Northwest Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the Hill Country area, German and Alsatian 
                    emigrants continued to adapt their small-farming techniques 
                    to Texas' expansive spaces. Settlements such as Fredericksburg, 
                    New Braunfels and Castroville provided a bit of European culture 
                    on the frontier in spite of continued threats of Indian attacks.</p>
                  <p class="text">In 1858 the Southern Overland Mail, better known 
                    as the Butterfield stage, began cutting a path across the 
                    plains and prairies between its terminals at Saint Louis and 
                    San Francisco. From Sherman to El Paso a series of stations 
                    presented anchors around which communities seemed surely to 
                    emerge. </p>
                  <p class="text">Other newcomers to northern Texas learned that 
                    the Western Cross Timbers, a veritable &quot;cast iron forest,&quot; 
                    provided natural fencing. Indeed, many names later associated 
                    with the great post-Civil War cattle empire&#151;Hittson, 
                    Goodnight, Slaughter, and others&#151;seeded their first herds 
                    on the tall grass of these rocky, but fertile prairies closed 
                    in by the dense forests. </p>
                  <p class="text">Just when it seemed as if the frontier was beginning 
                    to join the mainstream of Texan society, Anglo-Indian conflicts 
                    and the Civil War reversed most of this material progress. 
                    Warrior bands&#151;mostly from the Indian Territory&#151;had 
                    never ceased to probe the defensive gaps along the line of 
                    the settlers' advance. For their part, the state and federal 
                    governments were often at odds, flip-flopping between policies 
                    of peace and war. </p>
                  <p class="text">Adding to the sense of anxiety, the federal 
                    government in 1854 leased four leagues of land for an Indian 
                    reservation along the Brazos River below Fort Belknap. A second 
                    reservation upstream was added for the Penatekas near Camp 
                    Cooper, on the Clear Fork of the Brazos. </p>
                  <p class="text">Many settlers expressed their admiration for 
                    the Indians' efforts to take up farming and stock raising, 
                    but others&#151;more outspoken in their criticism&#151;would 
                    not be satisfied until the native peoples were either exterminated 
                    or run out of Texas for good. While the rest of the state 
                    was preoccupied with rumors of slave insurrections, frontierspeople 
                    were stirred into the same kind of frenzy when a Jacksboro 
                    weekly, <em>The White Man</em>, embarked on a sensational campaign 
                    that preyed on settlers' fears and turned every rumor to fact. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">The pioneers' sense of dread was somewhat allayed 
                    in 1858 by news of two signal victories over their Plains 
                    adversaries. That spring, Texans led by ranger captain Rip 
                    Ford reported the defeat of over 300 determined warriors at 
                    the Battle of the Washita, in Indian Territory. Not far from 
                    there, near Wichita Village, U.S. Captain Earl Van Dorn routed 
                    about 500 Comanches and Kiowas that fall. </p>
                  <p class="text">Meanwhile, <em>The White Man</em> grew ever more 
                    vocal. Words grew into deeds, climaxing in the Reservation 
                    War of 1859 that pitted militiamen of Northwest Texas against 
                    the Indians on both reservations. While no pitched battles 
                    ensued, the affair resulted in the expulsion of the native 
                    peoples. </p>
                  <p class="text">At last it seemed as if Anglo Texans had gained 
                    control of the frontier. The Civil War intervened, however, 
                    proving that the worst of the settlers' troubles was only 
                    beginning. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Civil War cost pioneer folk both the protection of the 
                    federal troops and much of its home guard, as many militiamen 
                    took up arms and marched east to defend the South. Indians, 
                    revitalized by feelings of revenge, took advantage of the 
                    situation and attempted to reclaim their former homeland and 
                    hunting grounds. </p>

                    West experienced such trying conditions as those who remained 
                    on the Texas frontier during these years. While markets in 
                    the interior went begging for goods to send to the Confederate 
                    army, there was little the pioneers could produce in bulk. 
                    The scarcity of supplies and hard currency, moreover, left 
                    them to their own ingenuity. </p>
                  <p class="text">The one commodity they enjoyed in abundance 
                    was beef. From the brush country of South Texas to the grassy 
                    rolling plains of Northwest Texas, the lean, hardy breed of 
                    longhorn cattle proliferated. &quot;Cow hunters,&quot; as 
                    the early-day cowboys called themselves, at last found a use 
                    for this land that Brig. Gen. Belknap has declared unfit to 
                    inhabit. </p>
                  <p class="text">Most observers of the Civil War years claimed 
                    the Comanches and Kiowas rolled back the frontier a hundred 
                    miles in places; certainly the population thinned considerably. 
                    Even so, cow hunters actually extended their reach, adapting 
                    to the unfamiliar environment, even against the mortal peril 
                    of Indian raids. One outfit, near old Camp Cooper, was reportedly 
                    tending a herd of 25,000 head of longhorn when warriors forced 
                    them to flee. </p>
                  <p class="text">Most of the war parties were small in number, 
                    and the raids were short and sharp, but not all one-sided. 
                    An overburdened state cavalry and what was left of the local 
                    militias sporadically patrolled the frontier and kept their 
                    adversaries on guard. </p>
                  <p class="text">&quot;Forting up&quot; also offered a measure 
                    of security. At places with names such as Fort Spunky, Owl's 
                    Head, and Picketville, families and ranching outfits established 
                    citizen posts for mutual protection. </p>
                  <p class="text">The single most serious incident during these 
                    years came in the fall of 1864. The &quot;Elm Creek Raid&quot; 
                    in Young County reportedly involved a party of between five 
                    hundred and a thousand Comanches and Kiowas who raided the 
                    middle Brazos, virtually denuding the range of cattle and 
                    horses and besieging the citizen post Fort Murrah. If not 
                    for some of the home guard and a few isolated but well armed 
                    settlers who engaged the warriors, the death toll of the Texas 
                    pioneers would have been much worse. Along with the livestock, 
                    the war party returned to Indian Territory with almost a dozen 
                    women and children captives. </p>
                  <p class="text">The next year, 1865, brought an end to the Civil 
                    War, raising pioneers' expectations that the days of relative 
                    security would return. The federal government, however, placed 
                    Texas in a Reconstruction district with Louisiana and at first 
                    seemed little disposed to help their late foes with Indian 
                    problems they believed were of the Texans' own makings. Moreover, 
                    they forbid frontierspeople to raise arms and organize. The 
                    raids continued, bringing so many reports of depredations 
                    that their very scale created disbelief. </p>

                  <p class="text">By 1866, however, a line of federal forts approximating 
                    the antebellum configuration arose anew on the Texas frontier. 
                    Some, like Forts Richardson and Bliss, breathed life into 
                    towns such as Jacksboro and El Paso, respectively, while entirely 
                    new communities sprang up alongside other federal posts. Of 
                    these, a few survived their tumultuous frontier beginnings, 
                    such as Saint Angela (now San Angelo, alongside Fort Concho) 
                    and Fort Stockton in the shadow of the post that bore the 
                    same name. Others, such as The Flat below Fort Griffin, Scabtown 
                    near Fort McKavett, and Mobeetie beside Fort Elliott, enjoyed 
                    only a brief heyday, eventually losing their populations to 
                    other regional centers. </p>
                  <p class="text">As long as the soldiers patrolled the frontier, 
                    however, all the &quot;fort towns&quot; thrived by providing 
                    goods and services to the military. Most of those who settled 
                    near the posts were earnest pioneers who came west to take 
                    advantage of legitimate business opportunities. From the surrounding 
                    countryside they provided forage for army horses and mules 
                    and foodstuffs for the soldiers. In the towns themselves resided 
                    butchers and bakers, physicians and undertakers, preachers 
                    and schoolteachers, hide dressers and saddle makers, tailors 
                    and shoemakers, blacksmiths and wheelwrights, investors and 
                    carpenters, and hotelkeepers and livery operators. </p>
                  <p class="text">A smaller element composed of gamblers, whiskey 
                    peddlers, prostitutes, and desperadoes also came west to prey 
                    upon the adventurous and gullible. For the most part, townspeople 
                    successfully segregated them. Yet along the main street or 
                    district to which they were confined, the scene could be one 
                    of bedlam, especially when buffalo hunters and trail drivers 
                    hit town. </p>
                  <p class="text">Beginning in the middle of the 1870s a resource 
                    rush for bison hides turned The Flat, Saint Angela, and Rath 
                    City into veritable boomtowns. From the winter of 1874-75, 
                    when the great hunt began in earnest, until the time it petered 
                    out during the winter of 1878-79, the end of each season always 
                    ended in a &quot;spree&quot; that boosted the coffers of every 
                    frontier saloon from Fort Worth and Denison to San Antonio 
                    and El Paso. At the same time, north-and-west-bound trail 
                    drivers crossed much of the same land over the Western (or, 
                    Dodge City) Trail, and the Goodnight-Loving Trail. Often, 
                    these cowboys would signal their arrival by &quot;taking the 
                    town,&quot; a tradition that involved racing their horses 
                    down the main road between the false-fronted, picket, and 
                    adobe business houses, guns ablazing. </p>
                  <p class="text">Occasionally, the wide-open atmosphere resulted 
                    in bloodshed. These frontier villages contributed collectively 
                    to a legacy of violence that left and indelible imprint upon 
                    the state's, and even the world's, imagination.</p>
                  <p class="text">It was a reputation that was only partly deserved. 
                    Wildness was tolerated, indeed encouraged, because reckless 
                    behavior normally translated into reckless spending. Jacksboro 
                    man Thomas Horton, for example, recalled in his twilight years 
                    a scene from his childhood; it was shortly after payday at 
                    Fort Richardson: &quot;I am not exaggerating when I say I 
                    have seen the time when I could have walked on soldiers lying 
                    drunk along the road from the south side of the Square to 
                    the creek and not touch the ground.&quot; Like Horton's, the 
                    memories of others grew with the passing of time. A half-century 
                    after his brief stay at Fort Griffin's Flat, R. A. Slack declared: 
                    &quot;A killing was one of the ordinary, expected events of 
                    the night&#133;on which the comments were over, and the incident 
                    closed by the time the blood had been mopped up from the floor.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">On the contrary, the layers of law enforcement 
                    typically included town constables, county sheriffs and their 
                    deputies, and officers of the court at every level from the 
                    justice of the peace to county and district judges. Texas 
                    Rangers and the federal troops themselves also involved themselves 
                    in civil affairs on many occasions. Most of the time the law 
                    was diligent and performed admirably, despite the trying frontier 
                    conditions. </p>
                  <p class="text">If justice lacked, it was normally in cases 
                    involving minorities. On several occasions at various frontier 
                    towns, both soldiers and private citizens literally got away 
                    with murdering Indians who happened to cross their path at 
                    the wrong time. In other cases, buffalo soldiers and other 
                    African-Americans as well as Tejanos who became victims of 
                    violent crimes could never count on the impartiality of white 
                    juries.</p>
                  <p class="text">The other exception regarded vigilante movements. 
                    Horse and cattle thieves always ran the risk of being hanged 
                    on the spot if caught on the open range. In the Mason County 
                    War (or, Hoodoo War as it has also been called) and in the 
                    Fort Griffin country, organized mobs were responsible for 
                    upwards of two-dozen hangings and shootings. Even though Texas 
                    Rangers intervened in both movements, not a single vigilante 
                    ever suffered a murder conviction. Partly as a result, stockmen 
                    in the Cross Timbers organized the Northwest Texas Cattle 
                    Raisers Association.</p>

                  <p class="text">On the range itself, cattlemen established massive 
                    ranches such as the Espuela (Spur) Cattle Company&#151;a half-million-acre 
                    spread that covered parts of four West Texas counties. Until 
                    the mid-1870s the typical rancher grazed his cattle on state 
                    land and purchased only land that would guarantee a monopoly 
                    on water rights. A number of developments, however, quickly 
                    changed the nature of the business. Barbed wire, a nationwide 
                    depression following the Panic of 1873, competition from eastern 
                    and British capitalists, and a series of droughts and blizzards 
                    in the 1880s brought a measure of scientific management to 
                    the industry even before the frontier had passed. </p>
                  <p class="text">With the Plains Indians confined to reservations 
                    in Indian Territory following the Red River War (1874-75), 
                    settlers soon crowded the frontier. A line of towns emerged 
                    at the edge of the treeline during the last half of the decade, 
                    some that would survive, others that were destined to become 
                    ghost towns. North-to-south beyond the Cross Timbers, they 
                    included Eagle Flats (Vernon), Oregon City (Seymour), Wiliamsburg, 
                    Throckmorton, Albany, Callahan City, Belle Plain, and Coleman. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">By the end of the 1870s, the national economic 
                    depression had mostly run its course, and the long-awaited 
                    southern transcontinental route soon became a reality. The 
                    Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad that had stood frozen between 
                    Dallas and Fort Worth since 1873, suddenly burst across West 
                    Texas in 1880 and 1881. By the time it connected with the 
                    Southern Pacific near Sierra Blanca, any number of tent and 
                    clapboard railroad towns sprang up along the tracks. Abilene, 
                    planned by the T&amp;P as its market hub, signaled the beginning 
                    of a new era. </p>
                  <p class="text">Certainly, frontier conditions still existed 
                    in the 1880s, and pioneers had much new ground to break in 
                    the 1890s. Yet by the time the Texas frontier had run its 
                    course, those who settled the land could point to a unique
