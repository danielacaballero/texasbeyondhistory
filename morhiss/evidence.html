	<p>Unraveling the evidence from Morhiss  Mound remains a challenge. From today&rsquo;s  perspective we realize that the site&rsquo;s formation processes, cultural history,  and material remains would have been very challenging to understand. The archeologists of the 1930s had a limited understanding of the age and nature  of the prehistoric archeological record they encountered and followed excavation  and analysis methods we consider rudimentary today.  To be fair, the same could be said (and often is) about most earlier archeological  investigations when viewed with the hindsight of succeeding decades. So rather  than lament evidence we do not have, let&rsquo;s look at the wealth of in-hand evidence from  Morhiss Mound, mindful that most of the material and documentation from the site has  yet to be fully analyzed and reported.</p>

    <h3>S<a name="stratigraphy"></a>tratigraphy - How the Site Formed</h3>

<p>The mounded appearance of the  knoll formed long before humans set foot on the site. The deepest layers the archeologists  encountered were lenses of sand, clay, and gravels that we now recognize were  deposited by the ancient Guadalupe   River sometime in the  Late Pleistocene (the  last Ice Age), roughly 15-30 thousand  years ago or more. Most of these deposits  were part of what geologists call the Deweyville Terrace formation, a broad  depositional pattern recognized along the major drainages across much of the  western Gulf plains. Within the ancient terrace deposits at Morhiss were  scattered fossil animal bones. These are known to paleontologists as Rancholabrean (Pleistocene) fauna  including such Ice-Age animals as horse,  mammoth, camel, and sloth. All of these creatures  became extinct by 10,000 years ago. The WPA work showed that these bones were in  secondary context, meaning that they were washed down the river from where the  animals died and from where the bones had originally fossilized. In the Late  Pleistocene, the fossil bones had become incorporated within the layers of  sand, clay, and gravels that formed the ancient terrace deposits.</p>

	<p>Through time, the ancient  Deweyville Terrace was eroded and shaped by the meandering Guadalupe River  and its tributaries. By roughly  12,000  years ago, if not before, a distinct knoll had formed, a &ldquo;terrace remnant&rdquo; in  geological terms. Periodic floods  continued to shape and erode the knoll and sometimes add newer sediment layers. The ancient knoll was capped by a relatively  thin layer not much more than a foot thick of sand and gravel within which were  bones and some artifacts, many of them heavily patinated (chemically weathered)  and covered with calcium carbonate encrustation. The archeologists termed this the <strong>transition  zone</strong> because it contained both fossil bones and the bones of still-living  animals as well as a few man-made artifacts.  The artifacts included a few Late Paleoindian points, most of the  Angostura type, but several others as well, including a fragment of a Midland point that dates to some 12,000 years ago (10,000 B.C.).</p>  

    <p>By the dawn of the Early Archaic some  9,000 years ago, the eroded terrace knoll became a favored campsite,  establishing a cultural pattern that continued for over 8,000 years. A dark, organic-rich layer formed, which the  archeologists called a <strong>midden</strong> deposit. This thick deposit of sandy loam ranged  from a few inches thick at the outer edges of the knoll to about 12 feet thick  in the center of the mound. Similar midden layers are found at many Archaic and  Late Prehistoric terrace sites where people often camped along the Guadalupe River.  Such midden deposits are accumulations of both cultural materials&mdash;camp  debris such as ashes, charcoal, discarded plant remains, animal bones, hides,  etc.&mdash;and natural organic materials&mdash;rotting leaves and such. It is likely that the Morhiss midden also  incorporated fine sediments deposited as thin layers during particularly high  floods. If so, no obvious evidence of  flood deposits was recognized and it is to be expected that such thin lenses  would have soon become mixed within the midden as people returned to the site,  trampled around, dug holes, built fires, and so on.</p>
    <p>The knoll was within the dense  wooded bottomlands along the river and it was doubtlessly covered by trees and  undergrowth except for areas that people must have cleared off for camping and  other activities. Most likely they  cleared around larger trees and left these standing for shade and perhaps to  help support temporary shelters such as lean-tos. The river&rsquo;s position relative to the knoll  likely changed during the last 10,000 years (the Holocene or recent geological period), probably several times as the Guadalupe migrated (meandered) through  its sediment-filled valley. One such  meander scar (relict channel) is obvious in aerial photos and topographic maps and passed  within a few hundred feet of the knoll.  The timing and dating of the river meanders in this section of the  Guadalupe are not precisely known.</p>
    <p>The great majority of all  artifacts, features, and human burials were found within the dark thick midden  at the Morhiss Mound. The WPA archeologists  saw the midden layer as a single deposit because they did not recognize any  internal layering. But most of the  digging was done quickly by untrained laborers using picks and shovels. It is likely that some surviving traces of  internal depositional layers, from minor floods as well as human activities, could  have been recognized in places within the mound using modern excavation techniques  and geoarcheological investigation. But most of depostional layering would have been mixed and obscured by both natural processes, such as tree  roots, insects, and burrowing animals, as well as cultural processes such as  digging pits for burials and other purposes.  By far  the most commonly noted disturbances were rodent burrows, most of which were  created by pocket gophers and most of which were probably relatively recent in  age. </p>
    <p>Duffen  recognized that there were some recognizable changes in artifact styles and  burial practices over the considerable time during which the site formed. In  fact, he sketched a basic chronological outline with four periods and seven  phases that is among the first such developmental charts that anyone devised  for an archeological site in Texas. This provisional scheme was based on his observations  and documentation of where certain types of artifacts and certain types of  tool-making technology occurred within the site. This ahead-of-its-time thinking underscores  the loss to archeological progress that occurred because he wasn&rsquo;t able to  complete the analysis and reporting of the Morhiss site. It would take decades before archeologists  would put forth an improved scheme for the lowerGuadalupe   Valley. Duffen&rsquo;s prescient insight seems to have gone  unnoticed by later archeologists, unpublished and forgotten. </p></td>

<p>The  WPA archeologists documented 42 cultural features, not counting the  burials. This too was an improvement  over earlier excavations during the Pearce-led era when similar features were sometimes  mentioned in passing, but very rarely documented. The Morhiss features included about 25  recognizable hearths as well as caches of artifacts and sea shells, two small  piles of oyster shells, and two large masses of asphaltum. One suspects that  these were only the most obvious features and that there were very likely many  other more subtle patterns such as charcoal stained patches, small burned rock  clusters, and concentrations of artifacts and animal bones, that would be recorded  and sampled as features today. Nonetheless, the formal documentation of 42  features represents an important step forward for archeological  investigation. Each feature was assigned  a feature number, described in the field on a printed feature form, sometimes  sketched, and further documented by a photograph of the fully exposed pattern. </p>

  This cluster of river-rounded rocks (Feature 30) may represent baking stones arranged as  a hot-rock bed and capped by an earth oven.

	<div class="caption">
  This cluster of baked clay balls is an obvious example of the use of baked clay as a substitute for cooking stones. When heated,  grapefruit-sized &quot;balls&quot; of wet clay  were transformed into  crude  ceramic objects that could hold and slowly release  heat for baking, just like heated pieces of sandstone and limestone. Similar artifacts have been found at many sites along the Gulf coastal plains where stone is hard to find. The same function is attributed to &quot;Poverty Point Objects&quot; (shaped pieces of baked clay) found at the famous Poverty Point site (ca. 1500-800 B.C.) in Louisiana.

	<p>The  25 hearths included intact relatively small, roughly circular or oval patterns  of closely spaced sandstone cobbles and rounded balls of baked clay as well as a  few scattered patterns and one small group of closely spaced sandstone  slabs. From today&rsquo;s perspective, most of  the &ldquo;hearths&rdquo; probably represent the heating elements or &ldquo;oven beds&rdquo; of small  earth ovens, a pattern now known to be characteristic of Archaic sites in much  of Western (and probably Eastern) North America.  Of particular interest is the use of baked clay balls. In the 1930s, and for decades thereafter,  archeologists debated how baked clay balls formed and whether they were used as  substitutes for baking stones (&ldquo;burned rocks&rdquo;).  The photographic evidence from Morhiss provides very clear examples of  this pattern. As can be seen most  clearly in the photographs of Feature 38, the clay balls were unnaturally  rounded, grapefruit-sized, round to oval masses and these were packed together  just like the stone &ldquo;hearths&rdquo; &ndash; earth oven beds. The fact that some hearths at Morhiss  contained both rocks and baked clay balls reinforces the functional  equivalence. </p>
<p>Among  the features were at least 10 caches of various materials including stone  tools, unworked flint cobbles, and marine shells. These tight clusters of artifacts apparently  were not directly associated with burials, although it is not known whether  they were cached for later use or as offerings.  Similar caches have been found in the region in cemetery sites such as  Loma Sandia as well as in isolated circumstances (see <a href="../st-plains/prehistory/images/caches.html" target="_blank">Biface Caches</a>). The caches of asphaltum suggest storage for  later use as a hafting adhesive; over 70 dart points and stone adzes were said  to have traces of asphaltum in the areas of the tools where they would have  been affixed to wooden handles or shifts.  In one case a mass of asphaltum was buried with two flint knives,  several bone awls, and antler flaking tools; this would seem to be a  tool-making cache. </p>
	<h3>S<a name="tools"></a>tone Tools and Pottery</h3>

<p>Some 7000 artifacts were  recovered from Morhiss during the WPA excavations and most of these were stone  tools. As Campbell noted, this is a comparatively small  number given that 5,000 squares were excavated, less than 2 artifacts per  square dug and even the most prolific squares had no more than 8-10  artifacts. On the face of it, the site  would seem to have had a very low artifact density, but several factors must be  considered. First, during the WPA work,  only relatively complete and &ldquo;recognizable&rdquo; artifacts were counted and  collected as artifacts. Further, these were collected by hand as they were  spotted by the workers; the excavated soil was not screened as is almost always  done today. Therefore, most small tool  fragments and all pieces of chipping debris were routinely discarded, as were  most animal bones, charred remains, snails, and other kinds of evidence that  are routinely collected and accounted for today. Second, the 5,000 squares were dug to varying  depths and some were situated on the thin outer edge of the mound and beyond. These factors make it all but impossible to  meaningfully compare the artifact density within the Morhiss site to that  documented by modern excavations at other sites. </p>
<p>The WPA did have a  well-organized laboratory in San Antonio where  most of the artifacts from Morhiss and other Texas excavation projects were taken from  the field and processed. While the WPA  field crews consisted only of men, the WPA lab workers included women as well. All  of the artifacts and human remains from the Morhiss excavation were carefully cleaned,  labeled, inventoried and later sorted into categories. Unfortunately, many of the categories and  descriptive terms used by the WPA are not of much use today. </p>
<p>In 1940, little was understood  about lithic technology and most of the variability of stone tool forms and  styles was not recognized by most. Stone  tools were seen as primitive artifacts created by primitive peoples. General  similarities among Archaic dart points, for instance, caused early  archeologists to lump most together and ignore the considerable stylistic  variation. In some areas of North  America, particularly those where &ldquo;higher cultures&rdquo; had existed that lived in  permanent settlements and made pottery, such as Mesoamerica and the American  Southwest, archeologists were making progress in sorting out and understanding  artifact variation. Less had been  accomplished in Texas  and a workable classification scheme would not exist until the mid-1950s. </p>

	<p>Among the recognized and  collected artifacts from the Morhiss Mound site are many projectile points,  bifacial knives and preforms, and stone adzes, as well as scrapers, drills, hammerstones,  and various other tool forms. As said,  these have yet to be systematically studied and accounted for using a modern  classification system. Yet, the Morhiss  collection was well known and often consulted by Texas archeologists of the 1950s when  classification systems were being worked out. </p>
<p>Among those who examined the  collections and sorted at least the projectile points into provisional or  established groupings were <strong>J. Charles Kelley</strong> and <strong>Alex D. Krieger</strong>, both of whom  were well-educated archeologists who had come to the University of Texas  in the 1940s in the waning years of the WPA.  Kelley led some of the later WPA excavations, particular those along  the Colorado River west of Austin. Krieger came a bit later, after the WPA field  projects had ended. He was assigned to  follow up on some of the most important WPA projects, most notably that of the  George C. Davis site in east Texas.  Krieger continued to work for the University on federally sponsored projects  after the WPA era ended. Unfortunately, Kelley  and Krieger apparently viewed each other as competitors and did not get along. </p>
<p>The history of this era of Texas archeology  deserves to be properly told, but that would require a book-length  treatment. Of interest here is the fact  that both Kelley and Krieger devised their own classification schemes and both  made reference to the Morhiss collection.  Although it is obvious that both were quite familiar with the  collection, neither published anything on the Morhiss site materials except  indirectly, and whatever analytical notes each may have kept on the Morhiss  collection do not appear to have survived.  Kelley&rsquo;s classification scheme was never fully published and his  approach did not take hold. In contrast,  the 1954 publication of <em>An Introductory  Handbook of Texas Archeology</em> by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks established many  of the named artifact types that are still used today. </p>
<p>Archeologist <strong>Richard  Weinstein</strong> has pointed out that many projectile points from the Morhiss collection  were illustrated as representative examples of the newly defined projectile types  that Krieger and his colleagues set forth in the <em>Handbook</em>. In the 1954  volume, photographs of Morhiss artifacts appear as examples of no fewer  than 13  named dart point types ranging in age from the Late Paleoindian Plainview and  Meserve types to the Transitional Archaic Ensor and Fairland types. One of the newly named types was named the  <strong>Morhiss dart point</strong>, a style that was then known from few other sites. Today the Morhiss point is known to date to  the Late Archaic period and  is mainly found at sites within the lower Guadalupe River drainage basin in  the eastern  South Texas Plains. </p>
<p>Artifact typology, of course, is an ongoing process.  Types are not &ldquo;once and forever&rdquo; categorizations, but simply best-guess  descriptive groupings based on available data and  that are subject to revision and reappraisal. The artifact type descriptions, Part II of  the 1954 <em>Handbook</em>, were revised by Suhm and Jelks and published by the TAS in  1962. In the intervening decades many new  artifact styles have been described and some of the existing ones have been  revised. Typology is not an end into  itself, but simply an analytical tool that is used to help address research  questions and allow effective communication. </p>
<p>Campbell&rsquo;s 1962 appraisal of the Morhiss site summarizes the  major artifact forms and types present in the collection and adds some  observations. For instance, among the lanceolate  dart points, he recognized 10 or 12 points similar to the Angostura style, and  noted that &ldquo;a few points look Plainview  in outline, but lack grinding and show rather crude flaking.&rdquo; The Angostura type is now considered by most to date to the onset of the Early  Archaic period and tightly  dated at several sites at about 7,000 to 6,800 B.C., although the style is thought  to first appear as early about 7,900 at the Wilson-Leonard. It is doubtful  as to whether Paleoindian  experts today would regard any of the lanceolate points from Mohiss as examples  of the Plainview  type. This uncertainty also makes plain  the need for a thorough reappraisal and publication of the Morhiss  collection.</p>
<p>There are several Paleoindian points that suggest the first visitors were considerably earlier than Angostura times. There is at least one classic Golondrina point, which has been dated elsewhere in Texas to about 8,000 B.C. And there is a distal section of a very thin, very well made parallel-sided lanceolate point that  closely resembles the Midland type. This type co-occurs with Folsom points around 10,000 B.C. The  incomplete specimen from Morhiss hints that  humans first set foot on the site during  Early Paleoindian times some 12,000 years ago.   </p>

	<p>Here we provide some recent  and WPA period photographs of a small selection of the Morhiss artifacts and  offer a few comments within the captions and below on some of the most common  types and most telling patterns.</p>
<p>The bulk of the projectile  points are dart points dating to the Middle and Late Archaic periods according  to the current chronological scheme devised for the eastern Edwards Plateau  (see <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/plateaus/prehistory/images/ep.html" target="_blank">Eastern Plateau Prehistory</a>). As archeologists have long recognized, many  of the stone tools from the Morhiss site closely resemble those that are  characterstic of the eastern Edwards Plateau and adjacent areas of central Texas. This is not surprising because the Guadalupe River  originates there and it is clear that in prehistoric times the Guadalupe Valley  was a transportation route between central Texas and the coast. Among the dart point  styles found at Morhiss that are usually identified with central Texas are the Uvalde,  Nolan, Travis, Bulverde, Pedernales, Marcos, Lange, Ensor, Fairland, and Darl  types. There are also numerous specimens of unstemmed styles that are commonly  associated with the South Texas Plains including the Tortugas, Abasolo, Refugio,  Lerma, Kinney, and Matamoros  types. There are other points,  especially those of the Morhiss type, that mainly occur within the lower Guadalupe  drainage system. </p>
<p> Archeologist <strong>Daniel Fox</strong> studied dart points from the proposed, but never built, Cuero I Reservoir area along the Guadalupe River some 30-30 miles upstream from Morhiss Mound.  He realized that many Archaic dart point styles common in the lower Guadalupe Valley  were made using a cobble reduction technique.  In contrast, further up the Guadalupe on the Edwards Plateau the same styles were  made using a flake reduction technique. In cobble reduction,   the knapper makes the dart point directly from a whole cobble, whereas in flake reduction the point is made from a  large flake.This technological difference reflects  the available raw material. The chert (flint) cobbles available along the Lower Guadalupe are generally relatively small in contrast to the large tabular cobbles and nodules  of high quality chert found in many areas of the Edwards Plateau. It is very likely that the core reduction method was the predominate technique used at Morhiss Mound as well. 
<p>There were also many other  types of chipped stone tools in the Morhiss collection including knives, bifacial chopping tools, scrapers,  drills and adzes. Among the knives, Campbell noted &ldquo;quite a  number of long, narrow, triangular knives that are very beautifully  chipped.&rdquo; There were also at least three  corner-tanged knives, a specialized artifact type that is often found in  cemeteries and in caches that date to the Late Archaic. Most of the corner-tangs found in the South  Texas Plains are characteristically  made of Edwards chert and are thought to  represent trade items originating in central Texas. </p>
<p>The  stone adze types present include Clear Fork and Guadalupe tools (also called  gouges), of which many examples and several varieties were found. Most of these probably represent wood-working  tools and have parallel forms that are made from shell. The preponderance of wood-working tools is  discussed in the Morhiss Revisited section. </p>
<p>Ground  stone tools found at Morhiss include ordinary food processing and tool-making tools  such as manos, metates, abrading stones, and a stone pestles, as well as more  unusual items including pendants (or gorgets), bola stones, a stone plummet, and a bannerstone fragment. Most of the  uncommon items were associated  with burials and are similar to specimens found in the Early Archaic cemetery  at Buckeye Knoll, a recently excavated site about 5 miles downstream from  Morhiss Mound. The bannerstone, pendants, and the stone plummet suggest that  Morhiss inhabitants participated in a social network with far-reaching  extra-regional contacts to the northeast and east within the Eastern Woodlands.</p>
<p>Although  the bulk of the time-sensitive artifacts found at the Morhiss site date to the  Archaic, artifacts dating to the Late Prehistoric were found in the uppermost  deposits. These include Scallorn and  Perdiz arrow points and several dozen prehistoric pottery sherds. There are also hints that the Morhiss site  was occupied, even if briefly, during the Spanish Colonial era, probably the 18th  century when Spanish missions and presidios existed in the Victoria area. These early historic artifacts include  Mexican glazed earthenwares and unglazed ceramic sherds are reminiscent of  molcajetes or grater bowls. </p>

	<h3>S<a name="shell"></a>hell Artifacts</h3>
<p>The  marine and freshwater shell artifacts from Morhiss are better known as these  have been the  focus of detailed analysis (see <a href="images/Dockall-1996.pdf" target="_blank">Dockall and Dockall 1996<img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>). A total of 3,323 marine shell  artifacts were recovered from the site, dramatically more than the artifacts  made of freshwater shells. Of the total  number of shell artifacts recovered, 3125 are classified as shell beads or  pendants. By far the most abundant were over  3000 beads manufactured from the Common Atlantic Marginella, a species widely used by prehistoric peoples. Nineteen beads were made from the Virgin Nerite, a small marine gastropod that was apparently rarely used elsewhere (see <a href="images/Dockall-1994.pdf" target="_blank">Dockall and Dockall 1994<img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>)  Most of these small, simple beads of both species were once  part of necklaces or decorated clothing items  that were included as grave  offerings. </p> 
  
<p>The  shell pendants (or gorgets) are larger, more diverse, and were more difficult  to make. Most were fashioned from Lightning Whelk (conch, <em>Busycon perversum</em>) shell or from marine and freshwater bivalve (clam)  shells. Although whelk shell pendants  take several forms, most of those found at Morhiss closely resemble artifacts  known from Late Archaic cemetery sites in the Western Gulf Coastal Plain. Many of the shell pendants from Morhiss  exhibit design elements dominated by scored lines and drilled punctuations  (dots). One unusual pendant recovered from Morhiss is a shell disk having a  central perforation and three sets of incised horizontal lines. An almost identical specimen was recovered  from the <a href="../st-plains/images/ap10.html" target="_blank">Olmos Dam cemetery</a> in Bexar County. </p>
<p>These  design elements are similar to other Archaic sites along the West Gulf Coastal  Plain and could indicate group participation within a broader belief or social  system. In addition to formal shell  ornaments associated with burials there were also several small caches of  marine shells that were documented as features.  Similar shell caches occurred at the <a href="../st-plains/images/ap8.html"> Loma Sandia cemetery</a>. </p>
<p>Shell  artifacts were associated with approximately 10% of all burials at Morhiss, and  had  age and  gender associations similar to those of  other Late Archaic cemeteries such as Ernest Witte,  Crestmont, Blue Bayou, Olmos Dam, and Loma Sandia. Among  these sites, shell grave goods were interred more often with adults than  children and typically occurred with both adult males and females. Although no female burials were identified at  Morhiss that were associated with shell artifacts, this is most likely due to  the fact that most skeletons were not preserved well enough to identify gender.  Morhiss had a greater number of burials  for which sex could not be determined than other Late Archaic cemeteries. </p>
<p>The  Morhiss collection also includes about 200 shell tools, some which were  associated with burials and others found scattered within the midden. These include a variety of forms that are  functionally similar to some of the stone tools. Tool types consist of two forms of whelk  shell hammers, three types of whelk shell adzes, and assorted cutting and  scraping tools manufactured from marine and freshwater bivalves. Bivalve cutting tool forms are represented by  notched and unifacially retouched tools.  Whelk shell hammers of both types exhibit characteristic battering and  polish from use. </p>

	<p>Wear  and fracture patterns of beveled shell adzes indicate that these implements  were typically hafted and were probably used as wood-working tools in a manner  similar to Guadalupe and Clear Fork tools.  Microscopic &ldquo;wear pattern&rdquo; study showed that the beveled shell tools had  fracture patterns, battered edges, striations, polish, and impact damage  similar to wear types documented for beveled stone tools. Similar shell implements  have been documented at many Archaic coastal sites such as those along Oso  Creek, which empties into the Nueces Bay system near Corpus    Christi. </p>
<p>The  presence of diverse types of shell artifacts at an inland site like Morhiss  suggests that the groups who frequented the site were quite familiar with the coast  and doubtlessly spent part of their yearly round there. Most of the shell  artifacts were probably made at the coast and brought to the site in finished  form or perhaps as preforms requiring only grinding or decoration. This makes sense because it did not require  hauling quantities of marine shell up the Guadalupe River  at least 20 miles inland, and twice that distance to the Gulf strandline where  most of the shells were most easily found.  The early stages of manufacture of both stone and shell tools would have  resulted in a relatively high failure rates, and there are only a few  candidates for failed shell tools at Morhiss.</p>

<p>That  said, there is some shell debris at the Morhiss site that appears to be the byproduct  of the manufacture of shell tools or ornaments, especially from whelk  shell. This debris gives us some insight  into shell artifact manufacturing techniques. The evidence suggests the use of  direct percussion and cutting to break up and segment suitable shell pieces for  tools and ornaments. Cutting was accomplished by tabular sandstone abraders or  similar tools. In some instances, the groove and snap technique was used to  segment shell pieces. </p>	
<p>The presence of adze blanks and shell debitage at Morhiss suggests that whole conch shells and perhaps suitable fragments were part of shell "tool kits" that groups carried inland from the coast. A whole large conch shell was also recovered from the Morhiss site.</p>
<h3>B<a name="bone"></a>one Artifacts</h3>
<p>The Morhiss collection has a rather large and diverse assemblage  of bone tools and ornaments, 271 artifacts in total, and these have been  partially analyzed. Like the shell assemblage, the bone ornaments were  found mainly in association with burials, while the bone tools were found in both  burial and non-burial contexts. Common  implements are bone and antler flaking tools, ulna tools, and a variety of awls  manufactured from bone splinters, deer metapodials (upper foot bones), and  split metapodials. Ornaments include a  variety of beads, a possible earspool  made from a shark vertebra, and incised pins. </p>
<p>Six socketed deer phalanges (lower foot bones) and  antler tips with traces of asphaltum were recovered from the Morhiss site are  puzzling as to their function. These have ground, pointed tips. Similar artifacts  were recovered from other sites along the upper Texas coast, including the Harris County  Boy&rsquo;s School site and the Crestmont site. Those from the former have been interpreted  as projectile points, but they are longer and more sharply pointed than the  Morhiss specimens. Some have speculated that socketed deer bone and antler artifacts  may have functioned as atlatl spurs, bone tinklers or rattle segments. </p>
<p>Sets  of certain bone and antler artifacts and other items found in association with  burials are thought to be toolkits used to making lithic or shell artifacts.  For instance, an adult male (Burial 139) was interred with three clam shells, a  bone flaking tool or awl, four flint flaking tools,  and a number of shell  beads. Another adult male (Burial 39)  was associated with two pigment stones, a bone awl, an antler flaker and a bone  ornament.<strong> </strong>Burial 50, also male, included worked and drilled shell  pieces, 50 columella beads, and an antler flaking tool. An adult of unknown sex was also interred  with five stone adzes. </p>
<p>Perhaps  the most fascinating toolkit was that interred with an adult male (Burial 119),  which included an array of 5 fragmentary antler billets, an antler tine pressure  flaker and punch, a chert scraper, a sandstone abrader, incised and plain long  bone implements, and a mass of asphaltum weighing between 800-1000 grams (over  2 pounds). These burial goods were all  coated with red ocher that appeared to have been applied in a liquid form, perhaps  a mineral paint. Duffen&rsquo;s field notes remarked  that a stone knife and bone needle was also recovered with this burial and that  the asphaltum seemed to have been contained within a &ldquo;skin pouch,&rdquo; presumably  because of the shape of the mass. A final  grave inclusion with Burial 119 was said  to be a &ldquo;mass of Mexican persimmons,&rdquo; but is unclear whether the mass occurred  as seeds or charred/dried fruits. The  fruits of Mexican persimmon (<em>Diospyros  texana</em>) ripen in late summer, suggesting that indicating that Burial 119  was interred during this part of the year.

	<h3>H<a name="human"></a>uman Remains</h3>
	<p>Duffen  estimated that 219 human burials had been documented, representing at least 250  individuals. Campbell estimated that the site may have  contained as many as 300 burials. The  exact number will never be known, in part  because some had been removed by early artifact collectors such as J. L.  Jarrett who had visited and doubtlessly dug into Morhiss Mound before the 1932  work. Field notes from the 1932 and  later WPA work note hearsay accounts of uncontrolled digging and the WPA work  documented visible disturbances in the mound thought to represent pits dug by  artifact collectors. </p>  

<p>Most  of the documented burials were single interments, but there were a few multiple  interments as well as well as situations where one interment intruded into  another, adding uncertainty to the sequence of events. According to Campbell&rsquo;s assessment, most of the documented  burials (61%) were primary interments, meaning that the bodies were still intact  when interred. Of these, most (55% of  the documented burials) were interred in flexed positions, meaning that the  knees were bent, while only 6% of the burials were placed in extend positions. Most or all of the extended burials were well  preserved and found in the upper part of the mound, suggesting that this burial  pattern occurred late in time. The prevalence of flexed and bundle burials in relatively early times at Morhiss is consistent with the findings at the nearby Early Archaic cemetery at Buckeye Knoll. </p>
<p>Tellingly,  some 30% of the documented burials at Morhiss were &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; or secondary interments, while  the remaining 9% were represented only by crania (skulls) due to previous disturbance,  poor preservation, and other factors.  The bundle burials are so named because the bones were no longer  anatomically articulated, meaning that the bodies must have decayed before the  burial event; most likely because the individuals died elsewhere and were later  brought to the Morhiss Mound for interment.  Relative to other cemeteries known in the coastal plains, this is a much  higher ratio, and suggests that Morhiss was a place where people intentionally  returned to bury their dead.</p>
<p>The  burial associations (grave offerings) are difficult to assess. Isolated or scattered stone artifacts such as  projectile points, knives, and adzes were found near many burials, but many of  these may have been part of the midden accumulation rather than intentional grave  offerings. About 20 individuals had  ornaments of shell, bone, or stone that were clearly left as offerings. Some of  the projectile points found amid or near burials may have been the cause of  death. </p>
<p>During the WPA era, physical  anthropologist <strong>Marcus S. Goldstein</strong> studed the skeletal remains from Morhiss Mound and other WPA sites in Texas. He carefully catalogued each individual skeleton and made systematic measurements and observations. Although he later published  several articles on his Texas studies, most of his pioneering work for the WPA, including that on  Morhiss, was never published. In the late 1950s, <strong>Thomas W. McKern, </strong>who taught physical anthropology at the University of Texas, conducted a second  analysis of Morhiss skeletal  material. This study, too, whent unpublished. According to Campbell's later summary, McKern identified a total of 63 measurable  individuals. Of these, 27 were  identified as male and 36 were female. He  estimated the average age at death of the adult males was approximately 44  years, while that of the adult females was 37.5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Helen  D. Dockall</strong> (1997) conducted a more comprehensive bioarchaeological analysis of the  skeletal remains of 204 individuals from the Morhiss site. The age composition  of the sample is composed predominantly of adults (84.8 percent) and the  remaining 15.2 percent being subadult. This pattern is in part related to  skeletal preservation factors at the site&mdash;the bones of adults are more likely  to be preserved than those of children, especially young children. The male to female sex ratio for Morhiss is  roughly 1:1. Approximately 83% of the Morhiss  population represented by the study died prior to entering old adulthood  (determined at 50 plus years). A similar pattern was also documented for Late  Archaic burial population at the Ernest Witte site. </p>
<p>The  skeletal evidence for any infectious diseases was low among the skeletal remains  from both sites, which suggests that the Late Archaic populations along the  West Gulf Coastal Plain had relatively good health. Evidence of skeletal  disorders, demography and body-size differences also indicates that Archaic  populations on the inland portion of the coastal plain were well-adapted to  their environment. Infectious diseases were documented in the Morhiss  population, as evidenced by cranial infections, periostitis/osteitis and  treponematosis, but rates of infection were low. </p>
<p>At  the Morhiss site, rates of degenerative joint disease, iron deficiency anemia,  and other metabolic disorders were low compared to more inland hunting and  gathering groups. Dental health and dental disorders documented for the Morhiss  sample indicate a diet relatively low in carbohydrates. This is based on low  rates of caries, relatively moderate tooth wear rates, and low abscess rates. Although  the overall dental health of the Morhiss population is decidedly better than  that of inland populations, when compared to Ernest Witte population, that of  Morhiss peoples suggest a diet of more foods higher in sugar-rich carbohydrates  such as prickly pear.</p>
<p>Skeletal  traumas (broken and impacted bones) were commonly observed on bones of the  hands and feet and, more rarely, fractures of the long bones. Some individuals  at Morhiss exhibited fractures typically associated with violence such as  depression fractures, parry fractures, and cut wounds but these were  infrequent. There was a similar frequency of evidence of interpersonal violence  among burials at the Ernest Witte site, including a few burials that had imbedded  projectile points, the inferred cause of death.  These findings show that individual or group violence was a fact of life  during the Archaic on the West Gulf Coastal Plain. Nonetheless, evidence of violence was much less prevalent here  than among Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric populations in many areas of the  Southern Plains, including the central and northwestern parts of Texas.</p>
<p>Overall,  the results of Dockall&rsquo;s study indicate that the Morhiss population had better  health and suffered less trauma than inland hunter-gatherer groups in Texas and much of North America. </p></td>

	western diamondback rattlesnakes and were obviously strung together, but the position of the so-called 
	necklace suggests that it may have part of a belted garment or perhaps a bag that accompanied the
