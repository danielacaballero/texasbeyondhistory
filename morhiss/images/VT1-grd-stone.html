    <td class="text"><!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->These unusual stone artifacts were grave offerrings that show connections with distant source areas and with broad cultural patterns. From left to right, a drilled and polished black pendant, a drilled bannerstone, a grooved stone artifact ,  and a drilled piece of tabular sandstone. These artifacts are not ordinary everyday items; they were special artifacts that probably symbolized power and esotertic knowledge. The drilled pieces were probably worn as chest ornaments. These artifacts and the  grooved stone  are rare and most often found as grave offerings. Similar artifacts 
	were found in the Early Archaic cemetery at the  Buckeye Knoll site, a recently excavated site about 5 miles downstream from  Morhiss Mound. The bannerstone, pendants, and the grooved stone artifact suggest that  Morhiss inhabitants participated in a social network with far-reaching  extra-regional contacts to the northeast and east within the Eastern Woodlands.<!-- #EndEditable --></td>
