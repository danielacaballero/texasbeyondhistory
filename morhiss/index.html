	  <p>For  over 10,000 years native peoples of the coastal plains of southern Texas returned countless 
	  times to a prominent knoll overlooking the lower Guadalupe River not far south of Victoria, Texas. The 
	  deep layers of diverse occupational debris found within the knoll suggest that the <strong>Morhiss Mound </strong> site (41VT1) was a major campsite where prehistoric groups must have 
	  stayed during times of seasonal abundance (especially the fall nut harvest) and at other times as they 
	  moved up and down the river valley.  It also appears to have  been a favored locality for woodworking and stone-tool making. Time-sensitive artifacts from the site suggest that it was 
	    intermittently and heavily occupied throughout the long Archaic era. There were earlier and later occupations or at least visits as well, with a small amount of Paleoindian 
	    materials at the bottom and minor evidence of Late Prehistoric arrow points and pottery at the top 
	    along with a few fragments of Spanish Colonial era pottery.  The knoll also served as a burial ground for at least 5,000 years, during which  well over 200 individuals were interred. </p>
	  <p>This particular knoll may have been a one-of-a-kind locality, a place perfectly and uniquely situated 
  as a base camp from which those who stopped here could take advantage of the rich natural resources along 
  this stretch of the Guadalupe.  The knoll appears to have been safely above all but the biggest floods, 
  but close to  many  resources for food, shelter, and medicine, as well as a permanent source of water 
  and possibly rapid downstream transportation via simple rafts or dugout canoes.  There is clear evidence 
  that those who camped there frequently visited the nearby coast and brought back shells, asphaltum, and, 
  perhaps, fish and other marine resources.  Some of the shells were used to make tools while others 
  were fashioned into ornaments and beads, most of which were left as burial offerings. There were also 
  artifact caches and evidence of ritual, music, and ornamentation. All in all, the site was a very special 
  place in the past, and today ranks as one of the most significant archeological sites known from the region.</p> </td>

    <td width="480" height="401" valign="top"><p>When the site was first excavated in 1932, archeologists considered the Morhiss Mound to be an 
  artificial construction, an earthen mound purposefully built by piling up basketful after basketful of 
  fill.  Morhiss Mound was thought to have been created by prehistoric inhabitants of the area, suggesting 
  that it occupied a heretofore unknown intermediate cultural link between the distant civilizations of 
  Mesoamerica to the south and west and the chiefdoms with large earth mound constructions far to the east 
  in the Mississippi Valley.  We surmise that one of the prime reasons that archeologists excavated the 
  Morhiss Mound was to investigate this possibility, which later excavations in 1938-1940 were able to 
  rule out. </p> 
      <p>Rather than an artificial mound, Morhiss proved to be a  naturally raised feature (an old 
  floodplain terrace remnant) upon which occupational materials accumulated, thus adding incrementally to 
  the natural topographic relief.   Most archeologists today typically do not use the “mound” part of the 
  site’s name because that term is usually taken to mean a purposeful construction.  Naturally and 
  culturally mounded accumulation though it may be, the distinctive and evocative name by which it was first 
  known to archeologists has historical precedence.  Call it what you will: the Morhiss Mound site, the 
  Morhiss “Mound” site, the Morhiss site, or 41VT1.</p></td>

      <br>
      Although the story includes  fanciful speculation, it  conveys  the findings of the 1932 excavations and the archeological intepretations of the day quite  accurately.

    <p>We cannot yet tell the full story of the Morhiss Mound site even though it was essentially 
  completely excavated by archeologists from the University of Texas during a preliminary dig of modest 
  scope in 1932 and a large scale excavation in 1938-1940. This was during a time long before 
  the development of the modern techniques of scientific investigation and analysis that archeologists rely 
  on today.  The later excavations were well done by the standards of the day, but the fieldwork concluded 
  on the eve of World War II, and the site has never been fully analyzed and properly reported. </p> 
  <p>Fortunately, the collections and documents from the early work are housed at TARL and have proved 
  useful for a variety of completed and ongoing research projects.  These curated materials continue to 
  yield clues about the long succession of hunting, gathering, and fishing peoples who lived in the coastal 
  plains. What has been learned so far is quite fascinating and much more can and will be learned by 
  future researchers.  Perhaps this exhibit will help spark interest and maybe even the funding needed for 
  sophisticated analyses and full reporting. </p>
  
  <h3>Setting</h3>
  
<p>Location, location, location. The setting of the Morhiss site explains  a lot and gives us ample reason to suspect a great deal more.&nbsp; Located in southern Victoria  County, the site is on the lower Guadalupe River in one of the most productive  natural settings known in the region.&nbsp; The  natural diversity and richness of the setting stems from many forces and  sources:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>the  river&rsquo;s origin&#8212;the springs and upper drainage basin  upon the  Edwards Plateau; </li>
    <li>deep  alluvial sediments&mdash;sands, clays, and gravels derived from the Plateau and from  the Blackland Prairie and Post-Oak Savanna through which the river passes on  its way to Victoria County;</li>
    <li>an ever-changing  local landscape, a valley criss-crossed by water-carved features that twisted and turned through time; </li>
    <li>a relatively  wet and warm climate with over 37 inches of annual rainfall  and a long 285-day growing  season. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The lower  Guadalupe Valley  was once covered by dense woodland forests including major native pecan groves  and all sorts of specialized landforms and water features. These include major  tributaries such as Coleto Creek, which joins the river just downstream; side  channels; oxbow lakes (abandoned river channels); recent terraces; Ice-Age  terraces; nearby uplands; and the sparkling, deep-flowing waters of the river  itself. &nbsp;Each of these features and  interfaces created unique ecological niches supporting  varied plant and animal  communities. &nbsp;It might have been an  itchy, muddy paradise at times, but for peoples who lived off the land, it was  an ideal location. Arguably, no substantial subarea of the South Texas Plains  comes close to having the resource richness of the lower Guadalupe   Valley.</p>
  <p>More than  just  the local environs must have figured into the use of site.&nbsp; It was on a natural transportation route, an  ever-flowing river that linked the  natural regions of central Texas upstream with the  downstream river&rsquo;s terminus&#8212;the estuaries and barrier islands of the Texas Coastal  Bend.&nbsp; Downstream, the Guadalupe River is united  with its biggest tributary, the San Antonio  River, just above where the Guadalupe enters the  San Antonio Bay system.&nbsp; Morhiss Mound lies roughly 20 miles  inland from the northernmost point of San Antonio  Bay and about 40 miles from the  strandline of the Gulf of Mexico at Matagorda   Island. </p>
  <h3>Morhiss in Historical Perspective</h3>
  
<p>To  understand the site, one must also appreciate its time and place in the  development of American archeology and the beginnings of federal and state  archeological programs.&nbsp; Sites like  Morhiss Mound not only give us a window into the ancient human past, but also a  look at a transformative period in the development of archeology as a  scientific discipline.</p>
  <p>During  the 1930s, the American government had initiated efforts to put America back to  work.&nbsp; As part of this effort, the Works  Progress Administration was created as part of a federal mandate created by  President Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal Program.&nbsp; The principal aim of the WPA was to employ  citizens struggling to survive the Depression-era economy and archeology was a  good fit, a university-based discipline that could make good use of minimally  skilled laborers in many parts of the country. </p>
  <p>WPA  period archeology projects typically employed large numbers of people for  periods of time as they excavated one site after another.&nbsp; The sudden availability of lots of labor and  the need to keep the work going gave young college-trained archeologists  unprecedented opportunities for employment and research. The program&rsquo;s mandates  forced American archeologists to develop more systematic excavation methods and  documentation. And they had to produce results that could be quantified so that progress in usefully employing laborers could be demonstrated to the government.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>For researchers, the outcome of much of  this work was the accrual of large archeological collections, field notes, and  other documentation. Unfortunately, not long after the fieldwork  ended, so did the analysis of what was found. The WPA period of American  archeology was typified by delayed production of final reports, delayed  laboratory analyses, and a thin record of professional publications. Despite  these limitations, WPA archeology provided a wealth of new knowledge  pertaining to the archeology of North America  that is still being dealt with to this day, as this exhibit attests. </p>  </td>
