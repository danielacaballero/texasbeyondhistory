	<p>Morhiss Mound was first described in 1883 by the Victor M. Rose, an historian and the editor of Laredo Daily Times in a book on the early history of Victoria. Although the mounds height and size must be  exaggerated, the write left little doubt that he considered it an artificial construction. </p>
	<ul><p><em>&quot;The Mound,&quot;  an immense semi-cone shaped accumulation of earth, rising above the level alluvial deposits of the river to the height of 100 feet, is a curiousity. It is situated six miles south of the city of Victoria, on the east bank of the river, and is included in the farm of Mr. Morhis, who has erected upon the surface, which embraces an area of several acres, a house, and planted a peach orchard. </em></p>
	<p>[A similar mound,  the &quot;Peach knoll,&quot; is mentioned as being farther down river on the opposite bank.] </p>
	<p><em>These are identical with the works of mound-builders ... which have been partially explored in some states in the Mississippi Valley, yielding specimens of ancient pottery, skeletons, etc. </em>
	  &nbsp;Victor M. Rose, 1883 </p>	</ul>
	
	<p>Archeologists  may have first learned of the Morhiss site in 1930 when <strong>A.T. Jackson</strong> of the University of Texas  was told about a peculiarly large earthen mound along the Guadalupe  River near Victoria. Two years later, in May 1932, he attempted to  visit the site  and was unable to do so because it was surrounded  by the then-typical late spring floodwaters that inundated much of the  low-lying parts of the Guadalupe   River valley. (Such  floods are less frequent today due to the upstream Canyon Reservoir.) </p>
	<p>A  month later, in early June, Jackson and two field assistants were able to reach  the site, which was a large, tree-shrouded earthen mound measuring roughly 300-x-400&rsquo;  and 20&rsquo; high. They spent three days  digging two small trenches on one side of the mound, finding much evidence of  human occupation. Echoing Victor Rose, Jackson formed the opinion that the large mound was built by prehistoric peoples,  making it the only mound site known between east Texas  and northeastern Mexico  and a most important site.</p>
    <p>At  the time, Jackson was the field director of a  statewide archeological survey program at the University of Texas  under Professor <strong>James E. Pearce</strong>. Pearce  had begun the program in the mid-1920s, which was expanded in the early 1930s  with modest funding from the National Research Council. Jackson, a former newspaper reporter, became  Pearce&rsquo;s right-hand man and led small crews to prominent sites across the state  from Caddoan village sites in the Pineywoods of east Texas  to the dry caves of the Lower Pecos in southwest Texas.  By 1932, federal funding enabled Pearce and Jackson to hire assistant  archeologists and send out several crews in different parts of the state. His three-day work session at the Morhiss  Mound was, in fact, a scouting and planning mission. </p>
    <p>A  week later Jackson&rsquo;s  assistant, <strong>A. M. Woolsey</strong>, arrived at the site with a crew of four college  students. They spent three weeks  continuing Jackson&rsquo;s  trenches and starting two other trenches. This second phase of work resulted in  the excavation of a combined trench 4 feet wide and 160 feet long across an end  of the site. They dug down to as deep  as 11 feet, finding artifacts throughout a thick upper layer of &ldquo;black sandy  loam&rdquo; which capped deeply buried layers of sandy clay and &ldquo;white chalky  clay.&rdquo; Woolsey&rsquo;s short unpublished  manuscript on his work focuses mainly on ten human burials that were  encountered at various depths. These were each carefully exposed, photographed,  and individually described. Other finds  of complete artifacts (22 of which were listed), Ice-Age fossils, and the mound&rsquo;s  layering (stratigraphy) were mentioned without much understanding or detail. There are no surviving photographs of the  1932 work and only minimal documentation, most of it relating to the burials.</p>
    <p>The  1932 work showed that the knoll began as a natural remnant of a Pleistocene river  terrace, but Jackson and Woolsey believed that the thick dark layer that covered  the mound had been purposefully added.  They speculated that the black sandy loam had probably been obtained  from a nearby depression where dark soil was also present. This topographic feature is visible in the  aerial photos and is an obvious abandoned river channel filled-in with dark,  organic rich sediment superficially resembling the dark layer capping the  mound. The presence of numerous artifacts within the mound&rsquo;s black sandy loam  was interpreted as evidence that the seemingly homogenous layer was  artificially added, rather than a massive cultural deposit formed by gradual  accumulation over thousands of years. At  the time, little was known about the age and stylistic variations of stone  tools. Woolsey did realize that the site  must contain many more burials.</p>
	<p>By the  mid-1930s larger Federal programs, especially the make-work Works Progress  Administration (WPA) provided unprecedented amounts of funding for  archeological projects in many areas of the country. Unemployed workers were put to work carrying  out excavations under the direction of trained archeologists associated with  major universities. A.T. Jackson at the University of Texas oversaw many WPA projects between  1935 and 1940. Large-scale excavations were  undertaken at new sites and in new areas of the state as well as known sites  such as the Morhiss Mound. </p>
    <p>Between  October 1938 and January 1940 archeologist <strong>William A. Duffen</strong> and a large team of  30-40 WPA-paid workers succeeded in completely removing essentially all occupational  deposits associated with the site and the terrace remnant. The entire site was laid out in a grid  containing as many 5000 five-foot squares that served as excavation units, each  square given a unique alpha-numeric code.  During the 16-month excavation, most or all of the squares were excavated  to various depths. Vertically, the site  was excavated in 5-foot &ldquo;terraces&rdquo; that the workers followed, square by square,  across the site. </p>
    <p>These were essentially  what archeologists call &ldquo;arbitrary levels,&rdquo; but those used today typically  range from only 5 cm to 20 cm thick in order to maintain tight vertical  control. The system used in the WPA  excavations at Morhiss was adapted from similar strategies used at many of the  WPA projects overseen by Jackson. The system seems crude to archeologists  today, but it was a reasonable compromise for the day that allowed minimally  skilled workers to carry out large-scale systematic excavations. It was also a vast improvement over the  methods used during the Pearce-led era of the 1920s and early 1930s.</p>
    <p>Three  aspects of the Morhiss site can be said to have been the major research goals of  the WPA investigations: the Archaic cemetery, the Pleistocene fossil bones and  their possible association with Early Man, and the origin of the &quot;mound&quot; topography.  These goals and the evidence they yielded  are covered in the <a href="evidence.htm">Evidence</a> section, but here is how they impacted the  investigations.</p>
    <p>Over  200 burials were carefully exposed and systematically documented, a vast  improvement over cemetery excavations of earlier days. Although most of the Morhiss  excavations were done by pick and shovel, the workers were watching for  human bones and the most skilled excavators were called in to do the detailed work. Unfortunately,  we do not have any surviving photos or much discussion of the methods. But we can tell from the final documentation  photographs of the individual burials that they were excavated by  trowel and whisk broom by skilled excavators. </p>
    <p>The  archeologists were interested in the burial practices and associated grave goods, and  how these may have changed through time.  They also hoped the skeletal remains would prove informative to physical  anthropologists. Who were the people  buried at Morhiss Mound? How did they  relate to historic Indian peoples and to other prehistoric remains? The human remains have been examined by  several physical anthropologists and bioarcheologists through the years and  were the subject of a recent dissertation by <strong>Helen Dockall</strong> at Texas A&amp;M   University. Ongoing analyses are also being carried out  by other researchers. </p>
    <p>The  fossilized bones of extinct animals that were found in the lower, pre-midden  layers of the mound attracted considerable attention. Ice-Age animals were interesting in and of  themselves as relicts of a bygone colder era, but the archeologists had a  particular angle. Did Early Man, the term  used for the early inhabitants of North American whom we call Paleoindian  peoples today, coexist with the now-extinct beasts? </p>
    <p>In  the mid-1930s suggestive evidence of the association of fossil bones and  ancient artifacts had been found along the Berclair Terrace    not far to the west  in Bee   County by the Texas  Memorial Museum (TMM). The first TMM  director, <strong>E. H. Sellards</strong>, was a paleontologist who had taken on the investigation  of Early Man sites as his own research focus.  In fact, while the  WPA work at Morhiss was underway, the TMM carried out a smaller WPA excavation project at the Buckner Ranch site along the Berclair Terrace (see <a href="../st-plains/images/ap7.html">Buckner Ranch</a>). During this period,  Sellards  visited the Morhiss excavations and encouraged Duffen to  seek evidence of fossil bones and artifacts found together. In the end, only meager and doubtful evidence  of such an association was found, but the WPA crews spent a fair amount of time  looking and collecting fossils.</p>
    <p>The  question of whether the mound was a purposeful construction was very much a  major topic of interest. To Jackson&rsquo;s credit, he  seems to have sent Duffen to the field with the freedom to consider the  question anew. To understand how the  site formed, Duffen approached the mound from one direction and dug the squares side-by-side, so that a series of sections or profiles through the mound could  be studied and documented. He produced a  series of measured drawings and photographs of these exposures, not all of  which have survived. And he answered the  question, as we shall see in the next section. </p>
    <p>Although  there are apparent gaps in the surviving WPA records, a considerable amount of  information is preserved in the TARL archives including summary quarterly progress  reports, a topographic map, a schematic stratigraphic section drawing, numerous  black and white field photographs, systematic sets of feature and burial  records,and artifact documents such as inventories, classifications, descriptions,  photographs, and drawings. </p>
    <p>When this exhibit on Morhiss Mound was first published in September, 2006, the authors wrote  &quot;not  much is known about William Duffen.&quot; Happily,  that is no longer true. When he spied the TBH exhibit, a very much alive and well  99-year-old William &quot;Bill&quot; Duffen called from Tucson, Arizona to set us straight with several telephone interviews. </p>
    <p>Duffen did indeed have archeological training, as we surmised. He majored in archeology at the University of Arizona, where he earned his undergraduate degree and his M. A. in the early to mid-1930s. There he was trained by  several of the leading  scholars of the day, including Byron Cummings, the man  known to students and colleagues as &quot;The Dean&quot; of Southwest archeology. Bill Duffen also spent a summer working for  Andrew Douglas, who pioneered dendrochronology (tree-ring dating). After graduation Duffen spent a field season  helping to stabilize the cliff dwellings at Tonto National Monument. </p>
    <p>In 1938 Dean Cummings recommended Duffen to  &quot;Doc&quot; Pearce at the University of  Texas who was then searching for qualified archeologists to supervise  WPA projects. A telegram offer soon sent Bill and his wife to  packing with &quot;everything we owned.&quot; They soon  moved to Victoria where he was put in charge of  40 workers  and sent to excavate Morhiss Mound. It was a &quot;different kind of archeology altogether&quot; from that he had learned in  the Southwest. </p>
    <p>At first Duffen kept the men busy clearing the site, removing stumps, and establishing a site grid. The WPA budget was tight so he had the men fashion flattened grid stakes from hardwood tree limbs. But then it came time to begin excavation while he simultaneous trained the workers in archeological techniques. &quot;My tail was on fire trying to keep up,&quot; as he put it. </p>
    <p>The safety of his men was a chief concern. The site location was remote and each day required a long round trip through the brush, the men loaded into a large truck and Duffen driving his own car. Guadalupe River floods  came up pretty close to the mound several times, sending rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins   in search of higher ground. Periodic wet conditions resulted in the construction of a raised platform upon which the large canvas tent that served as Duffen's field office and equipment storage was placed. He recalls the deep trench they dug beneath the mound to try to establish its origins and recover Pleistocene fossils. A high water table made things &quot;mushy at the base of the mound&quot; and prevented Duffen from digging as deep as he would have liked. </p>
    <p>Duffen's systematic records, his WPA progress  reports, and the text of a 1939 paper he presented to the Texas Archeological  and Paleontologist Society (now, TAS) reveal that he was a keen observer. It was he who demonstrated that the mound was  not an artificial construction, but instead had formed by natural and cultural  accumulations over what he reasoned was a considerable span of time. In several places in his progress reports  Duffen expresses his anticipation of preparing a thorough final report. </p>
    <p>Alas, he was never given the opportunity to  do so. From Morhiss he went on to run excavations at the Yarborough site in east Texas and he took part in other excavations along the coast and the Colorado River west of Austin. Most WPA programs ended in the early years of World War II and Morhiss  is one of many major WPA archeological investigations in Texas and elsewhere across the country that were never properly  completed. </p>
    <p>William Duffen resigned from the WPA in 1941, intending to enlist in the army. A perforated ear drum sent him to Baltimore instead where he spent the war  building  planes. After the war he returned to Tucson, needing a job and soon began a second career as a high school history teacher.  Although he left archeology behind him, his unfinished work with Morhiss Mound ran &quot;through my mind all this time,&quot; as he put it on the verge of his 100th birthday. Were it not for the intervention of the war, Duffen thinks he might have stayed in archeology. &quot;I enjoyed that work in Texas.&quot; </p>
    
    
    <p>In  the succeeding six and a half decades since the field work ended at Morhiss, many archeologists have realized the  site&rsquo;s potential and several have tackled various parts of the daunting task of  doing thorough analyses of the materials, with some success. None of these efforts has yet succeeded in  carrying out comprehensive analysis, interpretation, and full reporting of  the site. This would require several  years of dedicated work and substantive funding so that modern analytical techniques  could be used. As a way of comparison, we estimate that the modern excavation  of a site similar to Morhiss Mound would take at least three years and millions of  dollars, and that&rsquo;s just the fieldwork. The analysis and reporting would take an  additional three to five  years and   several million dollars. With  much more sophisticated and probing research questions and state-of-the-art  techniques, much more would be learned.  The chances of a site like Morhiss Mound surviving mostly intact  over the last 65 years are next to nil, however, so we are lucky to have what we have. </p>
    <p>The  most useful overall appraisal of the site was done by the late Professor <strong>T. N.  Campbell</strong> of the University of Texas at Austin  in the early 1960s. Campbell reviewed the records and  reclassified some of the artifacts and set forth what he explicitly noted was a  preliminary and descriptive appraisal.  His summary was later published as an appendix in a 1976 archeological  report on the nearby Coleto Creek Reservoir (see <a href="images/Campbell-1976.pdf" target="_blank">Campbell 1976</a> <a href="images/Campbell-1976.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>).
    Along with Duffen&rsquo;s progress reports and 1939 paper, Campbell&rsquo;s appraisal guides much of what we  know today about the site.</p>    </td>
