            <p class="text">The story of Presidio San Sab&aacute; is the story 
              of Texas. It is the story of contentions and competing interests. 
              It is the story of the Spanish Colonial pursuits of God, glory, 
              and gold, and of the struggle of Native American groups to thwart 
              the foreign invaders. </p>
            <p class="text">Today the <i>presidio</i> (Spanish for &quot;fort&quot;) 
              lies in ruins, but it is not hard to imagine how it looked at its 
              height in the mid-1700s, when it was home to more than 300 Spanish 
              soldiers and civilians, some of them women and children. You can 
              picture the soldiers practicing drills in the presidio's open courtyard 
              while herders tended cattle and farmers worked the nearby fields. 
              With imagination, you might catch a whiff of fresh-baked bread and 
              meat roasting on a spit or hear children playing in the courtyard. 
              But then, suddenly, the reverie ends with the shout &quot;Fore!&quot; 
              followed by the sharp thwack of a metal club striking its target, 
              and then the quiet thud of a golf ball finding purchase on the green.</p>
            <p class="text">Today, Presidio San Sab&aacute; lies just outside 
              the town of Menard, Texas, at the western edge of the Texas Hill 
              Country. The presidio sits amid Menard's Municipal Golf Course, 
              not far from the clear, winding San Saba River. The standing stone 
              ruins are evocative, but they are not from the original 1760 stone 
              construction. Instead, they are the remnants of a past project to 
              reconstruct the presidio. In 1936 and 1937, a crew hired by the 
              Texas Centennial Commission and paid for by a grant from the Texas 
              Legislature reconstructed the northwest portion of Presidio San 
              Sab&aacute; as a tangible reminder of the past. These reconstruction 
              efforts, relatively faithful to the design of the original presidio, 
              began to deteriorate not long after their completion. Today they 
              are just a ruin, another crumbling testament to Texas history.</p>
            <p class="text">Presidio San Sab&aacute;, originally known as Presidio 
              San Luis de las Amarillas, was constructed in April of 1757 by a 
              Spanish force led by Captain Don Diego Ortiz Parilla. The presidio, 
              which was subsidized by the Spanish crown, had a threefold purpose: 
              to protect the nearby Mission Santa Cruz de San Sab&aacute;, to 
              assess the validity of rumors of rich silver deposits in the area, 
              and to guard the Spanish frontier against the threat of Indian encroachment. 
              The companion Mission Santa Cruz de San Sab&aacute; was built a 
              few miles downstream for the purpose of Christianizing the Lipan 
              Apache. But by soliciting the Apache, the Spanish unwittingly made 
              enemies of the Norte&ntilde;os, long-time foes of the Apache.</p>
            <p class="text">The Indian groups the Spanish called Norte&ntilde;os 
              (&quot;northerners&quot;) included various bands of the Comanche, 
              Wichita, Kitsai, and Caddo tribes who were united in their hatred 
              of the Apache. The Nortenos were also trading partners and sometimes 
              competitors whose territories covered a huge swath of the Southern 
              Plains and into the forests of East Texas. In March of 1758 a large 
              force of Nortenos attacked, looted, and burned Mission San Sab&aacute;, 
              less than one year after its founding (see the <i>Texas Beyond History</i> 
              exhibit on <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/sansaba/index.html">Mission 
              San Sab&aacute;</a>). The mission was never rebuilt, however, the 
              presidio lived on for another 14 years until hope for silver riches 
              waned. The presidio was abandoned in 1772 by order of the Viceroy 
              of New Spain.</p>
            <p class="text">Although the location of the mission was &quot;lost&quot; 
              for a number of years, the presidio site has always been obvious. 
              Archeological survey and testing was done there in 1967 by noted 
              Spanish Colonial archeologist Kathleen Gilmore, working for the 
              Texas State Building Commission, and again in 1981 by James Ivey 
              of the University of Texas at San Antonio. In June of 2000, students 
              of the Texas Tech University Archaeological Field School, under 
              the direction of Professor of Anthropology Dr. Grant Hall, began 
              the first formal excavations of the site. Texas Tech has returned 
              to Presidio San Sab&aacute; for the 2001 and 2002 field seasons, 
              under the direction of Hall and Dr. Tamra Walter, also a Texas Tech 
              anthropology professor. Texas Tech will continue its investigations 
              into the foreseeable future in cooperation with citizens of Menard 
              who hope to properly reconstruct parts of the fort and build an 
              interpretive center.</p>
            <p class="text">Three years of archeological excavations at the site 
              have yielded a great deal of information, both about the original 
              architecture of the presidio, traceable through vestiges of wall 
              foundations, and about the lives of the people who lived there, 
              represented by recovered artifacts. Artifacts from the site are 
              typical of the Spanish Colonial period in Texas: musket balls, gunflints, 
              horse equipment, hand-forged iron nails, and sherds of imported 
              ceramic olive jars, plates, and bowls.</p>
            <p class="text">Presidio San Sab&aacute; was chosen as the site 
              of the 2003 Texas Archeological Society Field School (see the Texas 
              Archeological Society's website: <a href="http://www.txarch.org" target="_blank" class="text">http://www.txarch.org</a>). 
              Volunteer excavators from all over the state convened in June 
              of that year to work alongside Texas Tech students.</p>
            <p class="text">At the time of its occupation in the mid-eighteenth 
              century, Presidio San Sab&aacute; was the lone bastion of Spanish 
              authority on an otherwise unoccupied frontier. Both in physical 
              size and by the size of its military force, it was the largest and 
              most important military installation in Texas at that time. No wonder 
              that it has been referred to by some as &quot;the ruin of ruins.&quot;</p>
