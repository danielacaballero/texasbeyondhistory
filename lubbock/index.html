				  <p class="text">For over 13,000 years the inhabitants and visitors 
                    to the Llano Estacado (Staked Plains) have frequented a locale 
                    known today as the Lubbock Lake Landmark. Until recently the 
                    main attraction was a major spring that flowed out of the 
                    Ogallala aquifer and into Yellowhouse Draw. The abundant water 
                    and sheltered draw was a haven for plants and animals. The 
                    water, plants, and animals drew humans, beginning with Clovis 
                    hunters and their families and continuing right on up into 
                    historic times, each leaving behind a few traces. The end 
                    result is an archeological record that has few parallels in 
                    the southern High Plains&#151;layer after layer reflecting 
                    changing climates, environments, and cultures. Archeologists 
                    and other scientists have been studying the Lubbock Lake site 
                    for over 65 years and there is still much to be learned from 
                    this remarkable locale.</p>
                  <p class="text">The place takes its name from a reservoir created 
                    in the 1930s in a U-shaped bend of Yellowhouse Draw, a tributary 
                    of the Brazos River. Up until the late 1880s, a natural, spring-fed 
                    lake existed in this same area. In the early 1900s, the springs 
                    began to dry up, the victim of too many thirsty people and 
                    their bountiful crops. In the late 1930s a project to dig 
                    out (and hopefully renew) the springs turned up Folsom points 
                    and other evidence of Paleoindian peoples. This led to the 
                    first archeological digs in 1939 and 1941 under the sponsorship 
                    of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). To run the excavation, 
                    W. Curry Holden, Director of the West Texas Museum (now the 
                    Museum of Texas Tech University) hired Joe Ben Wheat, a young 
                    Texan who would later become a noted Paleoindian expert. But 
                    everywhere the WPA crew dug, they soon hit water. While the 
                    springs never came back, the water table had been raised temporarily 
                    by the creation of the artificial reservoir. The Folsom deposits 
                    lay deep below the water table and only a few Paleoindian 
                    artifacts were recovered.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the late 1940s, irrigation wells had drawn 
                    down the water table considerably lower, making the Folsom-age 
                    deposits accessible. Holden permitted new excavations to be 
                    carried out under the direction of E.H. Sellards, Director 
                    of the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM) at UT Austin. Sellards 
                    and his TMM teams had been exploring a series of &quot;Early 
                    Man&quot; sites including the famous Blackwater Draw in eastern 
                    New Mexico. Geologist Glen Evans and paleontologist Grayson 
                    Meade were in charge of the intermittent field work between 
                    1948-1955 at Lubbock Lake. The main excavations were undertaken 
                    in 1950-1951. Taking advantage of the lower water tables and 
                    the almost vertical walls of the dredged-out waterway, Evans 
                    and Meade were able to document a complex sequence of natural 
                    and cultural deposits including bone beds associated with 
                    Folsom artifacts. Glen Evans' color photographs can be seen

                  <p class="text"> Since 1972, the Lubbock Lake Landmark has been 
                    investigated by archeologist Dr. Eileen Johnson and geoarcheologist 
                    Dr. Vance Holliday and their students and associates. Field 
                    research has taken place almost every summer. The hallmark 
                    of their work has been meticulous documentation borne out 
                    of the realization that at Lubbock Lake most archeological 
                    deposits are the result of one-time events. Here the smallest 
                    trace can be a crucial clue to unraveling a &quot;day-in-the-life&quot; 
                    occupational episode&#151;a bison kill, an overnight camp, 
                    a meal&#151;sealed by the almost unbroken deposition of wind-borne 
                    dust, overbank flood mud, or pond and marsh deposits.</p>
                  <p class="text">Lubbock Lake is now a state and federal historic 
                    landmark protected by a 336-acre preserve on the north side 
                    of the city of Lubbock, Texas. The park contains the Lubbock 
                    Lake Landmark (which includes a series of nearby archeological 
                    locales along Yellowhouse Draw), an interpretive center, and 
                    a research center operated by the Museum of Texas Tech University. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Today anyone can visit the interpretive center, 
                    see the incredible outdoor display of life-size bronze statues 
                    of Ice-Age animals, and sign up to participate in workshops 
                    and tours. This is one of the most accessible archeological 
                    and paleontological sites in Texas.. The interpretive center 
                    has a very active public education program that involves thousands 
                    of school children in the region every year. Check out the

			      <p class="text">Under the archeological leadership of Dr. Eileen 
                    Johnson, the <a href="http://txarch.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#800000">Texas 
                    Archeological Society</font></a> (TAS) held its 33rd annual 
                    field school at Lubbock Lake Landmark June 3-11, 1993. Some 
                    225 TAS members carried out site surveys and excavations at 
                    various locales within the Landmark and at several ranches 
                    elsewhere in the area. The biggest challenge was the relentless 
                    wind and the dusty bone-dry conditions it brought. The campers' 
                    tents &quot;shook and flapped, and some collapsed&quot; as 
                    Dr. E. Mott Davis put it. In hindsight, it seems fitting that 
                    those taking part in the field school had to face the exact 
                    same forces of nature that shaped the Lubbock Lake Landmark 
                    throughout its history. You can get a good look at many of
