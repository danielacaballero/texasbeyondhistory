                  <p class="text">The murals and dioramas created for the Lubbock 
                    Lake Landmark by artists Nola Davis and Mike O'Brien of the 
                    Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) provide vivid depictions 
                    of prehistoric life based on archeological evidence. The most 
                    spectacular pieces are the life-sized sculptures of Ice-Age 
                    animals created by O'Brien and other artists that grace the 
                    landscape around the interpretive center. Walking up to these 
                    huge beasts really gives you an appreciation for the earliest 
                    Paleoindian hunters who crept around Yellowhouse Draw waiting 
                    for an opportunity to hurl their puny spears at such formidable 
                    prey. Big Game Hunters, indeed!</p>
                  <p class="text">All of the images below are details of larger 
                    murals and dioramas. The titles and descriptions used here 
                    were coined just for this web exhibit. At the Lubbock Lake 
                    Landmark Interpretive Center you can see the complete murals 
                    and dioramas as they were intended to be shown.</p>
                  <p class="text">The details shown in these reconstructions are 
                    based carefully on archeological research and on other sources 
                    of information. Dr. Eileen Johnson and her staff at the Lubbock 
                    Lake Landmark provided the TPWD artists with detailed descriptions 
                    of actual archeological deposits from which the scenes were 
                    inferred. Other details are based on early historic accounts, 
                    recorded ethnographic observations, and environmental and 
                    climatic data. </p>
