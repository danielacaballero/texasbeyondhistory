                  <p class="text">These photographs were taken in 1950-1951 by 
                    Glen Evans, during field work at Lubbock Lake undertaken by 
                    the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM) under E. H. Sellards, Director 
                    of the TMM. Sellards and his team of geologists investigated 
                    many different &quot;Early Man&quot; sites in the southern 
                    Plains of Texas and New Mexico: Blackwater Draw (NM), Miami 
                    (TX), and Kincaid Shelter (TX), among them. Geologist Glen 
                    Evans and vertebrate paleontologist Grayson Meade directed 
                    the field investigations at Lubbock Lake. </p>
                  <p class="text">The TMM work focused on the Folsom-age deposits, 
                    now known to date to 10,000-11,000 RCYB (radiocarbon years 
                    before present) or roughly 11,500 to 12,500 years ago. In 
                    1952, William Libby, the man who developed radiocarbon dating, 
                    obtained a radiocarbon date of 9883 +/- 350 B.P. from bones 
                    recovered by the TMM that were thought to be associated with 
                    the Folsom culture. Although subsequent geological work determined 
                    that the dated material came from the somewhat later Plainview 
                    deposits at Lubbock Lake, this was a historically important 
                    step in confirming the age of early Paleoindian cultures in 
                    the southern High Plains.</p>
