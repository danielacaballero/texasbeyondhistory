              <p>The investigation of a rather ordinary
                  prehistoric  campsite overlooking a small tributary
                  of the Llano River in western Mason County gave archeologists
                  much insight into <strong>hot rock cooking</strong>, the process
                  that left its permanent mark at tens of thousands of localities across
                  the Plateaus and Canyonlands region. The most obvious &ldquo;marks&rdquo; left
                  by hot rock cooking are the two most common archeological features&#8212;<strong>burned rock middens</strong> and <strong>hearths</strong>. Middens are large mounded accumulations of fire-cracked cooking
                  rocks and other debris generated by <strong>earth oven facilities</strong> used over
                  and over to bake plants. &quot;Hearths&quot; are relatively small circular
                  patterns of cooking rocks that represent individual cooking
                  episodes quite similar to those that resulted in the midden
                  accumulation.</p>
                <p>What makes the Honey Creek site (41MS32) extraordinary is
                  not the nature of the site itself, but what was learned from
                  it. The site was excavated in 1987-1988 by an archeological
                  team from the Texas Department of Transportation led by Glenn T. Goode, 
                  prior to its destruction by a road widening project. A few
                  years later, a research team from the Texas Archeological Research
                  Laboratory (TARL, UT Austin) led by Steve Black analyzed the field results as
                  part of a larger study of four similar &ldquo;burned rock midden&rdquo; sites. The Honey Creek site proved
                  especially informative because both the field and the lab teams
                  asked timely questions and were able to marshall the data needed to answer most of their
                  questions.</p>                
                <h3><strong><a name="Hotrock"></a>Hot Rock Cooking at Honey Creek </strong></h3>
                  <p>In the late 1980s, researchers were beginning to understand
                    how and why burned rock middens formed, but they hadn&rsquo;t
                    quite put the pieces together. A sketch of the history of
                    midden interpretation can be found in the <a href="../bowie/middenwhat.html">Camp
                    Bowie exhibit</a>.
                    The analysis of the Honey Creek site helped pull research
                    threads together because the site had yielded the &ldquo;right stuff&rdquo;&#8212;well-preserved, charred plant remains, good field documentation,
                    and <strong>really good dirt</strong>&#8212;dozens of soil samples collected
                    from within the midden and from individual oven features.</p>
                  <p>What archeologists classify as &quot;burned rock midden sites&quot;
                    are  open campsites containing one or
                    more middens and various other features such as hearths.
                    In other words, middens are special site features, not sites in and
                    of themselves. At the Honey Creek site there was only one
                    small midden about 45 feet in diameter (13-x-15 meters)
                    and less than two feet thick. Because the field archeologists
                    carefully weighed samples of the burned rocks making up the
                    midden, the total mass could be calculated &ndash;12.5 metric
                    tons or so (about 27,600 pounds). And this is just a 
                    small midden. At some sites in the region, individual middens
                    cover several acres and must have  a mass of well over
                    a hundred metric tons.</p>
                  <p><strong>What caused native peoples to amass all these fire-cracked
                    rocks in one place?</strong> Plant baking. They baked plants with 
                    heated limestone rocks in layered cooking arrangements known
                    as <strong>earth ovens</strong>. You can read more about earth ovens  elsewhere in
                    this website, but consider a few telling numbers from the
                    midden at the Honey Creek site. We can calculate,  at least
                    crudely, the number of plant baking episodes it took to form
                    this smallish midden. Based on field data and experimental
                    work, an average-size individual earth oven required the
                    use of roughly  500 lbs of cooking rocks. Dividing this into
                    the total midden mass (27,600 lbs), we get 52 ovens. But,
                    experimental work shows  that a good cooking rock could
                    be used about three times before it cracked into pieces too
                    small to be reused. So, multiple 52 by 3 and we arrive at
                    a projection of 156 ovens. To recap, the total mass of the
                    small midden at the Honey Creek site is estimated to represent
                    the accumulated debris resulting from perhaps 156 oven-baking
                    episodes. <strong>But what was being cooked in the ovens?</strong></p>
                  <p>We can answer that question because Goode carefully collected
                    10-liter soil matrix samples from 16 individual hearth/oven
                    features as well as samples from various areas within the
                    midden. During the analysis phase, archeobotantist Phil Dering,
                    an archeologist and botanist then at Texas A&amp;M University, &ldquo;floated&rdquo; each
                    matrix sample. This means he used a water flotation processing
                    technique to skim off the &ldquo;light fraction&rdquo; charred
                    plant remains for identification&#8212;the charred bits float,
                    rocks and bones sink. Once the light fraction samples dried,
                    Dering spent many hours identifying the genus, and species
                    of plants represented by the small charred fragments. He did this by comparing
                    the archeological specimens to &ldquo;known&rdquo; samples
                    of charred modern plants collected especially for comparative study.</p>
                  <p>Check out the accompanying summary list of the identified
                    plant remains found in the Honey Creek midden. This is a fascinating assortment of plants and  includesonly the potentially edible plants. At least 14
                    different kinds of charred wood were also recovered from
                    the midden&#8212;oak wood (live oak and red oak) was the
                    most common, followed by persimmon, hackberry, walnut, juniper, buckthorne, and others. It looks like  the Honey Creek cooks burned
                    any dry wood their children could lay their hands on. (In
                    hunting and gathering societies, everyone pitched in and
                    the task of fetching firewood usually fell to children.)
                    And there were no log fragments, all of the firewood appears
                    to have been harvested as stick-sized chunks&#8212;dead
                    limbs and twigs that could be easily broken off and hauled
                    back to camp.</p>
                  <p>The edible parts&mdash;seeds, nuts, stalks, bulbs, hearts, leaves, or pads&mdash;of at least nine different plant species 
                    were found in the midden. But most of the nuts and seeds
                    from plants such as Indian cherry, goosefoot, hackberry,
                    and oak don&rsquo;t need to be baked. These (and various
                    animal bone fragments) are thought to represent ordinary
                    cooking debris from other kinds of cooking activities that took place
                    in the midden area. (Only plant baking requires lots of hot
                    rocks and here we are trying to explain why the heap of spent
                    cooking rocks formed.) Among the charred plants from the
                    Honey Creek midden, the most likely baking candidates are
                    prickly pear pads, sotol and perhaps yucca leave bases (hearts), and
                    the bulbs of lily family plants such as wild onions. Visit
                    the <a href="../plateaus/nature/plant.html">Plant Gallery</a> in the Nature&rsquo;s Harvest section for
                    details about how these plants were used.</p>
                  <p>The charred identified plant fragments were also used for
                    radiocarbon dating. The accompanying graph tells the dating
                    story. The Honey Creek midden formed over a 600-year time
                    span between about A.D. 1100-1700, during the Late Prehistoric
                    period and the very early historic era. Now let&rsquo;s finish
                    the numbers.</p>
                  <p>As explained, the small midden at the Honey Creek site is
                    estimated to have formed from the accumulated debris generated
                    by perhaps 156 ovens (individual plant-baking episodes).
                    That sounds like a lot, but not when you factor in time&#8212;the
                    midden formed over a 600 year period. That means we could
                    account for the accumulation of spent cooking stones (i.e.,
                    the midden) if small bands of hunter-gatherers had stopped at the site merely
                    every 3.8 years and fired up only a single
                    oven each time.</p>
                  <p>Of course it must not have happened so regularly. More likely,
                    family bands of 15-20 people came to the Honey Creek site once every generation
                    or so and did quite a bit of baking for a few days or a week
                    or two. That would also help explain why  additional
                    ovens were found outside the midden&#8212;the site may
                    have been a busy place during the peak availability of baking
                    plants. These site use episodes probably didn&rsquo;t occur
                    very often simply because it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for
                    an experienced family of gatherers to harvest all the nearby
                    mature sotol plants or dig out a thick nearby patch of wild
                    onions. Once heavily harvested, these plants take many
                    years to grow back into a dense stand. In other words, it
                    is likely that people came to the site to bake plants only
                    when the targeted plants in the immediate area were ripe
                    for the picking and that probably didn&rsquo;t happen all
                    that often.</p>
                  <p>Such educated guesses are just that: educated guesses or
                    <strong>interpretations</strong> based on the facts as we archeologists know
                    them at the time and on as many lines of evidence as we can
                    bring together. It is our job to read between the lines of
                    evidence and put forth a solid argument and plausible interpretation.
                    As archeologists investigate more sites like the Honey Creek
                    site and ask the right questions, we will learn more and
                    come up with improved interpretations and better educated
                    guesses about what happened in the past. This is how archeology

                    The Honey Creek site in southwestern Mason County may have been 
                    a rather ordinary archeological site, but it yielded some fascinating insight
                    into the prehistory of the Plateaus and Canyonlands. </p>
                  <p><strong><a name="recycling"></a>Prehistoric Recycling: The Case of the Battered
                  Martindale </strong></p>
                  <p>Take a look at the photo on the left labeled &ldquo;Recycled
                    Point.&rdquo; This Martindale dart point is of a style made in
                    late Early Archaic times, perhaps 7000-8000 years ago (5000-6000
                    B.C.). But it was found in the upper deposits at the Honey
                    Creek just north of the midden along with a hodge-podge mix
                    of arrow points, a few dart points, and other stone tools,
                  several of which show evidence of recycling</p>
                  <p>At first glance, this cluster of artifacts (Cluster 6 as shown on plan map
                    on the right) might be considered  a &ldquo;mixed-age&rdquo; accumulation
                    of artifacts made thousands of years apart and too mixed
                    up to make any sense of. But close study reveals a different
                    story. The  northern edge of the Honey Creek midden appears to be an area where stone tools were
                    made and used during the same period the midden formed (A.D.
                    1100-1700). The arrow points (most of which were broken as they were being made) date to that time. But the Martindale and several
                    other dart points appear to have been recycled tools, probably
                    reused on the spot by the later arrowhead-making peoples. Study
                    the enlarged photo of the recycled point, read the caption, and then come back
                    and read the following.</p>
                  <p>Here is what we think these details observed on the Martindale
                    point may mean. The original point was made, used for deer hunting,
                    and discarded  at the end of its &ldquo;use life&rdquo; by
                    its original owner some 7000-8000 years ago. The point was
                    probably left behind after it was used and resharpened several
                    times, rendering it too short, stubby, and dull for a proper hunting point&mdash;most
                    dart points were discarded for similar reasons. For thousands
                    of years the Martindale point just lay there, slowly developing patina.</p>
                  <p>Much later,  during the 600-year period the Honey
                    Creek midden was in use (A.D. 1100-1700), somebody spied
                    the Martindale point lying on the ground and picked it up. Or perhaps they found it while scraping up a basket of dirt to help seal an earth oven. 
                    However it was found, somebody realized it could be used to make a  simple cutting
                    or scraping tool. Grabbing a convenient
                    hammerstone, the person
                    quickly knocked off a few small chips (small flakes) from
                    the edge of the point to create a fresh, sharp edge. A sharp
                    edge would be useful for many everyday tasks, just like you
                    use a pocket knife or a pair of scissors. Daily task accomplished,
                    the recycled point was soon  abandoned again.</p>
                  <p>Hundreds of years later, Glenn Goode spotted
                    this Martindale point during the excavations and socked it
                    away in a properly labeled bag. And a few years later, Steve
                    Black opened the bag and looked closely at this specimen and others from the
                    site and came up with this explanation. Such &ldquo;just-so&rdquo; stories
                    must be recognized for what they are and taken with a grain
                    of salt. We&rsquo;ll never know the details of exactly what
                    happened 700 years ago. But the details don&rsquo;t really
                    matter as much as understanding the pattern to answer the
                    question&#8212;why was a battered old dart point with freshly
                    chipped edges found amid much younger artifacts? We can be
                    confident that <strong>native peoples were practiced recyclers throughout
                    prehistoric times</strong>. This old, commonsense habit probably accounts
                    for considerable &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; of materials of different
                    ages in archeological deposits. </p>

				  <div class="caption"> This intact oven bed was found near the center of the Honey Creek midden.  The concrete goat shed wall ran right over it, but did no harm.  Notice the dark carbon-stained midden soil found in the central area of the midden. Oven after oven was built and rebuilt in this "black hole" at the center of the midden.   Each oven episode involved cleaning out the debris leftover from the last one, pitching out the small fire-cracked rocks and recycling those still big enough to be useful. New cooking rocks were added as necessary and a roaring fire was built to heat the rocks.  A wooden pole may have been used to form an even circular bed of hot rocks upon which layers of plant food and packing material were heaped, capped by a thick layer of earth to hold in the steamy heat.  Two days later, the baked bulbs and roots were ready to eat. When the food was removed, the oven bed remained intact.  So, the bed seen here is probably the remains of the last oven ever built in the Honey Creek midden.  TARL archives. </div></td>

				  <div class="caption">Close up of a recycled biface fragment.  This biface was never finished and probably rejected because it had a thick spot marked by the triangular patch of cortex (outer surface) in the lower left.  Abandoned, it aged and formed a dark patina - seen here as the dark gray-brown surface in the middle of the artifact.  Much later in time, during the period the midden was in use, someone picked up the reject and found a new use for it.  This is obvious because of the fresh flaking around the edge (the lighter colored areas).  Such recycling was a common practice among the native peoples of the region, but one that archeologists have been slow to recognize.   We now realize that artifacts sometimes had a long "use life" sometimes interrupted by thousands of years.  Such messy facts can make archeological interpretation quite challenging.
