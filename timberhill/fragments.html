                    Parsons and Bruseth wrote after the excavations were over 
                    and the analyses complete. How could the archeologists be 
                    so sure? The six days of excavation had netted a mere 1,307 
                    artifacts&#151;including hundreds of thumbnail-sized pottery 
                    sherds&#151;a small number, even for such a brief excavation. 
                    The archeologists were certain about the site's identity because 
                    the artifacts confirmed the information gleaned from historical 
                    documents and maps. Step by step, 10-cm level by10-cm level, 
                    they had to put together the last pieces of the puzzle. </p>
                  <p class="text">First they had to establish that the site was 
                    occupied by Caddo people, and not just any Caddo people, but 
                    members of the Kadohadacho families who lived during the right 
                    time period. What was their evidence?</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="text">Most importantly, the site is in the exact 
                      location shown on the most detailed of the historical maps, 
                      and the artifacts show that the village was occupied during 
                      the time when the Kadohadachos are known to have been at 
                      Timber Hill.</li>
                    <li class="text">A number of the artifacts recovered demonstrated 
                      that the occupation of the site was by Native Americans 
                      rather than early Euro-American settlers. These included 
                      a conical metal arrowpoint, silver ornaments, glass beads, 
                      thimbles perforated for use as tinklers on clothing, a hawk 
                      bell used in a similar manner, a spoon handle modified for 
                      use as a scarifier or fish scaler, and sherds of glass with 
                      edges flaked to make cutting and scraping tools.</li>
                    <li class="text">The decorations on pottery sherds were similar 
                      to those found at other historic Caddo sites in the region. 
                      In a sizable proportion of the pottery sherds (41 percent), 
                      shell was used as a tempering agent, as opposed to crushed 
                      bone, for example, or sand. A tempering agent is a solid 
                      material added to the moist clay to improve structure and 
                      reduce shrinkage during drying and firing. A large percentage 
                      of the pottery from the Kadohadacho homeland in the Great 
                      Bend of the Red River is also tempered with shell, but shell 
                      temper is uncommon in ceramics from other Caddo sites near 
                      Timber Hill. This provided some evidence that the Timber 
                      Hill people were originally from the Kadohadacho homeland.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="text">How did the archeologists know the artifacts 
                    were remnants of life from the brief period 1800-1840, when 
                    the Kadohadachos lived at Timber Hill? Most were of European 
                    or Euro-American manufacture, though the villagers had modified 
                    some of them to suit their own purposes. So the site was clearly 
                    occupied after the Caddos had extensive contact with European 
                    settlers. Even more telling, the manufacturing dates of some 
                    artifacts could be determined with a fair amount of precision. 
                    The handle of one pewter spoon could have been manufactured 
                    only between 1810 and 1840, for example, and a piece of English 
                    pottery bore a maker's mark used only from 1834 to 1836.</p>
                  <p class="text">Especially interesting was a military button 
                    made between 1827 and 1839. Military coats were common gifts 
                    to Indian leaders, and Sibley wrote of such a presentation 
                    at an 1807 meeting in Natchitoches, Louisiana, with Chief 
                    Dehahuit and another Caddo official:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>I gave the Caddo Chief a Scarlet Regimental 
                      Coat trim'd with Black Velvet and white Plated Buttons. 
                      At the same time gave the Son of Carody the Old Caddo Chief 
                      a Blue Half Regimental Coat trim'd with Scarlet and a White 
                      Linnen Shirt.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">The archeologists noted that this meeting occurred 
                    in 1807 and the button was manufactured later, but it was 
                    likely that the presentations continued and that the recovered 
                    specimen was from such a gift.</p>

                          that the excavated area might have been a plaza area, 
                          where villagers gathered for ceremonies and dances.</div>

                    posthole patterns or other remains that would indicate the 
                    location of residential and other structures. But the only 
                    such remains found within the 63 square meters excavated were 
                    two isolated postholes, one large and one small, and the diffuse 
                    outline of a smudge pit. </p>
                  <p class="text">The postholes did not produce useful information, 
                    but the smudge pit yielded important data about subsistence 
                    activities. Smudge pits are common features at Caddo sites, 
                    found both within houses and outside. They are small pits 
                    filled with fuels chosen for their ability to produce smoke. 
                    The most widely accepted explanation for the function of smudge 
                    pits is that they were for curing hides. Deer hides were especially 
                    important to Caddos and other Native American groups in the 
                    historic period, since deer hides were an important item of 
                    trade with the Euro-American settlers (it is said that the 
                    use of the term &quot;buck&quot; to refer to a dollar reflects 
                    the economic importance of deer hides in frontier trade). 
                    The hides were pinned into a baglike shape and suspended over 
                    the smoking pit for curing. A common fuel was corn cobs, and 
                    charred corn cobs and a peach pit from the smudge pit are 
                    the only direct evidence of foods recovered to date from Timber 
                    Hill. </p>

                  <h3>More Questions</h3>
                  <p class="text">Besides verifying the site's identity, the archeologists 
                    wanted to find out how closely the people at Timber Hill followed 
                    traditional Caddo ways, and how much they had adopted Euro-American 
                    ways. They determined that even though the Caddos had access 
                    to metal containers, and did use them, they also continued 
                    to create their own traditional ceramics. They tempered their 
                    ceramics with a variety of substances&#151;grog (crushed pottery), 
                    shell, or bone&#151;according to each vessel's function, a 
                    technique handed down through the generations.</p>
                  <p class="text">In addition, paleoethnobotanist Eileen Goldborer 
                    conducted a detailed study of the corn remains from Timber 
                    Hill and concluded that the residents were still raising two 
                    of their traditional corn varieties. They apparently had not 
                    yet adopted the more productive Southern Dent variety.</p>
                  <p class="text">Because historical sources suggested that by 
                    the time the Kadohadachos settled at Timber Hill, they were 
                    an amalgamation of several formerly distinct populations, 
                    the researchers were also curious about whether any evidence 
                    of this would show up at the site. There was just one hint. 
                    About 10 percent of the pottery sherds at Timber Hill were 
                    from clay vessels with surfaces that had been textured by 
                    brushing before firing. This technique was extremely rare 
                    in the original Kadohadacho homeland of the Great Bend of 
                    the Red River. Therefore, it's possible that this pottery 
                    was the work of non-Kadohadachos who had joined the community. 
                    It's also possible, of course, that the Timber Hill people 
                    obtained the brushed pottery or learned the technique from 
                    other groups.</p>
                  <p class="text">Quite a few questions remain for future researchers 
                    to explore. For instance, why did the archeologists find relatively 
                    few artifacts, little evidence of structures, and no trash 
                    middens? The excavated area could have been a ceremonial plaza 
                    or dance ground that was kept relatively clean, or it could 
                    have been a portion of the village that was inhabited for 
                    only a brief time. Either way, large components of the settlement, 
                    possibly scattered over several miles along Jim's Bayou, have 
                    yet to be uncovered. More extensive excavations would likely 
                    reveal more postholes and middens filled with artifacts.</p>
                  <p class="text">With more excavation, archeologists might be 
                    able to determine whether the formerly distinct groups that 
                    contributed to the population of Timber Hill lived in separate 
                    areas of the village, especially if their native ceramics 
                    were noticeably different from traditional Kadohadacho pottery. 
                    If enough excavation is done, it might be possible to trace 
                    the history of the village as it responded to population loss 
                    from disease. And with luck, archeologists could locate structures 
                    associated with political and religious leaders, and in this 
                    way better understand the social hierarchy at Timber Hill.</p><br>
