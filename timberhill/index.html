                    <span class="text">Deep in the swampy woods of East Texas 
                    near the Louisiana border, Texas Historical Commission archeologists 
                    found some pieces of broken pottery and glass, a handful of 
                    beads, a couple of buttons, and other odds and ends. It wasn't 
                    much, but they knew they had finally solved an old mystery, 
                    the exact location of a certain Caddo Indian village occupied 
                    from 1800 to about 1840. The collection of artifacts, though 
                    meager, was doubly precious to some of the volunteers on the 
                    excavation crew&#151;descendants of the 19th-century inhabitants 
                    of the settlement. Called Sha'chahd&iacute;nnih (Timber Hill), 
                    it was the last village of the Kadohadacho Caddos in their 
                    native homeland, a place still of great emotional and spiritual 
                    importance to modern Caddos. It contains the last vestiges 
                    of more than a thousand years of Caddo occupation of Texas, 
                    which came to an end in 1859 when they were removed from a 
                    north central Texas reservation to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. 
                    </span></p>
                  <p class="text">The village itself was not very old when it 
                    was abandoned&#151;Caddos had lived there for some 40 years. 
                    The original home of the Kadohadachos centered on the Great 
                    Bend of the Red River, but smallpox and Osage Indian attacks 
                    had forced them to move time after time down the Red River.</p>
                  <p class="text">By the time these moves began in 1788, the core 
                    group, called the Cadodacho or Grand Caddo, had consolidated 
                    with several formerly distinct Caddo villages in the vicinity 
                    to form the cultural unit known as the Kadohadacho, and as 
                    they moved downriver they absorbed another closely related 
                    population, the Petit Caddo. Once in their Timber Hill village, 
                    the Kadohadachos sympathetically allowed other Native American 
                    immigrants into their territory, most notably the Coushattas 
                    and Alabamas, who had been driven west by continuous white 
                    pressure.</p>
                  <p class="text">What forced the move to Timber Hill was nothing 
                    less than a natural disaster&#151;a huge mass of timber and 
                    debris that dammed up the Red River, forcing water out of 
                    its banks and onto the surrounding land. This &quot;Great 
                    Raft&quot; created Caddo Lake. The Kadohadachos could see 
                    that their village, which was on a floodplain, would soon 
                    be inundated, so in 1800 they sought safer ground.</p>
                  <h3>The People of Timber Hill</h3>
                  <p class="text">The Kadohadacho were one of three major Caddo 
                    divisions. The other two were the Hasinai and the Natchitoches. 
                    The Hasinai were the most numerous, but the Kadohadachos were 
                    said to be the most respected among other Caddos. By the time 
                    they had been at Timber Hill for five years, their numbers 
                    had been reduced to about 450 adults, but the Kadohadachos 
                    still exercised a great deal of authority over related tribes. 
                    John Sibley, a Natchitoches physician and Indian agent, wrote 
                    in 1805 that the Kadohadacho warriors were &quot;looked upon 
                    somewhat like the Knights of Malta, or some distinguished 
                    military order. They are brave, despise danger or death, and 
                    boast that they have never shed white men's blood.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">Not only did they pride themselves on not killing 
                    European settlers, the Caddos had long acted as intermediaries 
                    between the Europeans and other tribes, as well as among the 
                    various tribes of the region. They were considered important 
                    political and economic allies by the governments of France, 
                    Spain, Mexico, and the United States. During the time he lived 
                    at Timber Hill, powerful Chief Dehahuit honored a request 
                    from the Indian agency in Natchitoches to serve as a traveling 
                    diplomatic ambassador to the tribes bordering Caddo territory. 
                    His task was to persuade them to remain peaceful and friendly 
                    toward both Americans and Spaniards while the two nations 
                    were coming to terms over the Louisiana Purchase. Indian agent 
                    Sibley described Dehahuit as &quot;a remarkably shrewd and 
                    sensible fellow.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">Life at Timber Hill, aside from politicking, 
                    was probably a cycle of traditional religious practices, farming&#151;they 
                    raised corn, beans, and pumpkins&#151;and hunting. Every year 
                    in November almost all the able-bodied men left for four months 
                    to hunt on the buffalo plains to the northwest.</p>
                  <p class="text">But by November of 1830, when Chief Dehahuit 
                    led his men on the annual hunt, leaving behind women, children, 
                    and old or disabled men, the village's situation was dire. 
                    People were starving. Drought and flood had ruined their crops 
                    year after year. Other tribes driven into Caddo territory 
                    and Euro-American settlers had killed almost all the once-plentiful 
                    game. Indian hunters from Timber Hill had already been decimated 
                    by disease: The year they moved to the site, smallpox killed 
                    almost half of them; three years later, measles took more. 
                    &quot;The village on the lake became a place of crying,&quot; 
                    wrote noted Caddo historian Cecile Carter.</p>
                  <p class="text">All the while, settlers were pushing westward, 
                    ever hungry for more land. The huge logjam that had forced 
                    the Caddos to move from their floodplain village now protected 
                    Timber Hill from encroachment, as it prohibited boat passage 
                    on the middle Red River. But plans were underway to remove 
                    the Great Raft&#151;a battering-ram steamboat had been invented 
                    to break it up. Work began in 1833, the same year Chief Dehahuit 
                    died, and by April 1835 the Red was cleared, opening river 
                    traffic all the way to Shreveport. Now nothing could stop 
                    the white invasion of Caddo territory.</p>
