                    <span class="text">Hungry, dispirited, and recognizing the 
                    inevitable, the Caddos agreed to sell their Louisiana lands 
                    to the United States in the 1835 Treaty of Cession, three 
                    months after the Great Raft had been cleared. Tashar, who 
                    succeeded Dehahuit as head chief, said in support of the treaty: 
                    </span></p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>My Children: For what do you mourn? Are 
                      you not starving in the midst of this land? And do you not 
                      travel far from it in quest of food? The game we live on 
                      is going farther off, and the white man is coming near to 
                      us; and is not our condition getting worse daily? Then why 
                      lament for the loss of that which yields us nothing but 
                      misery? Let us be wise then, and get all we can for it, 
                      and not wait till the white man steals it away, little by 
                      little, and then gives us nothing.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">The Caddos got something for their land, but 
                    very little. They were handicapped by the absence of their 
                    regular interpreter, Larkin Edwards, during the negotiations. 
                    Further, their French Creole advisors were not allowed in 
                    the council. On July 1, 1835, the Caddos signed the treaty, 
                    which transferred about a million acres of land to the United 
                    States in exchange for $30,000 in goods and horses and $10,000 
                    per year in cash for the next five years. The Caddos apparently 
                    believed Timber Hill was in Louisiana, though it was actually 
                    then part of Mexico (now Texas), and people gradually began 
                    to leave the village that year. By 1842, it seems to have 
                    been completely abandoned.</p>
                  <p class="text">Ninety years after the agreement was signed, 
                    a very old Caddo woman named Mary Inkanish remembered that 
                    when she was a small child &quot;the whites raided the Indians, 
                    drove them from their villages and took a portion of their 
                    crops. After the treaty, part of the money was paid, but a 
                    part never was paid.&quot;</p>
                  <p class="text">Some Kadohadachos moved into Oklahoma, some 
                    to Mexico, and some to the Brazos River farther west in Texas, 
                    where a short-lived reservation was established for them in 
                    1854. Hostile Texas neighbors finally forced the removal of 
                    the last Caddos to a reservation on the Washita River in Oklahoma 
                    that had already been established for the Wichitas.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Many years later, anthropologist Dayna Bowker 
                    Lee recorded Lowell &quot;Wimpy&quot; Edmonds, a member of 
                    the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, singing some &quot;riding songs.&quot; 
                    Mr. Edmonds is a descendent of a Caddo woman and Larkin Edwards, 
                    the Caddos' white interpreter during the time of Timber Hill. 
                    He said the riding songs were sung while traveling on horseback, 
                    and he thought two of them related to his people's removal 
                    to Oklahoma, when they rode at night to avoid antagonistic 
                    Texas soldiers. In this song, a redbird warns them that daylight 
                    approaches:</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em><strong>Redbird [Yawdawsh] </strong></em>(<a href="images/RedBirdIntro.mp3" target="_blank" class="text">Listen</a> 
                      to a clip of Edmonds performing Redbird)</p>
                    <p class="text"><em>Redbird, redbird <br>
                      He got scared, he flew up out of the bush.<br>
                      It must be getting close to daylight.</em></p>
                    </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">Another song is about a near encounter with 
                    a Comanche (<a href="images/ComancheIntro.mp3" target="_blank" class="text">Listen</a> 
                    to a clip of the Comanche song):</p>
                  <blockquote>
                    <p class="text"><em>The Comanche was waving his hand.<br>
                      Go ahead, friend, go tell about this.<br>
                      He thought he would, he wanted to,<br>
                      He didn't see me, the Kadohadacho.</em></p>
