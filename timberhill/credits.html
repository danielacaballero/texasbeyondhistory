      <p class="text">Mark Parsons' ancestors had been in Texas since before the 
        Texas Revolution, but his parents cheated him of native Texan-hood by 
        stepping across the border into New Mexico, where he was born in Portales 
        in 1941. After brief stays in Oklahoma and Floyd County, Texas, his family 
        moved to Dickens County, where he entered a rural school in 1946 and moved 
        to Spur schools in 1949. He graduated from Spur High School in 1958 and 
        entered Texas Tech, transferring in 1960 to the University of Texas at 
        Austin, where he eventually took a B.A. and M.A. in anthropology. </p>
      <p class="text">Early reading stimulated Mark's interest in Native American 
        culture, and he collected artifacts from sites on and near the family 
        farm beginning when he was eight years old and through his school days. 
        By the time he was 13 he knew he wanted to be an archeologist, and at 
        19 he began his professional career under the tutelage of Ed Jelks at 
        the Texas Archeological Salvage Project at the University of Texas. Through 
        the years he has worked for Texas Memorial Museum, Texas Parks and Wildlife 
        Department, Southern Methodist University, Texas Historical Commission, 
        and several private archeological contracting firms. Special interests 
        include replication of &quot;primitive&quot; technologies and interpretation 
        of prehistoric artistic traditions. As Texas Historical Commission archeologist 
        for the Forest Trails Region, his most recent work focuses primarily on 
        the prehistoric and historic culture of the Caddo peoples of East Texas 
        and adjacent states.</p>
      <p class="text">A number of other individuals and organizations contributed 
        to the exhibit. Cecile Elkins Carter, Caddo historian and Cultural Liaison 
        for the Caddo Tribe of Oklahoma, reviewed the draft and provided numerous 
        helpful comments. Roland Pantermuehl of the THC provided graphics used 
        in the exhibit, and Bill Pierson, also of the THC, took many of the artifact 
        photographs. </p>
      <p class="text">The Oklahoma Arts Council provided the audiotape and book, 
        <em>Remaining Ourselves </em>(listed below) for the audioclips. Additional 
        recordings of Lowell Edmonds, Sr., were made by Dayna Bowker Lee for "Oral 
        Traditions of Caddo Removal and Relocation," presented at the 38th Caddo 
        Conference, Natchitoches, Louisiana. The Caddo songs were translated 
        by Edmonds and Dr. Alice Anderton.</p>
