                  <p class="text">Historians knew for a long time that Timber 
                    Hill was somewhere in the Marion County area near Caddo Lake, 
                    but exactly where was a mystery. In the 1990s Louisianan Claude 
                    McCrocklin set out to find it. </p>
                  <p class="text">McCrocklin is a former cattle buyer from Shreveport 
                    (and World War II pilot and POW) who after retirement took 
                    up archeology as a hobby. He quickly became something of a 
                    legend at ferreting out sites, and by the 1990s he and a crew 
                    of volunteers had located several historical Indian villages 
                    near the Red River. One was a Coushatta village whose members 
                    had interacted often with the Timber Hill people, according 
                    to historians Dan Flores and Jacques Bagur. The two historians 
                    urged McCrocklin to try to find the Kadohadacho village as 
                    well. McCrocklin, for his part, was also eager to locate it. 
                    &quot;To find one village and not the other,&quot; he wrote, 
                    &quot;would give an incomplete picture of the two principal 
                    tribes in the area.&quot; </p>
                  <p class="text">Early maps and historical records indicated 
                    that Timber Hill was probably in the vicinity of Jim's Bayou 
                    near the present Texas-Louisiana line. That information, combined 
                    with a passage in an account of the Freeman and Custis Expedition 
                    of 1806, gave McCrocklin a good clue about the site's whereabouts.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Freeman and Custis Expedition along the 
                    Red River recorded that Chief Dehahuit and 40 of his warriors 
                    left their village (Timber Hill) on the morning of June 30 
                    and arrived on the west side of the river opposite the Coushatta 
                    village about noon on the same day. Flores calculated that 
                    men on horseback traveling at a normal rate would cover approximately 
                    20 miles in one morning. McCrocklin added three miles to approximate 
                    the additional distance across the river to the Coushatta 
                    village. He used a pair of dividers to measure off 23 miles 
                    on a modern map and then drew an arc with that radius west 
                    from the Coushatta village. The place where the arc crossed 
                    Jim's Bayou gave McCrocklin a general place to look.</p>
                  <p class="text">McCrocklin and his helpers tramped through the 
                    pine forest there, but found nothing that could definitely 
                    be linked with Timber Hill.</p>
                  <p><span class="text">Meanwhile, Bagur continued scouring old 
                    records and was finally rewarded with the discovery of two 
                    extremely helpful maps. In the Louisiana State Land Office, 
                    he found an 1839 map that shows an &quot;Indian Village&quot; 
                    immediately south of Jim's Bayou. And in the Texas General 
                    Land Office, Bagur found a map produced in 1842 after the 
                    U.S.-Republic of Texas boundary survey in 1841, which shows 
                    an &quot;Old Indian Village&quot; at the same spot as the 
                    &quot;Indian Village&quot; on the Louisiana map. By 1842 Timber 
                    Hill would have been deserted, or nearly so, and thus termed 
                    an &quot;old&quot; Indian village. Both maps depicted the 
                    same small tributary of Jim's Bayou and a distinctive bend 
                    of the creek just below the village location. What's more, 
                    this &quot;Old Indian Village&quot; was in approximately the 
                    same area as the spot McCrocklin pinpointed with his arc.</span><br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="text">&quot;It was then just a matter of going 
                    and confirming the location of the Kadohadacho village,&quot; 
                    McCrocklin explained. &quot;Beginning at the loop in the creek 
                    and moving eastward, we checked favorable habitation locales 
                    until the village components were found.&quot; The artifacts 
                    he collected were of the right age to be from a village inhabited 
                    ca. 1800-1840. Most numerous were items of American or European 
                    origin&#151;cast iron and brass cookware, fragments of &quot;china&quot; 
                    and bottle glass, a spigot cock, pieces of knives and spoons, 
                    gun parts, &quot;square&quot; nails, and even an umbrella 
                    part. But the most conclusive evidence of a Native American 
                    presence at the site was a conical brass arrowpoint of a type 
                    commonly manufactured by historical tribes.</span></p>
                  <p class="text">Chances were excellent that Timber Hill had 
                    finally been located.</p>
                  <h3>Preparations for a Homecoming</h3>
                  <p class="text">After hearing of the discovery, officials from 
                    the city of Jefferson, about 15 miles from Timber Hill, got 
                    in touch with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and offered 
                    to sponsor testing to confirm that the site was indeed the 
                    Kadohadacho village. Excavations were scheduled for February 
                    1999. The city would pay the hard costs, the THC would provide 
                    salaries for the archeologists, and other labor would be supplied 
                    by volunteers. Due to the press of other duties, only six 
                    days of excavation were scheduled. That might be enough, however, 
                    to confirm archeologically, and once and for all, that the 
                    site was the long-sought settlement.</p>
                  <p class="text">Dr. James Bruseth, director of the THC's Archeology 
                    Division, was to be general supervisor of the project, and 
                    THC East Texas Regional Archeologist Mark Parsons would direct 
                    the field operations.</p>
                  <p class="text">A call for volunteers went out, drawing members 
                    of the THC's Texas Archeological Stewardship Network, a group 
                    of trained avocational archeologists, and other volunteers. 
                    A special invitation was extended to the Caddos in Oklahoma 
                    to join in the effort. Cecile Carter (Caddo historian), Richard 
                    Subia (tribal education officer), Abraham Pedro, and Derek 
                    Edmonds were among those who shoveled and troweled the soil 
                    side-by-side with the archeologists. Tribal Chair Vernon Hunter, 
                    Stacy Halfmoon, Bobby Gonzales, and Brien Haumpo had already 
                    visited the site soon after it had been discovered. All are 
                    probably descendants of the Timber Hill people, according 
                    to Cecile Carter. As far as anyone knows, it was the first 
                    time Caddos had returned to the last place in their ancestral 
                    land they had called home.</p><br>
