  <p class="text"><span class="red">Early Spanish and French explorers, soldiers, 
    and missionaries traveling through East Texas visited many Caddo villages 
    with dome-shaped houses. Fortunately for us today, they described what they 
    saw in their travel journals or diaries. One of the best accounts comes from 
    the diary of a young Frenchman, Henri Joutel, one of the survivors of the 
    failed Texas colony of the famous French explorer, La Salle. In the spring 
    of 1687, Henri stayed in several Caddo villages and wrote that the houses 
    looked "like large haystacks…except they are higher. They are covered with 
    grass from the ground to the top." Some of the larger houses were as tall 
    as 40-50 feet high. (In the old days before machinery, when hay was gathered 
    it was piled up into large dome-shaped stacks for drying&#151;few of us living 
    today have ever seen a haystack!)</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Building a grass house required lots of 
    hard and tedious work. But, according to the explorers, house building was 
    a happy and exciting time in Caddo communities. It was a special event during 
    which all the neighbors came together and shared the many tasks that had to 
    be done.</span> </p>
	 
  <div class="rel" style="float:left; width:200; height:263"><a href="../../printerkids/caddo/images/pine.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../printerkids/caddo/images/pine-sm.jpg" alt="pine trees" class="thumbimg" width="200" height="263"></a> 
    <div class="caption">Tall, young pine trees were cut to make the poles for 
      houses. Smaller sapling pines and tree branches were stripped of leaves 
      and woven between the tall poles. (Click on picture to make it larger.)</div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">First, the village leader, or <i>Caddi</i>, 
    chose the date for the event. Next he sent out his assistants (<i>Tammas</i>) 
    to appoint members of the community to perform different tasks. If a man was 
    given a small &quot;token&quot; stick, it meant he would have to cut down 
    and trim a tall, limber tree to make a pole for the house framework. According 
    to the Frenchman, Joutel, the poles were &quot;as big around as a man's thigh&quot;&#151;small 
    for a pine tree, but mighty heavy to drag around. </span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Other workers would cut young sapling trees 
    that could be bent and woven across the poles, almost like weaving a basket. 
    Meanwhile, women went to the nearest meadows to cut and gather bundles of 
    tall grass that would be used to cover the structure. Other workers cut long 
    strips of strong, flexible tree bark to use as thongs, or cord, to tie the 
    poles together.</span></p>

    <div class="caption">Workers carry in tall pine trees to be used as the main 
      poles, while others use their legs to bend thinner branches for the house 
      frame. (Click to make larger.)</div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">On the day before the house raising, the 
    village priest, or medicine man, drew a huge circle on the ground to show 
    where the house would be built. Around the circle, he marked the spots where 
    deep, evenly spaced holes would be dug to hold the tall poles. The <i>Tammas</i> 
    spent the night at the building place to get ready for the important day.</span></p>
 <div class="rel" style="float:left; width:175; height:250"><a href="../../printerkids/caddo/images/top.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../printerkids/caddo/images/top-sm.jpg" alt="top of the Caddo house" class="thumbimg" width="175" height="250"></a> 
    <div class="caption">Caddo workers climb to the top of a knobby pole, catch 
      the tops of the outer poles with bark thongs and lash them all together. 
      After the house was finished, the center pole was removed. (Click to make 
      larger.) </div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">At sunrise on the chosen day, the house-raising 
    began. Running to the circle carrying their poles, the village men stood them 
    upright in their assigned holes. Several men climbed up a special forked or 
    knobby pole set in the middle of the circle. The knobby pole was used as a 
    ladder and work platform so the men could draw together the tips of the limber 
    poles and tie them tightly together at the top. (This knobby pole was later 
    cut down after the house was finished.)</span></p>

    <div class="caption">Thin branches were woven 
      across poles to form the house framework.</div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Next they used strips of strong but flexible 
    tree bark (inner-bark, actually) to tie horizontal crossbars made of thin 
    branches across all the poles. The branches and poles formed the framework 
    or skeleton of the house.</span> </p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">When the framework was finished, the workers 
    covered the whole house from bottom to top with bundles of grass called &quot;thatch.&quot; 
    The bundles were lashed tightly against each other on the crossbars. The rows 
    of grass bundles overlapped like modern-day roofing shingles and helped keep 
    water out.</span></p>

	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">During the construction the<i> Tammas</i> 
    made sure everybody worked hard and did a good job. They carried switches, 
    which they used on slow or careless workers. This insured that the work was 
    done well and done quickly, and it was accepted by all (even the <i>Tammas</i>' 
    close relatives) with good humor. </span></p>

    <div class="caption">This house is nearly finished! Can you guess what's missing 
      from the top?</div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">By midday, the house was finished (except 
    for inside work) and was blessed by the priest. A special &quot;hat&quot; 
    or animal-like figure made of grass was placed on the top of the house to 
    mark the completion of the house and make it stand out from other houses in 
    the village.</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Now it was time for the villagers to celebrate 
    and enjoy a feast of corn, pumpkin, beans, sunflower seeds, walnuts, and venison 
    (deer meat) prepared by the families who were to live in the new house. When 
    the feast was over, the villagers returned to their own homes and their normal 
    day-to-day routines. It had been a productive day for all.</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">In the eyes of the French and Spanish explorers, 
    the Caddo were different in many ways. But they shared similar values about 
    home, family, leadership, and civic duties. These qualities inspired respect 
    and made them seem more &quot;civilized&quot; than many of the other tribes 
    the explorers encountered on their travels. </span></p>
