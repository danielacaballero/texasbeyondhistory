	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">About 20 years ago the Texas Parks and Wildlife 
    Department decided to build a Caddo-style grass house at Caddoan Mounds State 
    Park in East Texas. They wanted to give park visitors a better idea of what 
    ancient village life was like. Using the early explorers' accounts as a guide, 
    a small group of archeologists and volunteers built a Caddo-style &quot;grass&quot; 
    house using traditional methods and materials. They quickly learned that it 
    was not easy work.</span> </p>
	 <div class="rel" style="float:left; width:300; height:234"><a href="../../printerkids/caddo/images/thatchpeople.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../printerkids/caddo/images/thatchpeople-sm.jpg" alt="thatch people" class="thumbimg" width="300" height="234"></a> 
    <div class="caption">They gathered bundles of river cane to use as thatch 
      (roofing material). The Caddo used bunches of tall grass to thach their 
      houses, but this kind of grass no longer grows abundantly in the area. (Click 
      to make larger.)</div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">They had to find the right building materials, 
    which was not easy. Most of the surrounding forest had been cut down to make 
    way for modern farms. So, instead of tall native grass, they had to use river 
    cane. They also had to learn how to make stone and wooden tools and then use 
    them.</span> </p>
	<div class="rel" style="float:right; width:200; height:211"><a href="../../printerkids/caddo/images/leather.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../printerkids/caddo/images/leather-sm.jpg" alt="leather strips" class="thumbimg" width="200" height="211"></a> 
    <div class="caption">Yards and yards of leather strips were used to lash together 
      the pole framework for the house. </div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">They had to find a way to join the pieces 
    of the house together. For this, they used store-bought strips of leather 
    to tie the poles together. This turned out to be a mistake, as leather rots 
    pretty quickly in a humid environment, plus mice and rats like to chew leather. 
    Ancient Caddo builders, who knew better, used strips of strong tree bark (the 
    inner, flexible part), which lasted longer.</span></p>

    <div class="caption">The workers used their legs and feet to try to bend some 
      of the poles.</div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="blue">Unlike the Caddo, who worked together and 
    could build a house in a single day, the state park workers took several weeks 
    to build their house. Sometimes they had to use modern tools and equipment 
    rather than the old-style tools and methods. But, in the end, they succeeded 
    in building a fairly sturdy grass house that closely resembled the houses 
    described by the explorers.</span></p>

    <div class="caption">Hurricane winds blowing in from the Texas coast blasted 
      the house, causing it to twist and slump. Park rangers were able to straighten 
      it up a bit, and it stood for several more years. But it was never the same 
      and, as it rotted, they realized it would have to be taken down before someone 
      got hurt.</div>
	</div>
  <p class="text"> <span class="red">The "modern" grass house stood tall and sturdy 
    for years at the park. But the story did not end there. One day a huge storm 
    blew onshore from the Gulf of Mexico. The powerful winds twisted the house, 
    and it began to lean. It looked kind of like the Leaning Tower of Pisa!</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Gradually the grass house began to fall apart 
    and the park rangers decided it was not safe for visitors to enter. But instead 
    of just tearing it down, they let archeologists conduct an experiment, based 
    on a Caddo tradition involving fire.</span></p>

	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">The ancient Caddo sometimes destroyed the 
    houses of their leaders by burning&#151;sometimes because the house was failing 
    apart and sometimes because the leader had died. Sometimes the Caddo buried 
    departed family members beneath their own house before burning it down to 
    honor the person. </span> </p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Lacking a willing human volunteer to be buried 
    in the &quot;modern&quot; Caddo house, an alternative was found. Sadly, a 
    dog named Ranger had just been killed by a car. Ranger's owner decided that 
    a &quot;state burial&quot; would be quite an honor for his old four-legged 
    friend. So Ranger was buried beneath the floor of the leaning grass house 
    along with special things like beads and fancy pottery that were like those 
    the ancient Caddo buried with their dead. They also placed straw mats, food 
    (like pots full of dried corn and beans), and other items near the dog's grave 
    in the leaning house.</span></p>

	</div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">The archeologists had a reason for going 
    to all that trouble. They wanted to study the house and the burial both before 
    and after it burned. Then they could compare what they saw with the ancient 
    Caddo house sites they had excavated. This is called &quot;experimental archeology.&quot;</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">When everything was ready, a large group 
    of archeologists, schoolkids, Caddo and Adai Indians, and local visitors (including 
    Ranger's owner) gathered to burn down the house. A leader of the Adai Indians 
    from nearby Louisiana blessed the ceremony by burning cedar and letting the 
    smoke, which the Caddo and many other groups consider sacred, &quot;bathe&quot; 
    the participants.</span></p>

  <p class="text"><span class="red">Finally the house was set afire. At first 
    there was mostly smoke and not much fire, but suddenly the dried thatch caught 
    fire. Within seconds the entire house was ablaze. The fire lasted only a few 
    minutes before the tremendous heat burned up all the posts and the flaming 
    house collapsed. </span></p>

  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">By the next year grass had grown over the 
    burned house and hidden its story. Some day in the future, 10 or 20 years 
    from now, a new group of archeologists will dig up the remains of the experimental 
    grass house and compare what they find in the ground to the pictures you see 
    here. In this way the archeological experiment will continue.</span></p>
