  <p class="text"><span class="red">In ancient times, the Caddo were &quot;lords&quot; 
    of the East Texas woodlands and far beyond. Their villages and farms stretched 
    for miles along the wide Red River, the Neches, and the Sabine. The Caddo 
    people were farmers, hunters, builders, artists, traders, warriors, dancers, 
    and priests. They were fathers, and mothers, sisters, and brothers.</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Today, the Caddo have many of the same jobs, 
    talents, and skills, but they have adapted these to the modern, 21st-century 
    world.</span></p>

  </div>
  <p class="text"><span class="red">There are still Caddo farmers, but today they 
    plow their fields with tractors rather than poke the ground with wooden digging 
    sticks. There are still Caddo warriors, but they wear the uniform of a policeman 
    or U.S. soldier rather than the face paint and feather robe of the warriors 
    hundreds of years ago. There are still Caddo builders, but they use table 
    saws and nail guns rather than stone tools and leather ropes to construct 
    their homes.</span> </p>
	
  <p class="text"><span class="red">Today the Caddo are much like any other residents 
    of the United States, except for an important difference. The heritage of 
    the Caddo in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma goes back more than 
    1000 years! The Caddo people are proud of their long heritage and preserve 
    as much of it as they can, just as they have always done, by passing traditional 
    knowledge from tribal elders down to the younger generations.</span> </p>

    their ancient homeland in the early nineteenth century (about 150 years ago), 
    they tried to preserve their memories. In Indian Territory, today's Oklahoma, 
    they kept their traditions alive by remembering Caddo stories, songs, dances, 
    and music, many in the native Caddo language. Today, the Caddo continue to 
    honor their ancestors by making sure that Caddo traditions are not forgotten. 
    Passed on through many generations, these traditions run deep in the Caddo 
    tribe.</span></p>

    gather for festivals and celebrations on important occasions. The women and 
    young girls wear bright costumes with colorful ribbons. Stepping in time to 
    the rhythm of the Caddo drummers, they dance the traditional dances taught 
    to them by their mothers, aunts, and grandmothers. Some dances, like the Turkey 
    Dance, are so old that no one can still remember the meaning of all the parts 
    and songs of the dance.</span></p>
