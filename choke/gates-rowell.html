          <p>Located just a short distance northeast of  Possum Hollow was another major terrace camping area, known 
            as the Gates-Rowell site (41 LK 31/32).  (See<a href="images/LK201-Highley-1986-Fig1.html" target="_blank"> map  of area</a>.) Whereas Possum Hollow was situated along a slough, the Gates-Rowell site was along the main, active channel of the Frio River.  As a consequence, the deposits were 
            deeper (8- to 10 feet), with the earliest dated evidence of human activity going back at least 5300 
            years. Robert F. Scott analyzed and reported the Gates-Rowell site. </p>
          <p>Layered in the sediments of the  site were both cooking hearths and rock-lined roasting 
            ovens.  Among some of the earliest human remains left on the site were hearth areas where mussels and 
            land snails were cooked, along with freshwater drum (gaspergou) and other fish from the river.  A few 
            bones of deer and rabbit recovered in the excavations offer scant evidence of additional animals hunted 
            or caught for food by the people living in the camp.  Certainly there were many other elements to the 
            diet of the people who camped here, especially plant foods, but the evidence has not survived.</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="480" valign="top">
	<p>The Gates-Rowell site offered archeologists an exceptional opportunity for studying the activities of 
            prehistoric people because of the past frequency with which the Frio River flooded and covered ancient 
            camp site debris with sediment.  These layers of sediment laid down between camping episodes served to "
            freeze" evidence of past human activity in place, so to speak.  An excellent example of such preservation 
            is shown in this feature, consisting of some chert cobbles and flakes that had been left behind  by a 
            prehistoric flintknapper in the process of making some stone tools.  Right next to the chert tool-making 
            debris was a cluster of mussel shells.  This feature was  covered by flood sediment shortly after 
            the flintknapper sat making  tools and dining on a meal of mussels. </p>
          <p>At many open prehistoric camp sites, such debris would have been disturbed and scattered before being 
            buried, and thus would not provide as clear a "snapshot" of ancient life as was provided at 
            Gates-Rowell. </p>
          <p>Open camp fires, dating back to the Middle Archaic period (as much as 5,000 years ago) were places 
            where people cooked some of the foods that sustained them.  One such example from the Gates-Rowell site 
            was marked by fired clay and small amounts of charcoal in the midst of numerous mussel shells and the 
            shells of big land snails (referred to by archeologists using the scientific name Rabdotus).  The mussels 
            were probably gathered from shallow water in the channel of the Frio River.  The gastropod land snails, 
            common over all of the South Texas Plains, can be easily collected on land.  Both the mussels and snails, being easy 
            to gather, would be good food resources for children to go out and collect as their contribution to family 
            meals back in camp.  To prepare mussels and snails for eating, it was necessary only to build a small 
            ground fire and place the mussels and snails, still in their shells, on the coals and embers for just a few minutes.  Once 
            cooked, the snail or mussel was easily removed from the shell. </p>
          <p>These hearths usually consisted of a shallow pit dug into the ground.  A wood fire was built in the pit 
            and then a layer of river cobbles was placed on top of the fire to absorb the heat.  Food products, such 
            as fish, rabbits, or venison could then be cooked on top of the rocks, using them like a griddle.  
            Charcoal (carbonized wood) found in such features was very useful for two reasons.  First, the carbon 
            could be submitted for radiocarbon dates, allowing a determination of how long ago people 
            created the feature and were living on the site.  Secondly, in the hands of an expert, the species of wood 
            burned to form the charcoal can sometimes be determined.  Carbon samples from hearths at the Gates-Rowell 
            site were identified as being oak and ash by Dr. Phil Dering of Texas A&M University.  Thus, archeologists 
            knew not only when the hearths were built, but what woods were used as fuel.</p>
          <p>Artifacts recovered during excavations at the  site are typical of Archaic sites in the region.  Chipped stone dart points, gouges, and bifacial chipped stone knife blades are 
            included in the assemblage.  Also recovered were flakes and chips of chert, much of them simply being 
            waste products from the manufacture of stone tools, known in flintknapping jargon as "debitage."  Some of 
            these flakes and chips, however, were used very effectively in a variety of cutting and scraping chores 
            that occurred every day in the camps. </p>
          <p>Other debris commonly recovered in excavations includes burned- and fire-fractured rock, mussel shells, 
            and snail shells.  Though small numbers of animal bones were recovered, the preservation of bone was 
            generally very poor.  One type of fish bone, known as an "otolith," did survive at the Gates-Rowell site, 
            probably because such bones, being particularly thick and shaped like lima beans, were more durable than 
            the thin bones typical of many animals.  It is probable that the archeological deposits  
            preserved only a fraction of the bones of animals that were brought to the site to eat.  No direct 
            evidence of the plant foods the people used was recovered, but such food must have been a big contributor 
            to the diet of the prehistoric people at Gates-Rowell.</p>
