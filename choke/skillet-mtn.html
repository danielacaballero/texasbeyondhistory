<h2>Skillet Mountain # 4 (41MC222) </h2>


<table width="780" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="480">
          
          <p>At the far west end of Choke Canyon Lake, not far from Tilden, Texas, is a picturesque mesa known as 
            Skillet Mountain.  The Frio River runs below the north end of the mesa.  This area of the Frio River 
            valley is only flooded at times when Choke Canyon Lake is at maximum flood stage. </p>
          <p>While archeologists were working at Choke Canyon, the owner of the ranch encompassing Skillet Mountain 
            decided to clear some brush.  This was accomplished using a bulldozer pulling a "drag" made of iron anchor 
            chain and train rails.  In the process of clearing the brush, the bulldozer exposed an important Late 
            Prehistoric site which was given the name "Skillet Mountain #4."  This site is a classic example of a Late 
            Prehistoric buffalo hunters' encampment. (As the site's full name implies, several other archeological sites were recorded around Skillet Mountain, but #4 was the only one whose name lives on,  often  in  just  the shortened form,  Skillet Mountain.)</p>
          <p>The site was situated on the higher ground inside an oxbow loop of an abandoned channel of the Frio River.  
            Since the hunters were camping at the site comparatively recently (somewhere between A.D. 1250 and 1500), 
            the camping debris was not as deeply buried as at older terrace sites such as Possum Hollow and Gates-Rowell.  In fact, the remains were very shallowly buried, which is why they became partially exposed by 
            the bulldozer activity.  Yet, due to river flooding, the camp was rather quickly covered by sediment and 
            the camping remains were sealed in place very well.  Possibly because of soil conditions, or because the 
            remains were not very old, there was very good bone preservation at Skillet Mountain #4. The remains included  very 
            obvious large bones from buffalo as well as the smaller bones of  other animals.  Excavations at this camp 
            yielded two hallmarks of the Late Prehistoric Period:  arrow points and plainware pottery.</p>
          <p>Though shallow - only about 40 cm or 15 inches deep - the Skillet Mountain archeological deposits 
            were stratified.  The layering of the Late Prehistoric debris in this deposit indicates that there was 
            more than one episode of camping at the site.  In between camping episodes, the river overflowed its banks and 
            left sediments that separated  the camping trash left by each group who used the site.  These various 
            encampments might have occurred over less than 100 years, but certainly over no more than 400 years.  By 
            the standards of Choke Canyon prehistory, this was a very short period of time.</p>
          <p>Overall, this Skillet Mountain camp was about 48 meters (about 145 feet) in length and 12 meters (about 36 feet) 
            in width.  Forty-seven square meters of the site were excavated by archeologists.  This excavation 
            revealed fascinating patterns of camping activity by the Late Prehistoric people who used the site.  
            Eight features were defined, which were made up of various combinations of animal bone, sandstone 
            hearthstones, mussel and snail shells, chipped stone and ground stone tools, and chert debitage.</p>
          <p>Analysis of the animal bones, ground stone tools, and mussel- and snail shell collected at Skillet 
            Mountain #4 shows that these Late Prehistoric people were living off of many of the same natural foods 
            that had traditionally supported Archaic hunter-gatherers for thousands of years.  The good 
            preservation of animal bones gives a much fuller picture of the variety of animals that these people 
            hunted, netted, trapped, and caught.  Buffalo was prominent.  The big bones of these animals predominated 
            in the Skillet Mountain collection.  In addition to buffalo,  there were also bones of deer, 
            javelina, coyote or dog, bobcat, alligator, rattlesnake, rabbit, rat, turtle, lizard, frog, catfish, gar, 
            and other fish.  Very likely this variety was also typical of Archaic people in the region, too, but the bones 
            of these animals haven't survived as well in  older sites.  Other parallels with the Archaic include 
            metates and manos, suggesting processing of seeds, beans, and nuts.  Late Prehistoric people also relied 
            on river mussels and land snails in the same way as did Archaic people.</p></td>

    <table width="780" border="0">
      <tr>
        <td width="480" valign="top"><p>For a south Texas site, Skillet Mountain #4 was also remarkable for the quantity and size of pottery 
            fragments it yielded.  These Late Prehistoric people were making and using pottery.  The incorporation of 
            pottery into the Late Prehistoric technology gave the people new ways to cook and store foods.  Clay pots 
            could be placed directly on a fire to cook food. </p>
          <p>The arrow points recovered at Skillet Mountain #4 are categorized as belonging to the Scallorn and 
            Edwards types, both of which have expanding stems.  These types indicate that the site represents the 
            earlier stages of the Late Prehistoric Period.  During the waning years of the Late Prehistoric, a 
            distinctive arrow point with a contracting stem, known as the Perdiz type, came into use.  None of this 
            type of arrow point were found at Skillet Mountain.</p>
          <p>Another interesting aspect of the findings at Skillet Mountain #4 involves the condition of many of the 
            buffalo bones.  Many of these had been broken into small slivers and were found in the 
            midst of the hearth features.  From studies of buffalo hunters elsewhere in North 
            America, it is known that a common practice  was to crush up the buffalo bone and then boil the 
            pieces  to extract every ounce of fat from them that they possibly could.  It is likely that this 
            was happening at Skillet Mountain and is a good indication of how important fat was in the diet of 
            prehistoric people. Fat is one of the hardest things for most hunter-gatherers to find.  In the South Texas Plains the large herbivores (bison, deer, and antelope) were prime sources as were certain plant foods, especially pecans.</p>
          <p>The body of information recovered from Skillet Mountain provides a useful example of an archeological 
            assemblage to be expected of an early Late Prehistoric encampment at Choke Canyon and more generally 
            throughout southern Texas. </p>
