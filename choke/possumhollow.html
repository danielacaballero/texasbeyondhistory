<h2>Possum Hollow Site (41LK201)</h2>
<table width="780" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="480" valign="top">
	<p>The Possum Hollow site is a good example of what archeologists call an "open terrace site."  There are 
            thousands of such sites along creeks and rivers in Texas.  Back in prehistoric times, such locations were 
            prime places for hunter-gatherers to camp.  There was shade, soft ground, firewood, nearby water, and many 
            different food resources within a convenient distance.  This site, now covered by the waters of Choke 
            Canyon Reservoir, was located on the south bank of an abandoned channel of the Frio River, forming a 
            slough where floodwater and rainwater collected in a long "oxbow" lake.  When the river left its banks in 
            a flood, water would flow through the slough,  and when the flood receded, water would be caught in the 
            slowly shrinking body of water.  Fish would also be trapped and, as long as the water lasted, they, along with mussels, turtles, 
            alligators, and other aquatic species, would be available as food to prehistoric hunter-gatherers.</p>
          <p>The archeological record indicates that Possum Hollow was repeatedly occupied by prehistoric people 
            over thousands of years, probably in brief camping episodes, with each episode lasting a couple of  days 
            or weeks.  Concurrent with periodic use of the site through time, the river would flood and deposit thin 
            layers of sediment over debris left by the campers.  The terrace gradually built up as time went by&#8212;six 
            to eight feet of sediment built up over several thousand years&#8212;sandwiching stone tools, animal bones, mussel shells, 
            charcoal, and hearth features in the layers. </p>
          <p>Possum Hollow site proved to be particularly informative because its  deposits were better 
		  preserved than those of most Choke Canyon sites. C. Lynn Highley's 1986 report on  the site details its archeology.</p>
          <p>Deeply buried Middle and Late Archaic hearths 
            and baking pits had  concentrations of burned rocks, ash, baked clay, animal bone fragments,  
            lots of charcoal, and in one case carbonized oak logs. Several radiocarbon assays showed the 
            Archaic deposits spanned at least 600-1300 B.C. Many animal bones were recovered from both the 
            Archaic and Late Prehistoric deposits, revealing that the hunter-gatherers of the area harvested 
            a very impressive array of large and small mammals, reptiles, fish, invertebrates, and birds. 
            Two small excavation blocks measuring 3-x-3 and 3-x-4 meters targeted the Middle and Late 
            Archaic deposits. These blocks were excavated by hand to 2-2.5 meters below the surface (6.5-8 
            feet).  The 1981 UTSA field school excavated a larger block of 6-x-6 meters  adjacent to the 
            slough,  where  the  shallowly buried  Late Prehistoric deposit was concentrated. </p>

          <p>The Late Prehistoric component was a late Toyah horizon campsite dated by two radiocarbon 
		  assays to about A.D.1550, several hundred years after Toyah sites, such as Hinojosa, first 
		  appeared in the South Texas Plains.  Possum Hollow  yielded a wealth of Late Prehistoric 
		  artifacts including the classic Toyah chipped-stone tool kit (Perdiz, beveled knives, end 
		  scrapers, and flake drills) as well as tools made of bone and  ground stone, bone and shell 
		  ornaments, and  pottery. Over 1500 sherds of bone-tempered pottery were recovered, making the 
		  Possum Hollow  sample  one of the largest ceramic assemblages documented at any prehistoric site 
		  in the region. The pottery fragments represent approximately 20 vessels, several of which were 
		  later partially reconstructed. </p>
          <p>The faunal assemblage was extremely well preserved in the Toyah deposit and well preserved in 
		  all but the deepest Archaic deposits. Both Late Prehistoric and Archaic samples showed that a 
		  very broad range of animals were exploited, over 30 species, from large mammals to rodents, 
		  carnivores (bobcat, coyote, and raccoons), catfish, turkey, and turtles. Except for a single 
		  tooth found in the Archaic deposits, bison was only found in the Toyah deposit, where many 
		  bison bones were present. The faunal analysis, however, showed that deer was the main prey 
		  species even in late times. The second runner in the most-frequently-harvested animal category 
		  was the rabbit, both cottontail and jack rabbits. Ten species of rodents were identified. The 
		  faunal evidence also showed that spring was the main occupation period, but the site was 
		  occupied in other seasons as well.</p>
          <p>All in all, the Possum Hollow site was one of the most informative sites studied at Choke 
		  Canyon. In hindsight, much more could have been learned if funding and time had allowed truly 
		  large scale excavations, but that is true of many archeological sites. </p>
