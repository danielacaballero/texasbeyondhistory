      <h2>Harmony Hill (also known as Nip ‘n’ Tuck)</h2>
      <p>
		  Harmony Hill was founded later but endured longer than Camden. It was advantageously positioned near several transportation corridors including Trammel’s Trace, the roads to Grand Bluff, Shreveport, and Marshall, and the Old Wire Road, a stagecoach line that traversed northeast-southwest through Rusk County. The community of Harmony Hill served as a trade and social center for plantations along Martin Creek and its several tributaries. Kentucky-born John William Kuykendall, farmer and slaveowner, platted the community, first known as Nip ‘n’ Tuck. 
		</p>
	  <p>
		  The small town bustled with development in the mid-nineteenth century. Kuykendall donated the initial 2 acres of land for the Harmony Hill Cemetery in 1852 and first sold town lots in 1855. The post office opened in 1854 and operated until 1905. Primitive Baptists built the first church, a one-room log building, that they shared with other denominations. Businessmen included merchants, a druggist, and a blacksmith. The community had a one-teacher school, furniture factory, and Masonic lodge. The two-story wood-frame lodge hosted school, court, church services for various congregations, and community activities on its first floor. Henderson Street, the town’s main east-west thoroughfare, doubled as a racetrack for entertainment on Saturday evenings. By 1860, the town had five merchants, four mechanics, and three clerks, plus a grocer, hatter, blacksmith, trader, wagoner, hotel keeper, doctor, miller, and gunsmith. After the Civil War, Allen Vince Hendrick, the Hendricks’ oldest surviving son, and William M. Gladney went into the mercantile business together. Homer J. Harris Sr., one of the Hendricks’ future sons-in-law, purchased a local mercantile business in the late 1870s and was postmaster in 1879.

			Harmony Hill declined after 1882, when the Longview and Sabine Valley Railroad bypassed the town and instead went through Easton (formerly Camden), Tatum, and Carthage. Nevertheless, as late as 1891, Harmony Hill had a population of about 100 and four cotton gins, three gristmills, three churches, two general stores, and a school, saloon, and furniture store. Most of these enterprises and institutions remained in place in 1890. However, the post office closed in 1905 and mail was diverted to Tatum. A 1906 tornado destroyed much of what remained of the town.
