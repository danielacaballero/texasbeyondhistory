      <h2>Sabine River</h2>
      <p>The Sabine River is the northern boundary of Rusk County. It flows southeast, eventually forming a portion of the Texas-Louisiana border, after which it joins the Neches River and flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The river would have served as a transportation corridor via small boats at times, but sustained use for shipping cargoes such as cotton was not practical because the water level often dropped too low. During floods the swollen Sabine River impeded travelers, but for most of the year, the river did not prevent travel along roads that traversed east Texas. Places along the river where the water was shallow, such as the Trammelâ€™s Trace crossing, served as fords where pedestrians, horseback riders, and animal-drawn wagons could cross.  Ferries, like those upstream at Camden and downstream at Grand Bluff, could handle traffic even when the river level was high. People living at the Hendrick and Ware plantations could make an easy day trip to the Sabine River to picnic or fish along its banks.</p>
