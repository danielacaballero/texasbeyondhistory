      <h2>Ramsdale's Ferry (also known as Trammel's Trace Crossing)</h2>
      <p>The 1863 map labels the Ramsdale’s Ferry at the Sabine River on the road south from Marshall as “wagon ford,” and it is likely a ferry no longer operated there in 1863 despite the crossing’s name. This was also the Trammel’s Trace Crossing. Decades earlier, John F. Ramsdale owned land on the north side of the river by 1834 and established a ferry, which relatives Francis Ramsdale and George Ramsdale subsequently took over. The Ramsdales were gone by 1841. With or without a ferry, this crossing was an important cultural landscape feature, a place through which people, livestock, wagons, and commerce traveled. </p>
		<p>Even today, a resistant seam of hard coal that forms the bottom of the river channel makes this a good place to ford the river when water levels are low. However, when the river ran deep this crossing would have been impassable, necessitating detours upstream or downstream. The closest alternative was Walling’s Ferry at the town of Camden.</p>
