      <h2>Trammel's Trace</h2>
      <p>
			Trammel’s Trace, labeled as the “Road to Marshall” on the 1863 map, was a transportation route that played an especially prominent role in the early Euro-American settlement of east Texas. Native Americans had used a series of connected trails following this route for hundreds of years. In July 1542,  remnants of the Hernando de Soto expedition trekked along this trail during their brief foray through east Texas. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, notorious Arkansas smuggler, horse racer, and tavern operator Nicholas Trammel established the trace, which became the main route for travelers and settlers to enter east Texas from the north. Trammel’s Trace started on the Red River at Fulton, Arkansas, where it connected with the Southwest Trail to St. Louis and other places to the east and north. Extending south to Nacogdoches and the road to San Antonio, Trammel’s Trace was the route many Upper South immigrants used when they first came to Texas. By the time the Hendricks and Wares established their plantations, the trace was still an important route but not the only one. Trammel’s Trace bisected the Hendrick plantation where it was still visible on the landscape in the twenty-first century as a shallow depression or swale about 65 feet wide.
