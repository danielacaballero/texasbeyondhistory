      <h2>Swamp Bottom and Hendricks Lake</h2>
      <p>
		  This area is a mostly flat floodplain with occasional low rises and numerous sloughs and low-lying areas with standing water. Often wet and burdened with unproductive clayey soils, the bottomlands were unattractive for permanent settlement. Many local residents and travelers probably camped in the vicinity overnight to fish in the river and sloughs or wait for the water level to drop before they could cross.   
		</p>
        <p>The largest water feature in Swamp Bottom is Hendricks Lake, though it is denoted on the 1863 map as Flanagan’s Lake. This linear body of water, about 0.6 miles long, 150–300 feet wide, and 12–40 feet deep, is an old river channel that was cut off when the Sabine River changed its course thousands of years ago. This oxbow lake is a permanent feature on the landscape fed by numerous springs, Black Slough, and flood waters from the Sabine River and Cherokee Bayou. It likely was a favored fishing spot for plantation occupants, and the likely source for snapping turtle, alligator, catfish, gar, and duck, the bones of which archeologists found. The lake also  has long been associated with stories that the pirate Jean Lafitte dumped silver stolen from the Spanish there in 1816. These legends spawned numerous ambitious treasure-hunting attempts, reportedly starting in the 1880s and continuing through at least the 1960s. None were successful, however. </p>
