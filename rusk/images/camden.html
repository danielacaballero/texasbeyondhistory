      <h2>Camden (also known as Walling’s Ferry and Easton)</h2>
      <p>The Walling’s Ferry crossing of the Sabine River, later known as Camden and most recently as Easton, was the earliest of two small communities that developed in the area. Commercial interests in Camden peaked during the antebellum period, when the community served the commercial and social necessities of the plantations along Cherokee Bayou and Lee and Martin Creeks.</p>
	  <p>By 1847, the community had a post office, a public square, and a docking facility at the ferry location. By 1850, a few small-scale entrepreneurs used hand, horse, or steam power to manufacture wares from raw materials, like clay, wood, animal hides, wool, and various metals. South Carolinian James Prothro ran a slave market in Camden, where African Americans were stripped to the waist and exhibited on a high scaffold to potential buyers. Prothro also jointly owned a pottery that produced jugs and other earthenware using clay from Chalk Hill, a local source. In 1854, the Red River Telegraph Company installed a line that coordinated shipments to and from Camden with ports at Shreveport, Galveston, and New Orleans. By 1860, Camden’s commercial and manufacturing enterprises included shops, a grocery, a blacksmith, an iron foundry, a tar kiln, saloons, shoemakers, mechanics, teachers, doctors, an attorney, a sportsman, and, of course, the ferry. There was also a Presbyterian church and a cemetery. Community activities included religious, social, and political gatherings. </p>

		<p>The citizens of Camden were politically active. Sam Houston crossed the river there in December 1832 and later attended local Democratic rallies and lectured at the Masonic lodge. In 1856, Camden Democrats hosted a barbecue in support of presidential candidate James Buchanan. At the outset of the Civil War, the ferry crossing at Camden was an intended Confederate shipping depot, but severe drought foiled this plan, rendering this portion of the river impassable. </p>
		
		<p>The community dissipated in the early 1860s, but the post office was not discontinued until 1872. In 1885, the Texas, Sabine Valley and Northwestern Railroad built a track through the area. The small town subsequently reemerged as the community of Easton. Easton, a sawmill town which also had a coffin factory and other manufacturing businesses, was a mostly African American community, and continues to be in the twenty-first century.</p>
