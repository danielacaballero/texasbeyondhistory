      <h2>Hendrick Plantation</h2>
      <p>
		  The main body of the Hendrick plantation encompassed 1,913.5 acres as of 1863, which excludes two additional parcels patriarch Seaborn Jones Hendrick Sr. owned that were not contiguous with the main plantation lands. This medium-sized plantation was established by 1851, and perhaps as early as 1848, soon after the Hendrick family, and possibly a few African Americans they enslaved, settled in Rusk County. Plantation occupants grew to include as many as 23 enslaved African Americans, the Hendrick patriarch and matriarch and their nine children, and, at some intervals, Hendrick Sr.’s widowed mother, a young male schoolteacher, and another farmer.  </p>
	  <p>
		  The Hendricks were probably drawn to this land since it was close to established roads that led to markets. The sandy soils and adequate rainfall supported agricultural pursuits. Cotton and corn were the main crops on the plantation, with other grains, vegetables, and fruits as secondary crops. The enslaved had cleared some woodlands for cultivation, but most of the land remained unimproved and free-ranging cows and hogs grazed upon the flora. At first economically successful, the plantation suffered losses and Hendrick Sr. declared bankruptcy after the Civil War ended. The plantation continued to operate, at least until Hendrick Sr.’s 1882 death, albeit without slave labor. 
		</p>
	  <p>
		  An important community gathering place on the Hendrick plantation was the schoolhouse that Hendrick Sr. established. One account states that the school was a log building measuring 20 feet on a side with a hard clay floor and a large fireplace. Up to 20 children attended the school for four months each year. Schoolteachers included Obediah Dodson, the last husband of Hendrick Sr.’s mother, Levi Hill Ware, and William Metcalf, who lived with the Hendricks in 1860.
