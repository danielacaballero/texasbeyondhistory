      <p>
		  Before and after the Civil War, farmers traveled to the Rusk County seat at Henderson to pay taxes and conduct real estate and commercial transactions. Approximately 20 miles southwest of the Hendrick and Ware plantations, the county seat boasted seven blacksmith shops, six wagon or carriage shops, three gristmills, two saddleries, two tin shops, two tailors, two printer/publishers, a jug factory, cabinet shop, brickyard, tannery, distillery, sawmill, and shoe shop. In 1860, the widow of Levi Hill Ware, Elizabeth Ware Flanagan, moved to Henderson with her second husband, James Winwright Flanagan. Several of the Hendrick's adult children lived and worked in Henderson as well.

                    <figcaption>Henderson, Texas, date unknown. This photograph was undoubtedly taken decades after the Hendrick and Ware plantations ceased to operate (based on the presence of automobiles), yet the image captures the hub-bub of horse-drawn buggies and wagons, which carried people to the county seat to attend to personal or business needs. Photograph by the Texas Historical Commission [Historic Property, Photograph 3052-08], accessed through University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History.</figcaption>
