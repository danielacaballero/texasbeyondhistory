					<p>
						Archeologist <b>Ross C. Fields</b>, Historian <b>Amy E. Dase</b> and TBH Assistant Editor <b>Emily McCuistion</b> wrote the Rusk County Plantation exhibit. Fields and Dase, who were involved in the Hendrick and Ware plantation project since its inception, are employed by Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc. (CMEC), and were formerly employed by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI). CMEC, a small Austin-based environmental and cultural resources consulting firm, purchased PAI in early 2020. When the present exhibit was developed in mid-2021, the combined CMEC-PAI cultural resources program had nearly 30 full-time archeologists and historians who have completed approximately 3,500 cultural resources studies, the majority in Texas. </p>
				
					<p>
						Emily McCuistion and TBH Editor <b>Steve Black</b> designed and developed the exhibit for the web, with assistance from Liberal Arts Instructional Technology Services (LAITS) at UT-Austin and <b>Stacy Vlasits</b>. <b>Sandy Hannum</b>, of CMEC and previously PAI, created the regional and site maps, with the exception of the interactive Cultural Landscape map designed by Emily McCuistion and <b>Cristina Nunez</b> of LAITS. <b>Maria Franklin</b>, Department of Anthropology at University of Texas at Austin, reviewed the exhibit and provided helpful comments. </p>
					
				  <p>
						<b>North American Coal Corporation–Sabine Mine</b> sponsored and funded the project, with Josh McAfee, Steve Billingslea, and Eric Anderson overseeing the project for the mine. The Hendrick and Ware Plantations TBH exhibit is the second major public archeological exhibit sponsored by Sabine Mine. The first, <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/pine/index.html" target="_blank">Pine Tree Mound</a>, documents a unique Caddo site that has revolutionized our understanding of the ceremonial, political, and economic landscape of northeast Texas in the fourteenth–eighteenth centuries.</p>
