          <p>Hinds Cave occupies a classic Lower
              Pecos Canyonlands setting&#8212;a narrow side canyon off the lower
               Pecos River some 20 miles above where that river
              joins the larger and even more deeply incised Rio Grande. The generations
              and generations of native peoples who lived
              here led physically demanding lives climbing in and out
              of the canyons and trekking across the twisting and turning terrain 
              on daily rounds. While the dry rockshelters that preserved so much
              material evidence of ancient life continue to dominate our perception of their
              lives, prehistoric peoples  must have spent as much or more time in the rolling
              uplands.  To understand
              the natural setting of Hinds Cave, one must consider the ecology
              and physical constraints of the wider landscape as well as that
              of the small, sheltering canyon that houses the site.</p>
            <p>The cave is tucked the side of a 
              limestone  canyon less than
              a mile from the Pecos River. Today the narrow canyon is dry
              except for  short periods following heavy rains. The canyon
              floor below the site is fairly level and the lower canyon walls
              are only about 20 meters (65 feet) apart. The east wall of the
              canyon slopes away from the center of the canyon, while the west
              wall containing Hinds Cave rises almost vertically for some 30
              to 40 meters (100-130 feet). The limestone bedrock that forms the
              canyon floor is strewn with large rounded boulders and pitted with
              shallow pothole depressions known as <em><strong>tinajas</strong></em> that
              can hold water for days, weeks or even months following heavy rains. These shallow, temporary pools are a
              boon to wildlife, as they must have been to the native
              peoples who stopped at Hinds Cave.</p>
            <h3> Shelter </h3>
            <p>Technically, Hinds Cave is a rockshelter because it is much wider
              (37 meters or 121 feet) than it is deep (23 meters or 75 feet). The small alcove at one end of the shelter is a true cave, but not much of one. Hinds Cave  formed as a large solution cavity deep within in the Cretaceous limestone
                bedrock that was gradually bisected and exposed by canyon-cutting
                floodwaters and further shaped by eroding winds. These active geological
                processes did most of their work over long spans of geological
                time, tens of thousands of years before humans arrived on the scene. The
                  cavity has a high limestone ceiling and is quite typical of the
                  dry &ldquo;caves&rdquo; of the region except for its larger than
                  average size. </p>
            <p>Hinds Cave is high and very, very dry&mdash;perhaps 99% of its deposits are bone dry and have remained so for thousands of years because of the large overhang of the roof. Even blowing rains scarcely penetrate the dusty
                  dry cave. There is evidence of minor seepage along the rear wall
                  of the shelter that fostered the growth of tiny white crystals
                  in rock fissures. This seepage pales by comparison to the active
                  springs that issue forth from the cracked walls of some shelters,
                  particularly those that lie deep in the main canyons. </p>
            <p>The entrance to the shelter is about 20 meters (66 feet) above the canyon floor
              and can be reached by one of two ways. From the bottom of the canyon,
              the fastest route is a nearly  vertical climb up the rugged cliff
              face. From the uplands or from farther up the canyon, the best
              approach begins at the mouth of an even smaller tributary canyon
              that is more or less level with Hinds Cave. Following topographic
              lines, the visitor must slither across the sheer rock on tiny ledges
              loved only by sure-footed goats. Either way, access to Hinds Cave
              is physically and psychologically demanding and that may have afforded
              some protection to those who stayed here in troubled times past.</p>
            <p>Hinds Cave faces  northeast. Summer conditions in the shelter are hot, still, and sunny in
                the early morning, and shady and breezy (if incredibly dusty) throughout
                the rest of the day. It is undoubtedly the coolest afternoon spot
                in the immediate area unless you are immersed in the Pecos River.
                Space inside the shelter during both summer excavation seasons
                had to be shared with rock rattlesnakes, scorpions, canyon wrens,
                digging wasps, earth-moving bumblebees, and small bats. In the
                winter it is a less
                inviting place, and wildlife is gone from inside the shelter. Although temperatures remain fairly constant in
                the tight confines of the protected alcove, the main body of the
                shelter is cold and open to chilling winter breezes which blow occasionally
                from both directions in the side canyon. That is, north to northwest
                winds whip down the canyon while northeast to east winds seem to
                flow up the canyon. Either way, the shelter&rsquo;s usefulness
                as a refuge from bitter winter winds in prehistoric times would
                have been limited&#8212;there are far better situated rockshelters
                elsewhere in the canyonlands.</p>
            <h3> Landscape</h3>
            <p>One can picture the local landscape around Hinds Cave as having
              four major ecological zones or topographic layers. From higher to lower in the landscape these are the <strong>uplands</strong>, the <strong>edge</strong>,
              the <strong>canyon</strong>, and the <strong>river</strong>. These
              layers or zones framed the daily lives of the people who frequented
              Hinds Cave. From the shelter an agile teenager, for instance, could quickly
              move up slope and explore the upland-canyon edge and follow the
              slope up to the high uplands which stretch for many miles. Or our teenager
              could scamper down the steep face into the narrow confines of the
              canyon. From there, in less than an hour she could walk down the
              canyon floor, hop a few boulders, and follow the dry stream bed
              as it &ldquo;flows&rdquo; down step-like bedrock layers and reach
              the banks of the Pecos River.</p>
            <p>These four zones had (and still have) only partially overlapping
              sets of natural resources useful to humans&mdash;plants, animals,
              rocks, and water. For instance, if you wanted fish to eat,  like
              one of the eight species whose bones were found in Hinds Cave,
              you had to go down to the river. Likewise, if you wanted to find
              a thick stand of sotol, your best bet would be on the steep rocky
              slopes of the upland-canyon edge. Walnut trees favored the
              sheltered side canyons, and antelope could only be found in the
              high uplands. This is a bit simplified, but the major patterns
              and zones are quite real, and all Hinds Cave denizens would have
              known these like the backs of their weathered hands.</p>
            <p>The distinctive ecological characteristics of the four zones
              are caused by underlying factors&mdash; terrain, geology,
              soils, and water&mdash;that govern the distribution of natural
              resources. Briefly, let&rsquo;s consider each zone, starting at
              the top.</p>
            <p>The<strong> Uplands</strong> are broad expanses of essentially
              the same limestone plateaus that stretch east and north all the
              way to Austin and beyond. Nearest Hinds Cave, the uplands are sloped
              and irregular near the canyon fingers and flatten out on the divides.
              The high divides between the major river systems can be almost
              flat and unbroken. Within the uplands are low hills such as the
              Blue Hills that  lie about 20 miles north of Hinds Cave on the
              divide between the Pecos and Devils rivers. The uplands are typically
              dry and have very little natural surface water except right
              after rain along major draws.</p>
            <p>Today much of the uplands are extremely rocky and rough with hardly
              any soil and, as a consequence, relatively few remaining native
              grasses. This is mainly a sad fact of modern history. Beginning
              in the late 19th century, Val Verde County was heavily overgrazed
              by livestock (cattle and then sheep and goats), denuding the grass
              cover. After decades of grazing stress, the prolonged drought of the 1950s reduced grass cover to almost nothing. Then came the famed 1954 flood, the magnitude of which has been estimated to occur  once every 2,000 years (or less often). Without grass to anchor the soil, it washed away  in a mere blink of
                geological time. It was an environmental disaster that permanently marred the landscape. </p>
            <p>Only a century ago,  visitors  found the uplands
              much more hospitable. Soils were thin, but they covered most of
              the flatter bedrock expanses and supported an arid savannah&mdash;a
              mix of grass, brush and stunted trees. In the flat uplands, far
              away from the edges where there was more soil and more grasses
              and low trees, deer browsed regularly as did antelope and, during
                a few unusually wet periods when grasses grew thickly, bison. Male
                hunters probably roamed great distances over the uplands in search
                of large game. The distant uplands were, however,  poor places to
                find water or shelter most of the time and  no one stayed there
                for long. This was not place to live or camp for long (residential zone).</p>
            <p>The <strong>Edge </strong>is a transitional zone between the high
              uplands and the canyons. The terrain is sloping and rough, especially along
              the canyon rims, because there is little or no soil and lots of
              loose, sharp limestone rocks that have broken loose from the limestone
              bedrock. The upland-canyon edge provides several types of rocks
              used as raw materials. For instance, outcrops of chert (&ldquo;flint&rdquo;)
              nodules are exposed along the canyon edge not far from Hinds Cave.
              It is likely  that limestone slabs and chunks used as cooking
              stones were often collected along the edge. Limestone rocks
              are  common in the canyon, but it would have been a lot  easier to carry rocks
              down into the cave than to lug them up the steep canyon walls. </p>
            <p>The eroded edges of the uplands probably never had enough soil to support
              thick grasses. Instead this is where many arid-adapted species
              such as prickly pear cactus, sotol, and lechuguilla grew in thick
              stands. These stands were very important resources visited regularly
              by Hinds Cave peoples. We know this because there are many campsites
              on the edges of the uplands and many burned rock middens where
              plants were baked. In fact,  archeologists believe that the
              upland edges were important residential zones. Here people could
              spread out and stay comfortably near to the many resources found
              in the canyons below.</p>
            <p>The side <strong>Canyon</strong> that houses Hinds Cave was also
              a residential zone, albeit one used only sporadically during the warm months of the year. It may have also served as a convenient place to duck into during times when a naturally roofed and shaded house or a hidden spot was needed.  </p>
            <p>Hinds Cave is one of many side-canyon rockshelters that people
                occupied in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. But the old idea that
                people lived year round in the shelters, as more or less permanent
                base camps, is seen today as unrealistic. If even a small
                band of hunter-gatherers lived for long in one spot in one small
                canyon, they would quickly exhaust the easy-to-eat foods and burn
                up all the easy-to-harvest firewood.
                Our best guess today is that rockshelters were occasional stopping
                places that were visited seasonally for a few days or weeks and
                perhaps somewhat more frequently for temporary overnight shelter
                from storms and as convenient stopovers during short excursions
                into the canyons.</p>
            <p>The side canyons did have many useful resources, beginning with
              water. While the canyon containing Hinds Cave is dry today, its
              <em>tinajas</em> (potholes) can hold water for weeks. As recently as 1953,
              the canyon floor was a wetter place with a lot more soil and vegetation.
              The famed 1954 flood, estimated to represent a 2000-year flood, was simply the final
              nail sealing a coffin built by long-term overgrazing and soil erosion.
              According to rancher Carrol Hinds,   the narrow canyon bottoms were half &quot;covered with rich bottom soil&rdquo; before they were stripped
              to bedrock and filled with gravel. Prior to being scoured out,
              the side canyons were thickly vegetated by trees, brush, and vines, including
              many species, such as little black walnut trees and mustang grapevines,
               rarely found in the uplands.</p>
            <p>The Pecos <strong>River </strong>and its alluvium-filled valley
              was  a major resource zone and must have also served seasonally
              as a major residential zone. Carrol Hinds described the valley in the
              early 20th century as a more productive area than it is today.
              The river &ldquo;ran between two strips of rich sandy loam that
              was mostly covered with &hellip;grasses along with &hellip; high
              weeds &hellip; [and] very few trees.&rdquo; Trees were present but
              weren&rsquo;t as thick or as diverse as those in the protected
              side canyons. Today the valley has been stripped of some of its
              rich alluvium and choked with invading species of trees such as
              salt cedar, but the river  is still an inviting place to kayakers, fishermen,
              and swimmers. </p>
            <p>For hunting and gathering peoples of the past, the Pecos River
              was a unique and bountiful resource. In the Hinds Cave archeological
            record the most obvious riverine elements are the bones of many fish
            and other aquatic species including mussels (freshwater clams), soft-shell
            turtles, and frogs. Clearly, people went between  Hinds
            Cave and the river on a regular basis. The lower river valleys of the Devils and Pecos Rivers within the area now covered by Amistad Reservoir were major residential settlement zones. </p>
            <p>The degree to which the Pecos River
                valley nearest the site was also a residential zone is somewhat difficult to evaluate
                as not much archeological research has been done directly along its
                banks near Hinds Cave. Given the known magnitude of major floods
                in historic times&mdash;the Pecos River at the mouth of Lewis Canyon
                crested at 103 feet above its normal level in the 1954 flood&mdash;many
                sediment layers where past evidence would have been concentrated
                may not survive. Flood cycles, of course, occurred many times in
                the past, a factor that native peoples would have been well
                aware of. </p>

Its strong leaves were trimmed of their thorns (or not) and used to weave mats or separated into fibers for making cord and sandal straps.  Its dried stalk was used as a lightweight wood and as fuel.  And its leaf base or heart was baked and eaten, especially during the Late Archaic period at Hinds Cave.  Yucca was valued mainly as a source of tough fibers that come with a built-in needle (the thorn tip). TAMU Anthropology archives. </div>
