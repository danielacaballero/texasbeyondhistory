<div class="caption">Artist reconstruction of a Lower Pecos scene in the Late Pleistocene geological era, about 25,000 years ago.  Then, the climate was cooler and wetter and supported extensive grasslands where mammoths, camels, bison, and other "Ice Age" species roamed.

    <div id="twocol-l">
      <p>The modern climate of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands is semiarid and subtropical
        with dry, mild winters and hot summers. Rainfall averages 18 inches per
        year in Del Rio, the nearest major weather station. Hinds Cave lies some
        50 miles northwest of Del Rio and here the average rainfall is closer
        to 14 inches per year. Most of the rain falls in the warmer months from
        April to October. Fourteen inches of rain is not much and the average
        amount masks considerable year-to-year variation and the fact that most
        rain falls during brief but intense thunderstorms. Droughts occur frequently
        and may last for several years. The livelihoods of Val Verde County ranchers
        have always been tied closely to the weather&mdash;periods of prolonged drought  are
        economic low points that not all local ranchers  survive. The same was doubtlessly true
        for prehistoric peoples living off the land. </p>
      <p>Over the last 25,000 years, the climatic conditions affecting Hind Cave
        have not remained constant. The general long-term pattern has been
        a prolonged shift from cooler and wetter to warmer and drier conditions
        like those that prevail today. But this shift has been interrupted and
        sometimes even briefly reversed by shorter term climatic shifts lasting
        a few hundred or a few thousand years. Humans, however, would have been
        much more aware of and impacted by even shorter, comparatively brief
        climatic events such as drought cycles lasting a only few decades or a few
        years. Even a few unusually wet months would have created locally favorable
        conditions for plants, animals, and people. These brief climatic events
        are mostly invisible in the archeological and climatic record of the
        prehistoric past. Instead, we can usually discern only relatively long
        term major shifts.</p>
      <p>Here we will try to present a fairly realistic picture of what prevailing
        climatic conditions would have been like for those who visited Hinds
        Cave. To do this we have to consider lines of evidence from different
        materials and different localities and read a lot between the lines.
        To reconstruct the paleoenvironment, researchers track through time the presence&#8212;or absence&#8212;of certain plants and animals that are highly sensitive to climatic change. Samples of pollen, preserved plant parts, and certain animal bones help tell this story. Stream- and river-bank deposits may testify to alternating periods of intense flooding and slow flow. </p>
      <p>The evidence at Hinds Cave only covers a 9,500 year period beginning
          around 8,500 B.C. The cave does not preserve  an unbroken, ideal climatic record. Instead
          it is a complex archeological site into which people selectively hauled all sorts of things, such as
          plants laden with pollen, which may have left misleading  climatic signals Those items then became  mixed  with other things as occupants tromped 
          about, dug holes, and so on. Adding to the problem is the reality  that they routinely
          used plant remains as fuel and as packing materials for earth-oven baking,
          a process that added literally tons of burned rocks and lots of ash and
          charcoal into the deposits. In other words, it is impossible to accurately
          reconstruct climate conditions based solely on the tampered evidence
          from Hinds Cave.</p>
      <p>We know from fossil pollen records of other localities in the region
        that around 25,000 years ago the Hinds Cave region would have been much
        cooler and wetter than it is today. Based on this evidence, we infer
        that the average temperature variations between summers and winters would
        not have been as great as they are today. Winters would have been long and cold,
        snowfalls would have covered the ground during much of the winter, and
        water dripping into cracks in the limestone walls of rockshelters would have expanded as it froze. That process, called
        ice wedging, would have been repeated over and over again each winter
        causing thin sheets of limestone to flake off the ceilings and side walls
        of rockshelters forming thick layers of broken rocks and rubble (called
        spalls) on the shelter&rsquo;s surface. Later, during the warmer summers,
        rain water, containing weak amounts of carbonic  acid, would seep into
        shelters  and dissolve the fallen spalls to piles of tiny,
        dust-size particles. The deepest and earliest deposits at Hinds Cave
        are composed mostly of cave dust and limestone spalls, but we do not
        know precisely when they formed&mdash;just sometime before 11,000 years ago.</p>
      <p>During the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (around 25,000 years ago) winters
        would have been long and cold with frequent overcast skies and a constant
        north wind that would chill the region. Summers would have been warm
        and moist with cold nights, much like today&rsquo;s summers in regions
        of central Colorado. The canyon below Hinds Cave probably supported stands
        of junipers, pinyon and ponderosa pines, and even a few spruce trees.
        The uplands &ldquo;above&rdquo; and surrounding Hinds Cave would have
        been covered by patchy areas of grasses mixed with waist-high bushes
        of sagebrush (<em>Artemisia</em>). That type of mixed grass-sagebrush
        vegetation would have provided an ideal habitat for grass and shrub grazing
        animals including the mammoth, mastodon, camel, horse, and large bison.
        These Ice Age animals all died out between 18,000 to 11,000 years ago,
        mainly as a consequence of a warming climate. </p>
      <p>As the climates in North America began to warm,
        the continental glacier began to retreat toward its present location
        near the North Pole. With that glacial retreat came changes in wind patterns
        and temperatures. We suspect that much of that change was caused by a
        gradual northward shift in the path of the upper atmosphere&rsquo;s jet
        stream. During this period of change, called the Late Glacial, climate
        ameliorated and precipitation increased from the cooler, drier Full Glacial
        period. Winter snows still fell at Hinds Cave and pools of water in the
        canyon floor below the shelter still froze solid, as did the margins
        of the nearby Pecos River. Winter days were not quite as cold nor did
        the winters last as long. Summers were cooler and wetter. Overall, the
        Late Glacial climate was milder and perhaps more inviting for humans.</p>
      <p>During the millennia just prior to the dawning of the Holocene (modern geological
        era) around 11,000 years ago, the climate became noticeably warmer and
        drier. The cold-loving plants growing near Hinds Cave lost their dominance
        and finally disappeared. The ponderosa and pinyon pines disappeared from
        the canyon slopes as their new seedlings encountered summers too hot
        and dry for them to survive. Soon there were no more pines growing near
        Hinds Cave. The last cooler-wetter plants to disappear were probably
        the juniper bushes and trees that may have survived into the early part
        of the Holocene in protected areas of the canyon below Hinds Cave. But,
        sometime before 8,000-9,000 years ago they too disappeared locally as
        the summers continued to get hotter and drier.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in the uplands above Hinds Cave, the cold-loving sagebrush 
        bushes and hardy winter grasses could no longer tolerate the drier and
        hotter summers and began to thin around 15,000 years ago and were almost gone by 11,000 years ago. Like
        the pines and spruce, they too disappeared leaving behind new areas covered
        with temperate-climate grasses and new types of small, shrubby bushes
        and trees such as scrub oaks, mountain laurel, and sumac.</p>
      <p>At some point during the Late Glacial period between 18,000-11,000 years
        ago, the first groups of Native Americans entered the Lower Pecos region
        and began making the area near Hinds Cave their new home. Evidence that
        they were here is seen in the deposits from a number of nearby sites,
        especially Bonfire Shelter located only a few miles southwest of Hinds
        Cave (see <a href="../bonfire/index.html">Bonfire exhibit</a>). There, skilled early Native Americans
        hunted some of the last large Ice-Age game animals in North America before
        those animals  became extinct. Bonfire Shelter contains unmistakable traces
        of broken artifacts and the bones of large animals that they smashed while butchering their
        game. Perhaps these same groups visited Hinds Cave as well. If they did,
        the record of their early visit is still buried beneath tons of dirt in those areas of Hinds Cave that have not been fully examined. </p>
      <p>With the relatively rapid change in climate from cool to hot and from wet to dry
        around 11,000 years ago, the local vegetation became highly stressed.
        The cold-loving plant species, which could no longer survive, disappeared.
        It was during this transition period that sudden, and often heavy, rains
        created flash floods that swept away much of the unguarded topsoil from
        upland sites and turned the canyons into torrents of water that ripped
        away the talus soils and vegetation growing on the slopes of the Hinds
        Cave canyon.</p>
      <p>Within one thousand years after the onset of the Holocene (11,000 years
        ago) much had changed in the Hinds Cave region. At some point before
        the beginning of Holocene all of the abundant big game animals in the
        region disappeared. Gone were the mammoths, mastodons, horses, giant
        Pleistocene bison, camels, and even the sabertooth cats that once preyed
        on those large animals. Gone also were the spruce, pines, junipers, and
        sagebrush. In the place of these lost plants and animals came a host
        of new invaders. Desert-loving plant species such as agave, yucca, sotol,
        cactus, buckthorns, acacias, and mesquite expanded from more sheltered
        canyon areas and came to dominate the area&rsquo;s vegetation. Smaller game animals including deer, modern bison, rabbits, wolves, and cougars filled the ecological niches previously used by large Pleistocene animals. </p>
      <p>On the talus slopes and in the canyon below Hinds Cave deposits of windblown
        sand and dirt accumulated and encouraged new species of plants to take
        root. Bushes and trees including cottonwoods, oaks, sumac, willows, hackberry,
        persimmon, and mountain laurel filled the canyon floor and talus slopes.
        Mustang grape and poison ivy vines wound their way upward through the
        branches of oak trees and, on the ground, buffalo gourds, grasses, sedges,
        and various types of berry bushes competed for the rich soils. Some of
        the larger and deeper potholes in the canyon floor below Hinds Cave held
        water throughout the year and provided essential water for game animals
        while it also supported a variety of small fish, amphibians, and reptiles.</p>
      <p>Between 11,000 years ago until around 8,000 years ago the area around
        Hinds Cave may have seemed a bit like a Garden of Eden to those who lived
        there. The climate was much warmer than it had been before 11,000 years
        ago. Although the winter winds were still cold, it rarely snowed and
        the skies were mostly clear and sunny during the day. The nearby Pecos
        River provided both a permanent water source and a place to swim and
        cool off during the hottest summer afternoons. By 9,000 years ago, the plants that people brought into Hinds Cave are the same ones growing near the shelter today, signaling the establishment of the modern environment. </p>
      <p>Around 8,000 years ago some significant climatic changes occurred in
        the Hinds Cave region. Hotter and drier conditions heralded the establishment
        of a more or less modern climate regime with relatively dry, cool winters
        and hot summers. Amid the generally drier conditions, there were occasional
        violent, transformative events caused by stalled tropical storms. During
        these infrequent  events, massive thunderstorms unleashed torrents of water
        that swept rapidly across the unprotected uplands capped with impervious limestone and down into canyons and
        river valleys causing flash flooding and widespread erosion. Some scientists
        believe that a shift in upper wind patterns around 8,000 years ago carried
        moisture-laden clouds that formed over the Pacific Coast and Gulf of Mexico much further inland where they created extensive
        and heavy downpours of such intensity that they resulted in repeated
        cycles of flooding and erosion. We remain uncertain about what actually
        triggered the changes, but the results seen in the profiles of riverbank deposits today, must have been  dramatic.</p>
      <p>Some scientists call this time period the Altithermal, which they believe 
        lasted around 3,000 years. Current speculations tag the  Altithermal as a period
        of extreme dryness and very hot summers and mild winters and is believed to have affected  much of west Texas
        and most of the American Southwest. The climatic changes during this 3,000 year
        interval are written in the deposits of archeological sites along the
        Pecos River, such as Arenosa Shelter, and along the Rio Grande and Devils
        Rivers, at sites such as the Devil&rsquo;s Mouth Site. At both Arenosa and Devil's Mouth, 
        the deposits record repeated intervals of terrible floods that stripped
        the sites of older soils and replaced them with  new deposits of sand and clay as the rivers
        receded. It seems likely that the canyon below Hinds Cave may have flooded
        repeatedly during this 3,000 year period, but the cave's deposits show that flood waters were  never
         high enough to reach the rockshelter.</p>
      <p>The climate during the last 4,000 years at Hinds Cave was probably very
        similar to conditions in that area today, except for one brief period
        around 2,800 years ago. Pollen records and plant remains recovered from
        Hinds Cave deposits during this 4,000 year period show little variation
        suggesting that aside from slight variations in rainfall or temperatures
        from year to year, the climate and local vegetation probably remained
        fairly stable. Winter freezes became less common, summers remained warm
        to hot, and annual rainfall was quite variable with periodic droughts
        lasting many months or even years.</p>
      <p>One climatic event, around 2,800 years ago (800 B.C.), is not evident
        in the deposits of Hinds Cave, but it is recorded in the fossil pollen
        records of deposits at other sites both east and west of Hinds Cave.
        At Bonfire Shelter, less than 10 miles away to the southwest, a thick
        layer of bison bones dates to about 800 B.C. The layer shows that skilled
        hunters succeeded in stampeding hundreds of bison over the cliff above
        the shelter during one or several closely spaced events (see <a href="../bonfire/index.html">Bonfire
        exhibit</a>). We infer that bison migrated southward into the region
        in search of winter grasses, perhaps in response to extremely cold winters in their normal haunts, the central and southern
        Plains hundreds of miles to the north of Hinds Cave. The pollen record
        from the Devil&rsquo;s Mouth site about 40 miles southeast of Hinds Cave
        also reflects a brief cool and wet interval at about the same time (roughly
        2500-3000 years ago). While the brief shift to cooler and wetter conditions
        must have also affected those people using Hinds Cave,  no evidence of this has yet been found. </p>
      <p>By 2,500 years ago, the gradual warming and drying trend returned to form climatic conditions similar to those of today with dry and mild winters and hot summers.
      Droughts were frequent and sometimes prolonged, lasting years and even
      decades or longer. Evidence from elsewhere in North America and in the
      Northern Hemisphere suggests there have been minor but significant global
      climatic shifts that would have impacted the region. For instance, the
      so-called &ldquo;Little Ice Age&rdquo; between A.D. 1350-1850 saw colder
      winters and increased moisture in many areas. Perhaps future studies will determine if such events played a role in the climatic history of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. </p>
