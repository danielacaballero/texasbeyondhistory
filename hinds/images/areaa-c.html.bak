<h1>Area A and the A-C Trench</h1>
<p>Area A was first excavated in 1975 and was selected as a major area for sampling
  plant remains from the fiber-rich deposits visible there in the edges of nearby
  holes dug by artifact collectors. The artifact hunters, in fact, had inadvertently
  protected part of Area A by piling up their backdirt there. Once the backdirt
  was removed, other looter holes were found and sides of these were cleaned
  up and used to guide excavation in a relatively undisturbed area. Two narrow
  trenches were dug and combined with the cleaned up looter hole exposures, resulting
  in the isolation of a rectangular block measuring 1.6 by 1.8 m (5.3 by 5.9
  feet) known as the A Block.</p>
  <p>The A Block was divided into two halves, designated A-West (Unit AW) and
    A-East (Unit AE). Each half was excavated by peeling off each lens visible
    in profile; the lenses were numbered sequentially from the top. At the end
    of the 1975 season, the upper section of Area A had been excavated. In 1976,
    the lower section was excavated in the same fashion until bedrock floor of
    the shelter was reached between 1.5 and 2.3 m beneath the surface (the natural
    floor sloped from back to front).</p>
  <p>The Area A deposits were used as the primary basis for defining the site&rsquo;s
    analysis units (stratigraphic zones) because the entire stratigraphic sequence
    was preserved in this area. </p>
  <p>The A-C Trench was dug in 1976 to connect Areas A and C and provide a profile view of the structure
      of the shelter&rsquo;s
    deposits from back to front. The A-C Trench measured 1.5 m wide and 4.5 m
      long and was excavated in three units measuring about 1.5-x-1.5 m (Units
      AC1, AC2, and AC3). </p>
