      <p><strong> Lesson Title: </strong> Comparing Two Cultures &ndash; Hinds
        Cave and Yours</p>
      <p><strong> Subject: </strong> Texas history &amp; geography </p>
      <p><strong> Grade level: </strong>  7th grade </p>
      <p><strong> Rationale or Purpose:</strong> In this lesson students compare
        their own culture with that of prehistoric people who camped at Hinds
        Cave in the Lower Pecos region of Texas thousands of years ago. Students
        become familiar with lesson-related vocabulary terms (in English and
        Spanish), locate Hind&rsquo;s Cave on a map, make cultural comparisons
        using a graphic organizer, and write a comparison/contrast essay on the
        two cultures.</p>

  </ul>
      <p><strong> Activity: </strong></p>
      <p> Step 1: Display the overhead transparency of Hinds Cave. Ask students
        to describe the physical geography around the cave. Possible answers
        include dry, semiarid, desert like, rocky, hilly, etc.</p>
      <p> Step 2 (optional) If students are not familiar with this lesson&rsquo;s
        vocabulary words, introduce them on an overhead transparency or write
        them on the board and briefly define them aloud. Note: Spanish translations
        are included.</p>
      <p> Step 3: Explain that nomadic hunting and gathering people traveling
        through southwest Texas often stopped at Hinds Cave for temporary shelter
        during the Archaic era. Such caves were usually inhabited by groups the
        size of an extended family, or around 12 people . Ask students to brainstorm
        a few examples of how living in such a cave 1,000 &ndash; 6,000 years
        ago would compare to living in their homes today. Explain that in this
        lesson, they will explore the culture of Hinds Cave and compare it to
        and contrast it with their own culture.</p>
      <p> Step 3:<strong></strong> Display the overhead transparency, Map of
        Hinds Cave. Point out that the cave is located on the Pecos River and
        have students locate this area on a map or Texas. Step 4: Distribute
        the Comparing Two Cultures graphic organizer. Explain that students will
        compare their own culture to that of Hinds Cave by filling out the Comparing
        Two Cultures graphic organizer, then use the information they collected
        to write a comparison-contrast essay on the two cultures.</p>
      <p> Step 4: Explain that Hinds Cave is protected beneath a prominent limestone
        overhang and because it exists in a semiarid region of Texas where the
        dry climate has produced almost perfect preservation conditions, archeologists
        have found a wealth of information about the people who camped there
        over the centuries. Objects found intact in Hinds Cave include artifacts,
        such as intricate tools, weapons, basketry, sandals, wood, and chipped
        stone. Also found were more than 2,000 well preserved coprolites which
        tell us much about what these people ate.</p>
      <p> Step 5: Distribute student copies of the Comparing Two Cultures graphic
        organizer. If necessary, display an overhead transparency of the graphic
        organizer to help students get started. To fill in the first two sections
        of the organizer, students will need access to their Texas history textbooks,
        the Texas Almanac, or some other source of information that can help
        them describe the location and climate where they live. Have students
        work with a partner to fill in the rest of their graphic organizers.</p>
      <p> Step 6: Using their completed graphic organizers for reference, have
        students write a comparison-contrast essay on their own culture and that
        of Hinds Cave.</p>
      <p><strong> Modification: </strong> Highlight pertinent geographic information
        for special needs students and have them use fewer categories on the
        graphic organizer. Use Spanish vocabulary for ESL students.</p>
      <p><strong> Student Product: </strong> A completed Culture Comparison graphic
        organizer and a comparison-contrast essay.</p>
      <p><strong> Closure: </strong> Ask students if they&rsquo;ve ever been
        camping, and if so, how primitive their experiences were. Answers will
        vary from camping in an RV with TV and air-conditioning to primitive
        tent camping. Have students relate how their camping experiences differed
        from their everyday lives.</p>
      <p><strong> Assessment: </strong> Have students list the five things they
        would miss most from their own culture if they had to live in Hinds Cave
        for a week. Let students read their lists aloud and see if there are
        some common elements among their lists.</p>
      <p><strong> Extensions: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> To discover more about Hinds Cave coprolites and the interesting
          surprises they contain, visit Dr. Dirt, the armadillo archeologist
          who guides students through the interactive <em>Detectives into the
          Past</em>: <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/hinds/detectives.html">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/hinds/detectives.html</a></li>
  </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> Bake a batch of Chocolate Chip Coprolite Cookies, using the recipe
          handout at the end of this lesson. Don&rsquo;t worry, they&rsquo;re
          not real coprolites! They&rsquo;re chocolate oatmeal cookies with lots
          of ingredients that make them look like coprolites. See which of your
          students will volunteer first to do a taste test! </li>
  </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> Have students keep a log of everything they eat in a 24 hour period.
          Ask them to break down the components of all their foods as much as
          possible when entering them into their logs. For example, a hamburger
          contains a meat patty, but also may contain pickles (cucumbers, vinegar,
          spices), mayonnaise (eggs, vegetable oil), cheese (milk), and a bun
          (flour, salt, baking powder, etc.). Then ask them to imagine that a
          future archeologist is analyzing their culture by studying the foods
          they ate. What can students say about their own culture after studying
          the foods they eat? Point out to students that Americans have access
          to foods from all over the world that are available at almost any given
          time. How does such a diet compare to prehistoric diets such as those
          consumed at Hind&rsquo;s Cave? To find out more, have students link
          to <em>the What&rsquo;s for Dinner?</em> page in the <em>Kids Only</em> section
          of Texas Beyond History:<a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/dinner/index.html">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/dinner</a></li>
  </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> Send away for owl pellets and dissect them in class (owls regurgitate
          the bones of their prey neatly wrapped in fur). Or, visit the following
          website and do a virtual owl pellet dissection: <a href="http://www.kidwings.com/owlpellets/index.htm">http://www.kidwings.com/owlpellets/ind
          ex.htm</a></li>
