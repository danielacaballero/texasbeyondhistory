<h1>Area D </h1>
<p>A 1-x-2 m test pit, dug as two 1-x-1 m units (D-1 and D-2), was placed within
  a fairly deep looter hole early in the 1975 season to probe the shelter&rsquo;s
  deeper deposits. The units essentially squared-off and cleaned back the looter
  hole and then continued downward. These units were dug in artificial levels
  10-centimeters thick, an expedient method. (Most other units at Hinds Cave
  were excavated by natural stratigraphy.) While the arbitrary levels allowed
  relatively fast excavation, the horizontal levels cut across several stratigraphic
  layers, resulting in mixed-age samples. Nonetheless, Area D showed that the
  shelter&rsquo;s deposits extended to at least 3.2 meters before the sloping
  bedrock floor was encountered. Perishable materials and coprolite lenses were
  sampled in the intact lower deposits. </p>
