<div class="caption"><em>Very intensively heated limestone
          rocks found within Lens 4 in the A Block excavations crumbled into
          pure lime when excavators struck them. Most of the surrounding rocks
          within this burned rock midden deposit remained quite hard despite
          being fractured by heating while being used as cooking stones. The
          crumbly rocks were heated very intensively, to far higher temperatures
          than ordinarily reached during hot rock cooking, but whether this was
          intentional or not is unknown. Historic period masons create lime for
          plaster and cement by intensively heating limestone in kilns, but there
      is no evidence that the prehistoric peoples of the region did so. </em></div>
