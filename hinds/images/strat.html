<h1>Stratigraphy</h1>

<div class="caption">This isometric view of the stratigraphy
    of the central part of Hinds Cave shows how some of the major deposits correlate
    with one another. Notice how the deposits slope from back to front (more
    or less left to right in this drawing) as does the bedrock floor of the shelter.
    In the Area A section of the drawing, it is clear that the deposits thickened
    toward the front of the cave. Interpretive drawing by Joe Saunders (Saunders
    1986: Figure 2.4).</div>
<p>The deposits in Hinds Cave formed over at least 11,000 years, beginning at
    least as early as Late Paleoindian times before 9,250 B.C. and continuing
  into modern times. The deposits consisted of a few predominately natural layers
    and many layers composed mostly of cultural materials &ndash; things that
    people  brought into the cave in prehistoric times. The natural layers were mainly
    limestone cave dust with some limestone roof spalls and an admixture of small,
    broken animal bones probably left by predators (in owl pellets, for instance).
    But most layers were made up mainly of cultural debris including thick layers
    of plant fiber and fragmented burned rocks (spent cooking stones), and thinner
    layers of ash, prickly pear pads, and human waste (feces and urine-compacted
    soil). In general, the lower deposits had more cave dust and less fiber,
    while the upper deposits had thick and extremely well preserved fiber. The
    uppermost deposits were disturbed by livestock, mainly goats, and augmented
    by their dung.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, if not earlier, people began to dig into the deposits in search
    of perishable artifacts. There is no telling how many different collectors
    dug into the site &ndash; many of them sneaked  onto the property from the nearby
    Pecos River without the landowner&rsquo;s knowledge. It was, in fact, a collector
    who first alerted archeologists to the existence of Hinds Cave. By the mid-1970s
    when the archeological investigations took place, most of the uppermost deposits
    in the rear and relatively flat areas of the shelter had been churned up
    by digging and many items probably including at least one infant bundle burial
    had been removed by collectors. The archeologists from Texas A&amp;M excavated
    no more than 5% of the site &ndash; some 50 cubic meters. They removed and saved all
    of the artifacts and much of the plant and animal remains they encountered.
    The current condition of the shelter is not known, but there were reports
    of continued uncontrolled digging in the 1980s and 1990s. We suspect that
    none of the upper deposits remain intact today.</p>
  <p>The stratigraphy (layering) of the Hinds Cave deposits was very complex
    and consisted of easily visible layers the excavators called &ldquo;<strong>lenses</strong>&rdquo; (macro-layers),
    some of which were made up of many thin micro-layers or lamina. The lenses
    ranged in thickness from less than 5 centimeters (2 inches) to more than
    a meter (over 3 feet). The micro-layers were sometimes paper-thin&mdash;just
    a few millimeters (less than 1/8 th of an inch) and often impossible to peel
    apart. The layering was not, however, arranged in a textbook layer-cake fashion.
    Instead many of the layers were convoluted and reflected the fact that Hinds
    Cave was dug into many times by prehistoric peoples and, in some areas of the cave, by critters such as
    burrowing animals. When Hinds Cave was being used, its   the surface  would have been quite uneven and marred by pits, piles, and winding paths. Through time, these topographic features weathered and filled in with loose sediments. </p>
  <p>The people who lived in the cave dug various pits that the archeologists
    could recognize and, doubtlessly, many more that could not be traced. Some of the
    visible pits were used for cooking or food processing and others were used
    for sleeping, such as the shallow pits filled with layers of grass. The archeologists
    called the discrete pits and other special layers <strong>features</strong> and
    paid special attention to these because they realized that most represented
    a single occupational event or series of closely spaced events that happened
    during one particular use episode.</p>
  <p>Recognizing, following, and keeping track of all these lenses and features
    and their contents was a major challenge made all the more difficult because
    Hinds Cave was excavated during two major seasons, a year apart. The field
    crew was made up of a mix of trained archeologists and their assistants, volunteers, graduate students, and undergraduates, most of whom were learning on the job. Personnel changed from year to year,
    although two  key graduate students&#8212;Glenna Williams-Dean and Phil Dering,
    and staff archeologist Ed Baxter&#8212;served as supervisors throughout both seasons of  work.</p>
  <p>The excavation and recording methods also changed during the course of the
    project as the archeologists learned more about the site and devised more
    sophisticated ways of separating the layers. For instance, the first year
    several small units were dug in arbitrary levels 10 or 20 centimeters thick.
    Soon the complexity of the layering was apparent and the first test pits
    and cleaned out holes left by looters  to guide later excavations by &ldquo;natural
    layers.&rdquo; This term  means that the excavators followed &quot;naturally&quot; existing layers, rather  than arbitrary levels. Sometimes the natural layers were quite thick
    and lacked visible internal subdivisions, so arbitrary subdivisions within those thick layers were used to  determine whether different kinds of materials were present within
    the thicker layers.</p>
  <p>After returning from the site for the last time after a final brief work session in 1978,
    the archeologists realized that they needed to simplify the stratigraphy
    for analysis and meaningful comparison between excavation areas. During the
    earlier salvage excavations at nearby Amistad Reservoir (see <a href="../../pecos/before.html">Before
    Amistad</a>), the archeologists typically lumped the smaller layers
    into major <strong>zones</strong> representing thicker deposits that could
    be fairly easily traced. Lead investigator Harry Shafer collapsed the Hinds
    Cave lenses into eight <strong>analysis units</strong>, which are equivalent
    to the zones used by the Amistad archeologists. These are described in the <a href="analysis.html">Analysis
    Units</a> section.</p>
  <p>Detailed profiles and profile descriptions were carefully done by the field
    archeologists. Unfortunately, no detailed and fully labeled final versions
    of any these have been published. Redrawn and simplified profile drawings
    have been published by several Hinds researchers and these can be accessed within this online exhibit. </p>
