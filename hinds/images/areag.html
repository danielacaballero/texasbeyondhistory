<h1>Area G </h1>
<p> The alcove or small cave-like anteroom at the southeastern of the shelter
  had been badly disturbed by artifact collectors. It is thought that the collectors
  completely removed fiber deposits possibly including a bundle burial from the
  alcove. About 80 centimeters (32 inches) remained of the lower fill, which
  consisted of a light-colored mixture of ash, cave dust and roof spalls. This
  extremely dry fill had a powder-like consistency and did not have recognizable
  layering. Four small excavation units were excavated to sample the lower deposits
  and were designated G1-G4 (three measuring 1-x-1 m and another 1-x-1.4 m, G1-G4).
  Lacking clear stratigraphy, arbitrary levels were used. Excellent samples of
  stone tools and bones were recovered, but it is clear that the deposits were
  of mixed age as the projectile points included Middle and Early Archaic as
  well as Late Paleoindian </p>
