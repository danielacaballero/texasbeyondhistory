<h1>Areas B and E </h1>
<p>When archeologists first began work at Hinds Cave they observed numerous coprolites
  the looter backdirt piles along the southwest wall of the shelter. Intact deposits
  were visible in the walls of looter holes and it could be seen that a sizable
  area of undisturbed deposits remained. Area B was excavated to expose latrine
  deposits and collect coprolites and associated materials. This area proved
  to be the most informative of any at Hinds Cave, in part because of the nature
  of the deposits and due to the careful excavation and sampling methods followed
  in Area B. Glenda W. Dean supervised the work here and took copious notes while
  Ed Baxter did most of the digging.</p>
  <p>The work began here in 1975. First, the walls of a deep looter hole were
    cleaned up and cut back to provide a stratigraphic exposure (Unit B1). Two
    coprolite lenses were observed and it was decided to isolate a block measuring
    1.5-x-1.5 m. Next a sequence of five small narrow units (Units B2-B6) were
    dug on three sides, with the rear wall of the shelter forming the fourth
    side of the Area B Block (or Block B.)</p>
  <p>Using the natural stratigraphy (visible layers) exposed on three sides,
    the excavators peeled back layer after layer of the Block B deposits. These
    layers, termed lenses, were numbered sequentially from the top. The intact
    deposits were systematically excavated and removed to a depth of just over
    a meter below the surface by the end of the 1975 season. Massive lenses of
    coprolites and urine-compacted soil had been encountered&mdash;these represent
    an obvious long-term latrine location against the rear wall of the shelter.
    The thickest and lowest lens reached in 1975 was designated B-13. In 1976,
    the Area B excavations continued, reaching a depth of 2.0 to 2.5 m below
    the original shelter surface. Additional latrine layers were encountered
    and sampled in the lower section of Block B.</p>
  <p>Immediately south of Area B, a 1.25-x-1.5 m unit was excavated in 1975 and
    designated Area E. Areas B and E were connected with a small unit dubbed
    Trench B-E that ran along the rear wall of the shelter. Additional latrine
    and midden lenses were encountered in the Area E and B-E excavations, adding
    to the sample of stratified coprolite lenses found in Area B.</p>
  <p>For purposes of discussion and analyses of grouped data (such as Lord&rsquo;s
    faunal study) Units/Areas B, E and B-E are often considered together. The
    stratigraphic record of &ldquo;greater&rdquo; Area B is the most complete
    of any area at Hinds Cave because intact upper deposits were present. Good
    samples were obtained from almost all of the Analysis Units (except AU 6).
    The stratified latrine deposits have proven extremely important. Dean analyzed
    a large sample of the Lens 13 coprolites for her dissertation study and Stock
    included coprolites from deeper Area B lenses in her work. The calibrated
    midpoints of the 15 radiocarbon dates obtained from Area B samples range
    from about 200 B.C. to 6100 B.C.</p>
