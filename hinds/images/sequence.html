<h1>Hinds Cave Point Sequence</h1>

<p> One of the most useful and expedient dating methods takes advantage of the fact
  that projectile point styles changed through prehistoric time. Over time, hunters
  and flintknappers (most men were probably both) tried new manufacturing techniques
  and changed design of their hunting points in response to functional considerations,
  raw material availability, and human preference. During any period in time,
  only a few (sometimes maybe only one) point styles were in use, although there
  were often many minor variations on a theme. This pattern enables archeologists
  to use projectile points as &ldquo;time markers.&rdquo; For most recognized
  point styles, we know approximately&ndash;give or take 200-1000 years or so&mdash;when
  the style was in use. We know this after many decades of defining stratigraphic
  sequences of point styles and working out <strong>relative dating</strong> (type
  x consistently found below type y, hence x older than y) and from obtaining
  radiocarbon dates for deposits containing one or several related point styles.
  From this work, chronological <strong>projectile point sequences</strong> have
  been developed for most archeological regions in Texas, some more precise than
  others.</p>
<p>Deep cultural deposits that formed beneath overhangs in rockshelters such
  as Hinds Cave do not provide ideal opportunities to create an accurate projectile
  point sequence. The cultural deposits within the cave reached a maximum depth
  of well over two meters (6+ feet). Since the deposits were almost entirely
  artificial and were not laid down in uniform layers like some geological deposits,
  they do not represent an uninterrupted temporal sequence. Lenses of debris
  would form in one area of the cave and not another during cave use events.
  Entire occupation episodes may have been confined only to one segment of the
  site, resulting in an occupational hiatus in one area and a continuum in another.
  The cave&rsquo;s inhabitations frequently dug pits into underlying lenses and
  layers, bringing up and mixing materials from previous occupations with current
  ones. The loose dusty cave deposits also were amenable to mixing as occupants
  carried out other ordinary daily activities within the cave, wearing rutted
  paths, cleaning off areas, piling up debris piles, and so on</p>
<p>Even with these circumstances, however, extended periods of occupation during
  certain time intervals did occur, and these broad deposits did have stratigraphic
  integrity, meaning that entire layers formed that essentially date to a limited
  period of site use. The time intervals for these long episodes include: 8,900-5,500
  (radiocarbon years) B.P. with Baker and Early Barbed point style association,
  5,500-4,100 B.P. with Pandale and Pandale preform types association, 4,100-3,200
  B.P. with Langtry, Val Verde, and Pedernales associations, and 2,300-1,300
  B.P. with Ensor and Frio types association</p>
<p>Deep alluvial deposits provide a more ideal circumstance for constructing
  a lithic sequence. Indeed, the Lower Pecos projectile point sequence is based
  on half a century of off and on research and typological studies. Sites such
  as Devil&rsquo;s Mouth, Devils Rockshelter, and Arenosa Shelter have provided
  more ideal circumstances for constructing a point sequence for the region since
  these sites were subjected to geological conditions, namely alluvial flooding
  which deposited sterile deposits between cultural deposits. (See <strong><a href="../../pecos/before.html">Before
  Amistad</a></strong>  to learn more.) Sequences of sealed cultural deposits
  provided a more opportune situation to construct a well dated projectile point
  type sequence.</p>
<p>The Hinds Cave point sequence reflected by the raw counts of projectile points from all excavation proveniences assigned to each  Analysis Unit suggests that a considerable amount of mixing took place. This mixing is at least partially more apparent than real. That is, the initial Analysis Unit (AU) assignments have not been  critically reevaluated using the full radiocarbon dating results and the information gleaned from many different Hinds Cave laboratory research projects. Thus, some of the apparent mixing is simply the result of faulty AU assignments, not actual mixing. There were numerous deposits in Hinds Cave that did contain materials of mixed age owing to the factors discussed in the <a href="strat.html">Stratigraphy </a>and <a href="analysis.html">Analysis Unit</a> sections. </p>
<p>Nonethless,  the overall trends
    in the Hinds Cave point sequence match the chronology established for the region. Radiocarbon dates taken from stratigraphic profiles do show a very consistent
    chronological record of accumulations through time. Furthermore, the solid
    stratigraphic sequence of components containing Ensor, Langtry and Val Verde,
    Pandale, Bandy and Early Barbed is consistent with the regional projectile
  point sequence.</p>
<p>The point sequence at Hinds Cave reveals major occupation gaps within the
  Hinds Cave sequence. For instance, Late Prehistoric occupation at the site
  was represented by a mere trace (three arrow points) and could not be stratigraphically
  defined. Also notable is the poor representation for the interval between 3150
  and 2300 B.P. characterized by broad blade point styles Montell, Castroville,
  Marshall, and Shumla. Single examples of Montell and Marshall are present suggesting
  the site was only briefly occupied during this period of time compared to extensive
  periods of occupation for the intervals mentioned above. </p>

From top to bottom (and left to right), the six rows are as follows: Late Prehistoric arrow points, Late Archaic dart points (two Ensor, Frio), late Middle Archaic (Langtry, two Val Verde), early Middle Archaic (two Pandale performs, two Pandale), Early Archaic (two Bandy, Early Barbed); and Late Paleoindian (Golondrina).
