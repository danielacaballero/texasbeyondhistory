          <p>Here we summarize what has been learned
              about daily living  at Hinds Cave. Boiling down the
              story of 9,000 years of intermittent use of the site leaves us
              with a  picture of a way of life    very different from that which 
              we enjoy today. Generation after generation of native peoples&mdash;all
              told at least 350 generations&mdash;made their living in the region by hunting and gathering.
              Yet, this way of life was not fixed or identical for each group and each period. Researchers are only now beginning to accumulate
              enough  data to ferret out the finer changes
              and trends through time. In the next few decades, archeologists should be able to explore the details and develop
              more sophisticated understandings of the ebb and flow of human
              life over thousands of years  at Hinds Cave and
              so many other localities in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands.</p>
            <h3><a name="hunt"></a>Hunter-Gatherer Life</h3>
            <p>All of the peoples who stayed at Hinds Cave in prehistoric
              times lived off the land and followed a nomadic lifestyle known
              to anthropologists as hunting and gathering or foraging. Based
              on what is known about similar peoples elsewhere,
              the basic social group would have been an extended<strong> family band</strong>              of 10 to 25 people. Band members were closely related to one another by kinship ties,
              some genetic, some through marriage. Family bands would have consisted of some combination of grandparents,
              parents, children, aunts, uncles and cousins.</p>
            <p>Related family bands would have periodically joined together in
              larger groups of up to 100 people or more on social occasions that
              coincided with seasons of abundance, such as the late summer/early
              fall ripening of prickly pear tunas, persimmons, and walnuts. Family
              bands were related to one another through kinship, shared history,
              and language. Anthropologists sometimes call these larger groups
              macrobands. Each group, large and small, would have had its own identity, traditional
              territory, and unique name, which we&#8212;thousands of years later&#8212;will never know. Only individual family bands would
              have occupied Hinds Cave, but the cave may have been used by several
              different family bands who shared partially overlapping territories.</p>
            <p><strong>Hunter-gatherer life is highly mobile</strong>, especially in environmentally challenging
              areas such as the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. People
              could not live in one spot for long without exhausting the local supplies
              of food and firewood. Instead they must have moved their camps
              quite regularly&mdash;every few days or weeks&mdash;to take advantage
              of the resources changing with the seasons and during  short-term climatic events. Part of the mobility was tied to <strong>seasonal rounds</strong>&mdash;moving across the landscape to areas
              where different food resources could be found in abundance certain
              times of the year. For instance, native pecan
              trees grew in the deep sediments of the  terraces along the
              Devils River  and other rivers and streams farther east that drain the Edwards Plateau. Pecan nuts ripen
              in the fall and are much more abundant in some years than others.
              Hunter-gatherers would have monitored the natural crop and planned
              for particularly good harvests months in advance. When the season
              came, groups would have moved camp to the prime areas.</p>
            <p>But the changing seasons only tell part of the mobile lifestyle
              story. <strong>In the arid Lower Pecos Canyonlands, climatic events can
              be extremely localized</strong> and must have triggered movements
              of people just as they do  the movement of certain animals today. As area ranchers
              know only too well, warm-season thunderstorms often fall in only
              small areas or narrow swaths in this country. When one spot gets
              more than its share of rain, plants bloom, shrubs and trees leaf
              out, and grasses green up and grow thickly. Deer and other mobile
              animals from miles around can move in quickly to take advantage
              of localized abundance, especially during droughts and otherwise
              tough conditions. Hunters and gatherers would been equally opportunistic. </p>
            <p>The people lived mostly outdoors in open campsites along the river
              terraces and in the uplands overlooking the canyons. The main shelter
              needed most of the year was simply shade from the intense sun.
              This was provided by constructing crude makeshift dwellings and
              ramadas (shade arbors) with pole frameworks covered with whatever materials
              were at hand: leafy branches, bundles of grass, woven mats, or
              hides. We can infer this, paradoxically, from the absence of archeological evidence of
              substantial structures and also because brush huts and ramadas were
              seen by the early Spanish explorers in the region. Similar makeshift
              structures have been documented during more-recent historic encounters
              with many native groups living comparable lifestyles in northern
              Mexico and the western United States.</p>
            <p>When substantive shelter was really needed during wet,
              cold, and extremely windy weather,  the peoples of the Lower Pecos
              Canyonlands could always seek temporary refuge in natural shelters
              such as Hinds Cave. Some archeologists think the main occupations
              of the dry rockshelters may have occurred during times of inclement
              weather. The evidence from
              Hinds Cave, however, suggests this particular shelter was used throughout
              most of the year, especially during the warm-weather months. Rather than a retreat, Hind Cave  probably  served  more often as  a convenient
              camping spot  for family bands seeking out the resources of
              the canyon and nearby landforms.</p>
            <h3><a name="use"></a>Use of Hinds Cave</h3>
            <p>We infer that Hind Cave served two principle functions during
              most of its use life in prehistoric times&mdash;as an <strong>occupational
              shelter</strong> and  as a <strong>sheltered place</strong> to keep firewood, heavy tools like manos and metates, wooden tools, and small caches of food. It was not, however,
              occupied permanently or continously throughout the year. Like other caves and
              rockshelters in the region, it was used periodically and seasonally
              by the bands whose territories included the shelter.</p>
            <p>With its large overhang and overall size Hinds Cave did afford
              ample protection from rain, although only the small alcove area
              (the actual &ldquo;cave&rdquo; part) was naturally insulated from
              cold and wind. Large rockshelters were more than mere places where
              people sometimes lived. Hind Cave and other dry shelters were also
              used for  dry storage, as  <strong>caching places</strong> for domestic equipment, ritual equipment,
              and fuel, as well as <strong>final resting places</strong> for the dead. And, of
              course, the smooth walls of many shelters and overhangs in the
              Lower Pecos were used as  natural canvases for painted scenes strongly
              linked to ritual. Hinds Cave probably served as a <strong>ritual setting</strong> from time to time, but it has particularly rough, uneven walls that seem never
              have to been painted. But it probably served all of the other functions
              mentioned above.</p>
            <p>There is no reason to think that
              Hinds Cave or any other shelter was used for all of these purposes
              at any point in time. Although the large shelters must have been
              <strong>permanent, named places on the human landscape</strong>, through the centuries
              and millennia they were used to meet many different needs. Outstanding
              shelters such as Hinds must have been well mapped into the folklore
              and mythology of the people, thereby passing on the cave&rsquo;s
              legacy to each generation.</p>
            <p>  Like virtually all of the dry shelters in the
              Lower Pecos Canyonlands, artifact collectors removed most of the
              perishable equipment and burials Hinds Cave once held. Most equipment&mdash;mats,
              basketry, rabbit nets, digging sticks, grinding stones, and the
              like was presumably stored only temporarily between uses, yet over
              time things did get left behind. Some things must have been forgotten
              or abandoned because they were no longer needed or their condition
              deteriorated beyond usefulness. There is also evidence that unrelated
              Indian peoples from the Plains moved into the region and displaced
              its traditional inhabitants during late prehistoric and early historic
              times. Such catastrophic cultural changes must have also led to
              abandoned equipment and severed traditions.</p>
            <p>We know the dry shelters were used to store equipment and house
              burials because many  items and some burials were found, documented,
              and removed by early museum expeditions and archeological excavations
              beginning in the 1930s. Minimal documentation also exists for materials
              that some private collectors have donated to museums and for some
               materials that archeologists have studied from private
              collections.</p>
            <p>Natural shelters such as Hinds Cave may also have been used to
              <strong>stockpile  firewood </strong>in anticipation of  periods of wet weather. This suspected habit would have made it possible
              to carry out cooking during extended wet periods, especially the use of earth
              ovens to bake the hearts of semi-succulants such as lechuguilla
              and sotol. Earth oven cooking requires considerable firewood and
              probably was most important during the late winter and early spring
              when few other foods were available and stored foods were gone.
              Cold, wet stretches coinciding with an annual dietary low point
              would have made efficient earth oven cooking next to impossible
              except in naturally sheltered locations.</p>
            <p><strong>Floor coverings</strong>. Because the interior of the cave remained dry even in the worst
              storm, it was very dusty. No moisture could penetrate the protected
              floor and wind erosion of the soft limestone strata from which
              the cave is formed created a fine dust layer on the natural floor.
              When the natural dust was combined with wood ash from warming and
              cooking fires, clouds of dust were created simply by walking across
              the floor. To combat this rather inhospitable condition, groups
              at different times seem to have covered  parts of the floor of the cave with layers of plant materials.
              In the Early Archaic, sizable floor sections were covered on two separate occasions with prickly pear pads
              with spines removed. At other times,
              grasses, and oak leaves were used to cover the floor, perhaps in
              hopes of holding down the dust and making the cave more livable.</p>
            <p><strong>Living space.</strong> The large size of the covered overhang provided living space 
              and enough work space for the construction of earth ovens.
              The steep slope in the front portion of the floor, however, limited
              the actual living space. Based on the available floor area of the
              relatively flat central rear portion of the shelter and a tiny
              space in the alcove, there are perhaps 65-70 square meters (700-750
              square feet) of prime space for basic habitation (sleeping, warming
              fires, and ordinary cooking fires). It is estimated that <strong>Hinds 
			  Cave was  occupied by groups of no more than  12 to 15 people</strong> 
			  at any one time. More could have crowded in during a bad storm or a 
			  special occasion, but not for long.</p>
            <p>Clues as to the organization of living space have come from excavation observations and specialized analyses. <strong>Sleeping areas</strong> near
              the back of the cave were identified by the presence of <strong>beds</strong>. These
              beds were made by digging shallow pits and lining the bottom with
              green boughs (small leafy branches). Woven mats or<em><strong> petate </strong></em>fragments,
              prickly pear pads (with spines removed), and discarded sandals
              were placed as a padded layer over the bows. Grass was used to
              fill the pit and this layer was probably covered by a sleeping
              mat when the beds were in use. These beds varied in size, depending
              on the size of the person. An adult&rsquo;s bed measured slightly
              more than three feet in length and perhaps two feet across. Why
              so small? To conserve body heat, the people who stayed at Hinds
              Cave slept in a flexed position, just like many of us do today.</p>
            <p>Extensive deposits and lenses of <strong>white ash</strong> were encountered across
              the living areas of the site. We assume some of the white ash was
              the result of warming fires allowed to burn and smolder. Placing
              warming fires in front of the sleeping area, and  heating rocks
              to generate heat would certainly help one to survive a wintry night
              in Hinds Cave.</p>
            <p><strong>Earth ovens</strong> used to bake lechuguilla, sotol, and prickly pear
              pads were constructed near the front of the north end of the cave. At least two large burned rock middens and associated
              pit ovens were present within the overhang. Other burned rock layers
              were encountered in the living area as well.  Hinds Cave has some of the  earliest  evidence for earth oven cooking yet documented 
              in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. </p>
            <p><strong>Latrine deposits</strong> were recorded on the slope along the west wall
              west of the main living area. The largest and most permanent latrine
              was found on the break of the slope at the front of the living
              area (Area B). While an occasional coprolite was recovered in the
              living area, there is little doubt that certain areas within the
              overhang, but on the edges of the main living space, were set aside
              as latrines. The Area B latrine seems to have been used repeatedly
              over a several thousand year span during the Early Archaic and
              perhaps later.</p>
            <h3><a name="attire"></a>Clothing and Attire
            </h3>
            <p>During much of the year hunting and gathering peoples living in
              arid lands have very little need for clothes. They did not have
              the same attitude about modesty that most of us do today. Adult
              men probably wore simple loin cloths of fiber or leather, and women
              wore small apron-like fringe garments or deer skin skirts 
              and little else. Deer and bison hide garments have been described
              historically for hunters and gatherers in central northern Mexico,
              but no such garments have ever been recovered in the dry shelters
              of the Lower Pecos. Children must have usually gone naked. During
              the few cold months of the year (December-February), animal hide
              coverings would have been used by all, especially rabbit fur robes.
              Rabbit skins were cut into strips and twisted around a fiber cord,
              and woven into blankets or robes. Deer and bison hides may have
              been used as well, but there was no direct evidence of this at
              Hinds Cave.</p>
            <p>Few fragments of any kind of clothing were found at Hinds Cave
              with one exception: fiber sandals. <strong>Worn-out sandals were among
              the most common fiber  artifacts</strong> recovered from the Hinds Cave
              excavations. From the dozens and dozens of sandal fragments, we
              surmise  that everyone big and little wore sandals woven of locally available plants.
              Leaves and fiber of yucca and Agave lechuguilla were the preferred
              sandal-making materials. Sandal styles changed through time and
              one manufacturing technique  replaced another with the ebb and flow of human generations.</p>
            <p>We do not know the  hair styles of the Hinds Cave occupants,
              and the styles probably varied through time. Human hair was  a valuable
              fiber used for nets and  textiles throughout the
              desert Southwest. Men and women may have used their hair to meet such needs.
              Women may have worn their hair cropped or braided, while men&rsquo;s
              style probably varied more widely, depending on the group and time
              period. Interestingly, one small wooden atifact with a  comb-like working end caked with red ochre
              was found at Hinds Cave.</p>
            <p>It is very likely some of the Hinds inhabitants   were tattooed. Tattooing
              was a way of marking social group affiliation and marital status
              among desert hunters and gatherers in southern Texas and north-central
              Mexico. In earliest historic times, face and body painting was not uncommon among native groups
              in the desert, especially when visitors were anticipated. These patterns probably represent  traditions that stretch back thousands of years. </p>
            <h3><a name="season"></a>Seasonality 
            </h3>
            <p>It is often very difficult or impossible to accurately determine the time(s) of
              year that a prehistoric archeological site was occupied, especially
               open campsites with poor preservation conditions. Fortunately,
              Hinds Cave has yielded a wealth of potential evidence of seasonality because people
              brought plant materials and foods into the cave that were available
              only during certain seasons.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The big difficulty in determining
                seasonality at Hinds is that <strong>desert plants do not respond to
              the time of year as much as they do to  rainfall.&nbsp; </strong>High annual variability in the amount and
              timing of rainfall means that plant growth is sporadic. Years can
              go by between the appearance of some species and between periods
              of abundant growth. For many plants, flowering and fruiting cycles
              can occur most anytime between early spring and late fall.&nbsp; Therefore,
              precise seasonality determinations are not always possible even
              with excellent plant preservation.&nbsp; Analysts
    must qualify their seasonality assessments with phrases like &ldquo;assuming
    average conditions.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>Under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conditions wild persimmon fruits,
      for example, become available during the late summer (July and August). When abundant
      persimmon seeds and fruit parts are recovered from the cave deposits or coprolites,
      archeologists assume that late summer is the most likely season the remains
      were deposited. Prickly pear fruits from June to September, but may last to October. Mesquite
       seed pods  ripen in August and September. Walnut and acorns ripen at the close of the warm season, from early
      to late fall.</p>
            <p> Prickly pear pads
        (technically, stems) are available  year-around and are not good seasonal indicators. The same is often said about sotol and lechuguilla, but we doubt
              this was the case. While it is true that  the leaf
              bases and &ldquo;hearts&rdquo; of mature sotol and lechuguilla
              plants can be rendered edible any time of the year, these plants
              are marginal food resources even at the best times of the year. That
              is, the amount of energy that must be expended to harvest and eat
              these plants is almost equal to the amount of energy the cooked
              plants yield. Drought stressed plants would have simply not been
              worth the trouble. Therefore, it is much more likely that these
              plants were mainly harvested during optimal conditions, just prior
              to blooming. Normally, these plants bloom in the spring, thus they
              are at their nutritional peak in late winter and early spring,
              precisely the period when most other plant and animal foods are
              scarce or unavailable.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There is another indication that Hinds Cave was sometimes used
              during this same, early spring season: the use of live oak leaves
              for flooring and possibly for bedding. Live oaks drop their leaves
              in advance of flowering and pollinating at the onset of spring
              in March.&nbsp; The large quantities of live oak leaves found in
              certain Hinds Cave deposits, strongly suggest that this was one
              season that the site was occupied.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
  Taking these factors together, the overall indications of seasonality represented
  in the preserved plant materials suggest that <strong>Hinds Cave was occupied intermittently
  at different times thoughout  the year</strong>. The strongest seasonal evidence points to   
  warmer monsoon months from April-October.&nbsp; Late winter-early spring
  (February-March) is the logical  seasonal peak of lechugilla and sotol baking, of
  which there is ample evidence. Definitive evidence
  of late fall and winter (November-February) occupation is very hard to recognize. Few  resources have seasonal peaks in those lean months when  stored foods would have been highly valued. </p>

        <td width="372" valign="top"> <h3><a name="diet"></a>Diet</h3>
            <p>Much has been learned about the diet of those who stayed in Hinds
              Cave. In fact, <strong>diet has been the major research focus </strong>of virtually all
              of the completed studies as well as that of ongoing work.
              Coprolite research has led the way, but animal bones, pollen, and
              plant remains have also been analyzed and some of the latest research
              looks at DNA obtained from Hinds Cave coprolites. A comprehensive
              synthesis of the dietary studies has not been achieved yet. The
              sheer volume of amassed information is daunting, various data gaps
              remain to be filled, and different lines of evidence don&rsquo;t
              always lead to comparable conclusions. Here we  offer a partial             overview.</p>
            <p><strong>Coprolites</strong>&mdash;dried human feces&mdash;represent an extraordinarily
              direct line of dietary evidence. When  found during excavation, they are just dry fibrous lumps that
              have little discernable smell, but each lump can tell  a day-in-the-life story
              when properly studied back in the lab.</p>
            <p><strong>More coprolites were recovered from Hinds Cave than any other
              archeological site</strong> in Texas and perhaps North America and beyond. Several hundred coprolites from Hinds Cave have
              now been studied. Each represents a dietary moment in time, the
              residue left over from meals and snacks eaten in the several days
              before the stool was passed.
              Keep in mind that only some types of food exit the digestive system
              in recognizable form. Gastric juices break down most protein and
              fat from meat and nuts as well as carbohydrates from plant foods
              into compounds that the human body readily absorbs during digestion.
              What passes on through the system is indigestible fiber and other
              resistant solid matter. </p>
            <p>The diet of Hinds Cave inhabitants was starkly different from
              our modern diets. There were no highly processed or artificial ingredients
              and nothing shipped from halfway around the globe. They ate everything
              fresh except for certain foods they could easily store as is, like
              nuts, or things they could dry and then store, such as thin slices
              of deer meat, pounded fruits, and cooked lechugilla cakes. But
              no discernable evidence of food storage was found at Hinds Cave and
              it is unlikely that hunters and gatherers had enough surplus food
              most of the year to rely on stored foods for long. Logically, stored foods
              were mainly needed to survive the winter and early spring annual
              biomass low point&mdash;the period when few plants grow and most
              animals are lean. Since the Hinds Cave peoples grew no crops and
              raised no domestic food animals, everything had to be provided
              by nature and most of it came from within walking distance of the
              site. <strong>Everything eaten was pure, 100% organic, wild plant and animal
              foods.</strong></p>
            <p>So far this sounds quite healthy&mdash;and it was&mdash;but some
              of what they ate and how they fixed it might not sound as wholesome.
              They ate essentially everything edible they could get their hands
              on and they ate many things with little or no preparation. <strong>Grab
              it and gulp</strong>, so to speak.  Yet,  no matter how healthy their diet appears in theory, in practice they must have known  periods of extreme hunger quite regularly. During prolongued droughts, the native peoples of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands would have been forced to  either move elsewhere or endure near- starvation conditions. </p>
            <p>The term &ldquo;foraging&rdquo; probably describes most of their
              food procurement strategy  more accurately than does &ldquo;hunting and gathering.&rdquo; The
              latter may conjure up an image of an orderly division of labor
              with women and children gathering plant foods fairly close to camp
              and men sallying forth on hunting expeditions to bring home game.
              This is probably fairly accurate, but in reality it  was likely far more complex.</p>
            <p>Hunters and gatherers living in  arid, ecologically marginal
              regions are opportunists first and foremost. Most of the time,
              they would have foraged off the landscape, taking  advantage of whatever food they found&#8212;lizards, rats, insects, and cactus fruits among them.</p>
            <p>Adult male hunters did target big game&mdash;<strong>deer were  the top-ranked
              locally available prey&#8212;</strong>as judged by the amount of meat represented
              by its bones. And when the hunters brought home a fat, warm-season
              deer, life was good&#8212;bellies were filled with meat, fat was rendered,
              hides scraped, and praise sung to the mighty hunter. But
              deer hunting success was likely limited: deer are wary and the
              land probably supported far fewer deer than it does today (more
              grasslands would have meant fewer browsers like deer). Killing deer with an atlatl-thrown dart is much more of a challenge than  with a high-powered rifle fitted with a telescope.</p>
            <p><strong>Plants were the dietary mainstay</strong> and women and children would have
              harvested most of the plants, especially those requiring labor-intensive
              gathering and processing such as baking plants (prickly pear, lechugilla,
              sotol, onions and other bulbs and roots). But this stereotypical
              division of labor masks much  of the food that was eaten. On daily rounds,
              anyone able and hungry would have been on the lookout for anything
              easly acquired.</p>
            <p>While deer supplied an estimated 40-50% of the total meat, the
              animal bones came from many different critters. Most of them were relatively small
              animals that  were probably trapped, snared, netted,   or knocked
              on  the head with a stick, rather than brought down with an atlatl-thrown
              dart. Rats and rabbits, for instance, were regularly
              consumed and both were probably targeted with special techniques
              (such as snaring and netting). But  just as often they were probably dispatched with a rabbit stick or digging stick or a
              convenient rock when opportunity arose. Rabbits may have been gutted,
              skinned and quickly roasted. But rabbit bones and fur were consumed
              and rats didn&rsquo;t seem to require much preparation at all.
              This suggests that  they were essentially eaten whole&mdash;fur,
              bones, and all, maybe even including guts.</p>
            <p>The evidence for this has come from  coprolites, a storehouse of information not only about the types of food eaten, but how it was prepared and even how well it was chewed. Coprolites are full of all sorts of recognizable chunks of animals
              and plants. They ate many things with very little preparation and
              not much chewing. </p>
            <p>Researchers have found that plant fibers  make up most of the volume of almost every Hinds Cave coprolite that has been studied. This
              assertion begs the obvious question: <strong>how is the volume of each
              coprolite constituent calculated?</strong> To answer this and explain how
              the constituents identified, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the
              tedious and time-consuming process of the scientific analysis of
              coprolites. Then we'll consider some of the evidence and look at the results of the first and largest study of Hinds Cave coprolites done by Glenna Williams-Dean.</p>
            <p>First the analyst &ldquo;rehydrates&rdquo; a measured portion
              (say 50%) of each coprolite under study. A solvent bath brings
              the dried lump back to life, so to speak, restoring some of its
              natural color and its characteristic aroma. Then the softened mass is
              gently separated into its constituent parts using ultrasonic vibration,
              different chemical solutions, careful prying, and then screening
              the residue through a series of nested sieves that separate the
              small parts into different size groups. These various &ldquo;fractions&rdquo; are
              then dried and painstakingly separated under a microscope into
              little piles of like things until everything is sorted. Each pile
              is then identified and weighed;  these figures are then used to calculate
              the volume of each constituent.</p>
            <p>This simplified discussion  glosses over the <strong>biggest challenge: identifying
              the piles</strong>. Each constituent group&mdash;fibers, seeds, bones, and
              so on&mdash;must be studied under a microscope, sorted into ever
              smaller piles of very similar things (a specific type of seed,
              for instance), and then compared to samples of known materials for positive
              identification. Extremely tiny constituents like pollen grains
              are studied by looking at concentrated pollen solutions through
              high-powered microscopes, sometimes including scanning electron
              microscopes (SEM). Williams-Dean was fortunate to be studying at
              Texas A&amp;M University where there are many kinds of specialists
              and  comparative collections, such as herbariums, where dried
              plants are systematically stored by species and collection locale.</p>
            <p>Out of necessity, coprolite analysts become scientific generalists
              as they learn to identify each constituent group. Sometimes they
              get help from others. Ken Lord, a  graduate student who studied the animal bones from Hinds Cave, identified those that Williams-Dean picked out of the coprolites. But some
              materials had to be sent elsewhere for identification help. For
              instance, animal hair and fur samples were sent to Alberto Vazquez,
              a specialist at the Food and Drug Administration in Washington
              D. C. Vazquez identified hairs found in Hinds Cave coprolites as
              those of rodents, muskrats, rabbits, and carnivores, including
              that of a coyote or  possibly a domesticated dog.</p>
            <p> Plant fibers are often
              hard to positively identify, but seeds are much easier. <strong>Plant seeds are  present
              in almost all coprolites (98%)</strong>. Cactus seeds of the genus Opuntia
              were present in 74% of the 100 coprolites studied by Williams-Dean
              and most of these were from several species of prickly pear as
              well as pencil cactus. Other common seeds were walnut, persimmon,
              hackberry, mesquite, yucca, grape, and sotol. The little walnut
              thrives locally in the canyons and produces very small nuts, rich
              in fat and protein. The nutmeat, however, is very difficult to
              separate from the shell. Hinds Cave inhabitants solved this problem
              by simply smashing the nuts into pieces and downing the pieces,
              fragmented nutmeat and nutshell alike.</p>
            <p>Plant skin fragments were also very numerous in the coprolites.
              Some 70% contained Opuntia skin (mainly prickly pear). The combined
              evidence of Opuntia fiber, seeds, and skin suggests that <strong>the pads
              and fruit of prickly pear cactus were a dietary mainstay</strong> and eaten
              almost every day. Another common plant in the diet was wild onion,
              38% of the coprolites contained onion skin&mdash;apparently the
              small wild onions were swallowed whole, probably after they were
              baked.</p>
            <p><strong>Animal bones were present in 97% of the examined coprolites.</strong> Some
              were very small bones, such as those of tiny fish and lizards,
              but many were sizable. Williams-Dean found  a squirrel femur
              (leg bone) that was 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) long. Rodent bones
              were the most common (66%), followed by rabbit bones (20%) and
              bird bones (12%). The most common rodents in the diet were wood
              rats and cotton rats, small by street rat standards, but bigger
              than mice. As proof that rodents were often eaten essentially whole,
              consider the fact that 47% of the coprolites contained rodent cranial
              fragments (skull, jaw, or teeth). </p>
            <p>The bones in the coprolites are mainly those of relatively small
              species that could be eaten whole or in big chunks, bones and all.
              Meat from larger animals appears to have been cooked first and
              then stripped from the bone before eating. We know this because
              many animal bones were found within the Hinds Cave deposits. Ken
              Lord&rsquo;s study of almost 25,000 animal bones from the site
              provides us a different look at the animals they ate.</p>
            <p>Lord studied the bones recovered through the normal course excavation.
              Most came from coarse screening fraction captured on 1/4&rdquo; mesh
              screen, the standard recovery method used in most excavations at
              Hinds Cave. In Blocks A and B, however, the soil was also passed
              through fine screens, the smallest being 1/16th-inch mesh screen.
              This fine screen fraction yielded small bones and bone fragments.
              Lord chose samples from layers assigned to each of the occupation
              periods discernable in the Hinds Cave deposits. </p>
            <p>As an example, let's 
                review the bones from Analytical Unit 7 the thickest and most extensive
                stratigraphic unit sampled at Hinds Cave. From this unit, Lord studied 9,046 bones and used standard techniques
              to calculate the minimum number of individuals (MNI). In this case
              there were an estimated 428 individual animals. Of these, over
              half were rodents (58.2%) followed by rabbits (16%), birds (11.4%),
              carnivores (6.8%), reptiles (4.4%), deer (1.6%) and fish (1.4%).
              But it would take hundreds of rodents to equal the meat represented
              by a single deer. So Lord also calculated the useable meat weight
              represented by each individual animal. Now the patterns start to
              make more sense. Deer bones account for only 1.6% of the
              individual animals, but translated to food value, <strong>deer provided  an estimated 42% of the meat  consumed at Hinds Cave</strong>. Small to medium-sized carnivores (such as coyote/dog, gray fox, and ringtail cat) represent
              another 29.6 % of the meat followed by rabbit (10.1%), rodents
              (9.8%), birds (4.4%), fish (2.3%), and reptiles (1.5%).</p>
            <p>Similar kinds of calculations and details are available for the
              bones and coprolites from later deposits in Hinds Cave, and other
              kinds of studies from different lines of evidence add even more
              dietary inferences. For instance, Phil Dering has studied the site&rsquo;s
              plant macrofossils, meaning the plant remains that are visible
              to the unaided human eye as chunks of fiber, seeds, leaves, and
              so on. Summarizing and synthesizing all of the evidence would probably merit a thick scholarly
              volume. So we will conclude this section with a quick sketch of
              the Hinds Cave diet about 7,000 years ago (5,000 B.C.).</p>
            <p>The Hinds Cave diet 7,000 years ago was based on a broad spectrum
              of locally available plants and animals that changed from season
              to season and sometimes even day to day. They ate what was available
              and what they could find. Among the plants, the prickly pear cactus
              stands out as one of the mainstay plants but dozens of other plants
              were consumed. Some such as seeds, nuts, and fruit were eaten raw; others, especially
              the carbohydrate-rich plants, had to be baked for several days. Although the largest
              share of the meat and animal fat came from deer and small carnivores,
              rabbits and rats were easier to come by and eaten much more frequently.</p>
            <p>In sum, the people who frequented Hinds Cave during the Early
              Archaic period (and later) exemplify the hunting and gathering
              way of life. <strong>Their lives may have been physically demanding and their diets
              rough, but they were healthy, physically fit, never obese, and
              probably quite content to be living a lifestyle that is unfamiliar
              to us today. </strong>We consider ourselves &ldquo;modern,&rdquo; &ldquo;civilized,&rdquo; and &ldquo;technologically
              advanced,&rdquo; but perhaps the &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; life at
              Hinds Cave 7,000 years ago wasn&rsquo;t so inferior. Just different,
              very different. </p></td>
