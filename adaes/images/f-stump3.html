    <h2>Stump 3 
    </h2>
    <table width="780" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="480" valign="top">
	<p>The excavation of Stump 3 illustrates how archeologists took advantage of a natural calamity and storm-wrought damage to the site.  This tree grew in the southern part of the presidio enclosure between the south palisade and several barrack buildings shown on the Urrutia map.  Examination of the stump block showed intact layering and rich midden deposits probably representing refuse discarded through time as the barracks were cleaned out.  Avery excavated the large stump block  much like archeologists normally excavate test pits. But this was essentially an inverted excavation block with the great advantage that Avery was able to clean and examine the wall profiles of the block before he excavated it.  </p>
<p>A severe storm knocked down over 100 trees at Los Adaes in 1993.&nbsp; Trees that were less than 50 cm snapped off  above the ground, but trees that were greater than 50 cm in diameter did not  break, but rather uprooted, and depending on the size of the tree, caused  damage to the archeological deposits.&nbsp;  Only the stumps of these trees remained in 1995 when Avery started as  Station Archeologist. </p>
<p>Under his direction, each of the stumps was numbered, and plans made for excavation of many of them.&nbsp;It was decided to leave the  stumps inside and adjacent to the presidio and to excavate them when school  groups would visit so that the students could see an excavation in  progress.&nbsp; Students also could water screen  deposits that had been excavated. The teachers asked the students to &ldquo;dress to  get dirty,&rdquo; and the water screening station proved to be a favorite among the  students.&nbsp; Most of the disturbed area of  Stump 3 was excavated over a three-year period.</p>
<p>

  Stump 3 covered a large area, so it was excavated in 1-x-1 meter units.&nbsp; Three zones were observed.&nbsp; Zone 1 was a silty loam with few artifacts  and appeared to be topsoil that had built up around the tree.&nbsp; Zone 2a was dark yellow brown sand and also  contained few artifacts.&nbsp; Zone 2b was  yellowish red silty clay with a high density of artifacts. &nbsp;Albisola  lead-glazed redware (made in Italy),  which dates post-1750, was recovered from Zones 1 and 2a, but not from Zone  2b.&nbsp; Similiarly, Rouen Polychrome, which dates  post-1770, has been recovered in Zones 1 and 2a, but not from Zone 2b of the  Stump 3 excavations units.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the layered deposits formed over the life of the presidio, with the lowest zone  forming before 1750. </p>
<p> Large quantities of  Native American pottery  and bone fragments from large mammals&mdash;probably mostly cattle&mdash;were the dominant  artifacts, but Spanish, French, Asian, and German pottery sherds were  recovered, along with iron nails, silver amulets, and other unidentified metal  artifacts.&nbsp; All the artifacts were small  fragments, which suggested that they had been dumped on the ground surface and  walked on.&nbsp; Larger fragments of artifacts  are found in trash pits because no animals or people walk on the trash when it  is dumped in a pit.&nbsp; No postmolds were  observed.&nbsp; Sometimes the rotten roots  from the tree gave the appearance of postmolds, but when these areas were  excavated, it was clear that they were areas where roots had rotted in place  and gave the soil a dark color. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pottery sherds recovered from Stump 3 (mostly from Zone  2b) included 896  Native American sherds, 31 majolica sherds, 29 faience sherds,  5 British or Dutch tin-enameled sherds, 6 Asian porcelain sherds, 2 Italian  lead-glazed sherds, and 2 German stoneware sherds.&nbsp; Most of the Stump 3  Native American pottery sherds have plain  surface treatment, with 85% plain, 12% incised, 1.5% engraved, and 1.5%  punctated.&nbsp; The surface treatment and temper analysis revealed no significant  variation in surface treatment between zones, but there was variation in temper  between the zones.&nbsp; Over all, there is an  increase in the percentage of shell over bone temper from the lower to the  upper zones.&nbsp; A total of 6,169 animal bone  fragments were recovered&mdash;the great majority of these were too small to identify  what type of animal they were, and about half of the bone fragments were  burned.&nbsp; A total of 323 fragments of 18th-century glass was recovered&mdash;most appeared to be bottle glass.&nbsp;  Beads  recovered from  Stump 3 excavations numbered 600 &mdash;most of these are less than 4 millimeters in diameter  and are called &ldquo;seed&rdquo; beads because of their small size.&nbsp; Metal artifacts were not great in quantity,  but included iron nails, thimbles, lead spillage (probably from making round  bullets, or ball shot), gunflint fragments, and flint chips probably from  trimming gunflints.</p>
<p>  Stump 3 is located in the area of the barracks inside the presidio.&nbsp; It is to be expected that there would be some  artifacts discarded within the presidio, but the large numbers of artifacts in  Zone 2b&mdash;particularly the large amount of animal bone&mdash;suggests that this trash  deposit was taken from a dump area located nearby.&nbsp; The following interpretation of the Stump 3  deposits is a combination of what is known from the historical documents and  what was observed from the archeological excavations.</p>
<p>  It is hypothesized  that Stump 3 is in an area  where a foundation was prepared for a barracks building that may never have  been built.&nbsp; Zone 2a may represent a  sandy cap laid over a deposit of silty clay mixed with trash (Zone 2b) which  was deposited to create a level surface on the sloping interior of the  presidio.&nbsp; The Zone 2b fill is a mixture  of sand, clay, and artifacts.&nbsp; As such,  it forms a stable base for the structure.&nbsp;  Roadbed construction in areas poor in rock will often employ a mixture  of sand and clay to serve as a base for the road.&nbsp; But the mixture is a fairly precise  combination&mdash;too much sand will cause the base to crumble, and too little sand  will result in damaging shrinking and swelling with exposure to moisture.&nbsp; The right combination of sand, clay, and  other aplastics&mdash;such as midden artifacts&mdash;will result in a stable  foundation.&nbsp; In much the same way as  adding temper to clay for pottery making reduces shrinkage, so too would the  presence of midden artifacts reduce the harmful effects of shrinkage.</p>
<p>The documents indicate that Governor Winthuisen  arrived at Los Adaes in 1741 and proceeded to build seven new barracks and  platforms for two other barracks to be constructed later.&nbsp; It is interesting  that only five barracks are depicted on the 1767 Urrutia map.&nbsp; The Stump 3 area may represent a foundation  platform prepared for a barracks that was never constructed, or it may be one  of the seven barracks buildings built by Winthuisen that was demolished sometime  before 1767.&nbsp; In either case, a level  foundation surface was required.&nbsp; This  surface was created with a mixture of clay, sand, and garbage&mdash;possibly from the  nearby defensive ditch that may have been used as a dump, given the lack of any  serious military threat from either the French or the Caddo peoples.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Given this scenario, the clay/sand/garbage  fill zone of Stump 3&mdash;Zone 2b&mdash;would consist of pre-1741 material.&nbsp; So far, no artifacts dating after 1741 have  been identified in Zone 2b.&nbsp; Also, the small  size of all artifacts and the fact that much of the bone fragments were burned,  supports that the artifacts were dumped in the area, burned, and then subjected to  foot traffic&mdash;by either humans or domesticated animals.&nbsp; This would be the case in garbage being  dumped and burned in the <em>fosa</em>, or  defensive ditch just outside the presidio wall.&nbsp;  For such a ditch to be an effective deterrent to an armed assault, its  depth would have to be maintained.&nbsp; Governor  Winthuisen may have ordered the cleaning of the ditch, and the mixing of clay  with the trash removed from the ditch to serve as foundations for the new  barracks may have been a by-product of the overall improvement effort at the  presidio.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  The Stump 3, Zone 2b material appears to  represent a wide variety of activities within the presidio prior to 1741.&nbsp; Los Adaes was a military installation, but  exclusively military artifacts were not recovered from the Stump 3 units.&nbsp; The activities of metalworking, bullet  making, and gunflint trimming are indicated by slag, lead splatter, and lithic  chipping debris.&nbsp; However, these  activities can be both for military and non-military purposes.&nbsp; Subsistence-related artifacts dominate the  assemblage.&nbsp; Faunal remains and Native  American pottery fragments are by far the most abundant artifacts recovered  from the Stump 3 units.&nbsp; Almost all the  faunal material is large domesticated mammal&mdash;no fish are in the sample.&nbsp; Pottery fragments, representing food  transportation, storage, and consumption, are primarily Native American.&nbsp; The roughly equal amounts of Spanish and  non-Spanish ceramics fit the overall pattern for Los Adaes.</p></td>
