			  <!-- #BeginEditable "caption" -->This pommel once graced the front arch of a western style saddle and is said to have been found at Los Adaes by an artifact collector years ago.  Both the front and back sides are shown.  It has not been analyzed by Los Adaes metal expert Jay Blaine, but he believes it is likely to be made of brass coated with a gold fire gild or wash.  This technique was commonly used on 18th-century watch plates and can maintain a very bright and durable finish for hundreds of years.  The pommel bears the inscription –CASTILLAIE LA.” One is tempted to guess that Castillaie could represent the former ownerês name and LA could stand for Los Adaes.  Regardless, this is a fancy piece of horse gear of the sort that only a high ranking Spanish officer is likely to have been able to afford.  The artifact is at Louisiana State University. <!-- #EndEditable -->
