In the 1690s, Father Hidalgo had been in charge of failed Spanish missions to the Tejas Indians (Hasinai Caddo) in east Texas, and he was having trouble getting the Spanish to support his return.  It was not until 1713 when his letter reached the newly appointed French Governor, Antoine de La Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac. Governor Cadillac told Canadian-born adventurer Louis Juchereau de St. Denis to go find Father Hidalgo, a seminal event that led to the establishment of Los Adaes. .</p></td>

    		  (see <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/gateway/index.html" target="_blank">Gateway Missions</a> exhibit), a Spanish presidio and mission on the Rio Grande, hoping to set up overland trade connections.  Spanish Captain Diego Ramon arrests St. Denis and holds him for over a year, but the two become friends.  In late 1715 or early 1716 St. Denis married Mar&iacute;a Manuela Sanchez de Navarro, Diego Ramon's step-granddaughter.  This kinship bond between French and Spanish citizens would become a familiar pattern in Los Adaes history.</p></td>

Mission Los Adaes lay within the territory of the Adaes Indians, a relatively small group who lived between the Red River and the Sabine River in what is today northwestern Louisiana.

The French arrived unexpectedly and quickly captured the only Spanish soldier then present and began confiscating livestock and articles from the mission.  Flapping chickens caused the French Lieutenant in charge of the raid to be thrown from his horse, allowing the lone Spanish lay brother then at the mission to escape and make his way to Mission Dolores.  The news of the attack (and the war in Europe) cause the Spanish in east Texas to again abandon their east Texas missions and Presidio Dolores and retreat to San Antonio de B&eacute;xar. </p></td>

Aguayo leaves behind a contingent of 100 soldiers, 31 of whom were accompanied by their families.  </p>
    		  <p>Over the next few years the soldiers build <strong>Presidio Nuestra Se<ETH>ora del Pilar de los Adaes</strong> to safeguard the mission and defend the province from the nearby French.  Lacking building stone, the presidio and mission are built of pine and hardwood timber, materials that deteriorate rapidly in humid conditions.  Decay, repair, and rebuilding were to be constant features throughout the history of Los Adaes.</p></td>

    		<td><p> For sustenance the Spanish soldier-settlers and the missionaries at Los Adaes depend on supplies brought overland on horse and mules from New Spain.  The Adaese&ntilde;os, as the inhabitants of Los Adaes came to be known, are joyous at the arrival of maize, wheat flour, and cattle and sheep sent by Governor Aguayo in the fall of 1721, an event that historian Robert Weddle  described as "the forerunner of the cattle drives which were to play such an important role in the later history of Texas."  But Spanish supply convoys and livestock drives are few and far between, often delayed for weeks and months by flooding along the many rivers and major streams draining the coastal plain of Texas. The Adaese&ntilde;os have to provide for themselves by farming and ranching.  Repeated attempts to grow maize are met with only modest and irregular success, owing to the area's propensity for periods of excessive rain as well as summer drought.  They fare far better at raising livestock.<br>
    		    <br>

To survive at Los Adaes the Spanish soon find themselves dependent on the French at nearby Natchitoches for food and supplies that they could otherwise obtain only sporadically.   The Spanish have livestock and the services of their Catholic priests to offer the French.  Although most trade with the French is officially prohibited, it is required for survival.  Spanish authorities in New Spain periodically give the Adaese&ntilde;os permission to trade for food, but illicit trade for food and other commodities become part and parcel of life at Los Adaes.
