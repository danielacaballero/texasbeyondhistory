                  <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text">The Gault site, midway between Georgetown and 
                    Ft. Hood in central Texas, has a long history of archeological 
                    investigation as well as uncontrolled artifact digging. Located 
                    in a small wooded valley with a spring-fed creek and an unlimited 
                    supply of excellent flint, the site was occupied intensively 
                    during all major periods of the prehistoric era. James E. 
                    Pearce, the first professional archeologist in Texas, learned 
                    of the Gault Farm site and excavated there in 1929-1930. Over 
                    the next 60 years, artifact collectors churned up the upper 
                    deposits over almost the entire site, but stopped digging 
                    when the dark rich midden soil played out. In 1990, an artifact 
                    collector dug deeper and found Clovis artifacts along with 
                    several unusual incised stones, something never before found 
                    with Clovis materials. Learning of the find, Drs. Thomas R. 
                    Hester and Michael B. Collins of the Texas Archeological Research 
                    Laboratory carried out testing at Gault in 1991, just enough 
                    to confirm the collector's story. But the property owner at 
                    the time continued to let pay-to-dig artifact collectors destroy 
                    the site. </p>
                  <p class="text">Fortunately for archeology, the property changed 
                    hands and the new owners recognized the scientific importance 
                    of the site. Since 1998 a major excavation project has been 
                    underway at Gault, led by Collins. The work has been carried 
                    out by a cast of hundreds of individuals representing dozens 
                    of organizations. A relatively small core of professional 
                    staff works with university field schools from Texas A&amp;M, 
                    UT Austin, and Brigham Young University as well as volunteers 
                    from near and far including many members of the Texas Archeological 
                    Society. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Gault site is attracting national and international 
                    attention because of the wealth of new information on Clovis 
                    culture that is emerging from right here in the heart of Texas. 
                    In <a href="clovis.html" class="text">Clovis 
                    Reconsidered</a> you will learn about the unfolding interpretations 
                    of what Clovis life was like 13,000 years ago at the Gault 
                    site and how these ideas are helping to mold a dramatically 
                    new view of the peopling of the Americas. You can also look through the <a href="tas.html" class="text">TAS
