                  <p class="text">For most students of archeology, &quot;Clovis&quot; 
                    conjures up a vision of a distinctive spear point like the 
                    one shown on the left and of small groups of &quot;big game&quot; 
                    hunters killing Ice-Age elephants as they migrated across 
                    North America. For over five decades the <i>Clovis-first hypothesis</i>&#151;the 
                    idea that Clovis hunters were the first people to explore 
                    the New World&#151;has been a fundamental part of the story 
                    of the peopling of the Americas. Clovis peoples with their 
                    remarkably sophisticated hunting technology were seen as the 
                    first pioneers, highly mobile hunters who walked to North 
                    America via the Bering Land Bridge. Once below the Ice Sheet, 
                    small groups of Clovis hunters and their families expanded 
                    rapidly across the continent killing mammoths so effectively 
                    that the species was pushed over the brink of extinction. 
                    Or so the standard story goes. </p>
                  <p class="text">In the past decade, the Clovis-first hypothesis 
                    has come under attack from many directions. There have been 
                    multiple claims of earlier, pre-Clovis sites in North and 
                    South America, none totally accepted, but several very credible. 
                    And then there are the early skeletal remains found in North 
                    America, such as the controversial Kennewick Man, whose features 
                    are said to more closely resemble certain Caucasian populations 
                    than later Native Americans. Adding to this, some stone tool 
                    experts have made a case for a close resemblance between Clovis 
                    technology and that of Late Paleolithic Europe. In the last 
                    few years these claims, pro and con, have been reviewed in 
                    <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>National 
                    Geographic</i> and on the <i>Discovery Channel</i>, among 
                    others.</p>
                  <p class="text">Meanwhile at the Gault site deep in the heart 
                    of central Texas, Clovis culture is being reconsidered week 
                    by week, midway through a planned five-year dig. The emerging 
                    view hardly resembles the Clovis story known to generations 
                    of archeology students. Instead of a new group of people exploring 
                    an unknown land, we seem to see a people thoroughly familiar 
                    with their surroundings. Instead of highly mobile elephant 
                    hunters, we see what looks like a full-blown generalized hunting 
                    and gathering culture living in the same kind of places and 
                    doing many of the same kinds of things that characterized 
                    Archaic-era life all across the continent a few thousand years 
                    later. This is more than a new spin, this is a whole new way 
                    of thinking about what is still, to many, America's earliest 
                    recognizable culture.</p>
                  <p class="text">The evidence presented here  
                    is so new that most of it has yet to be reported, at least 
                    not in a proper scientific sense. Research at Gault 
                    site continues as does laboratory research and reporting. Several of the nation's leading Paleoindian 
                    experts and specialists in various subfields and dozens of 
                    their undergraduate and graduate students are working on different 
                    aspects of the site. In other words, what follows is merely 
                    a glimpse of what is to come, a peek behind the scenes and 
                    into the head of Dr. Michael B. Collins, the lead researcher 
                    who heads up the project. This is what he now (2001) thinks Clovis 
                    life may have been like based on the emerging evidence. Like 
                    any good scientist, he reserves the right to change his mind. 
                    Collins fully expects the next few years will bring even more 
                    surprises at Gault and elsewhere that will help paint a more 
                    complete and accurate picture of the Clovis past. </p>
                  <p class="text">Born and raised in Texas, Collins knew in high 
                    school that he wanted to become an archeologist (see &quot;<a href="../bonfire/investigations.html" class="text">A 
                    High School Student Discovers Bone</a>&quot;). The Gault Project 
                    brings together the three principal themes of his career: 
                    lithics, early Paleoindians, and geoarcheology. His interest 
                    in the early peoples of the New World started when he first 
                    found Paleoindian artifacts around the playa lakes near Midland, 
                    Texas, while still a teenager. He studied archeology and geology 
                    at the University of Texas and then went on to get a Ph.D. 
                    from the University of Arizona. As a stone tool expert he 
                    is well known for his work with Tom Dillehay on the extremely 
                    early Monte Verde site in Chile as well as a recent book, 
                    <i>Clovis Blade Technology</i> (1999, UT Press). His interest 
                    in geoarcheology, the marriage of archeology and geology, 
                    developed as a natural outcome of his interest in Paleondian 
                    cultures. Collins has worked on archeological projects in 
                    many states, countries, and continents, none (with the possible 
                    exception of Monte Verde) more exciting or important than 
                    the Gault site. Being able to investigate a world-class archeological 
                    site less than an hour's drive from either his Austin home 
                    or his Williamson County farm is a dream come true for &quot;Dr. 
                    Clovis.&quot;</p>
                  <h3>Ecotones and Endless Flint</h3>
                  <p class="text">To understand why Clovis peoples repeatedly 
                    came to Gault and apparently stayed for quite some time, you 
                    first have to know where it is and what it had to offer. The 
                    Gault site is located in central Texas about 40 miles north 
                    of Austin, halfway between Georgetown and Killeen (Ft. Hood). 
                    It sits near the head of a small creek in a small wooded valley 
                    just at the point where a number of springs  come together 
                    to form a clear, cool vigorous stream that has never gone 
                    dry in historic times. This valley is one of many that cut 
                    through the eastern flank of the vast limestone Edwards Plateau 
                    that stretches far to the south and west. The Gault site is 
                    in the northern part of the Texas Hill Country within the 
                    Lampasas Cut Plain, where, as its name implies, the limestone 
                    plateau is somewhat flatter and &quot;cut&quot; by many incised 
                    stream valleys. </p>
                  <p class="text">A three-hour walk down the creek valley, the 
                    limestone country ends abruptly at the Balcones Escarpment 
                    and the Black Prairie begins. This geological fault zone is 
                    one of the most impressive ecotones in North America, places 
                    where different environments come in contact. Moving east 
                    along the creek, almost everything changes in just a few miles&#151;geology, 
                    hydrology, soils, plants, and animals. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Black Prairie, so named for its rich black 
                    &quot;gumbo&quot; clay soil, was a grassland for at least 
                    the last 15,000 years and still would be today if the grazing, 
                    fire control, agriculture, and concrete had not all but spelled 
                    its doom. Spanish explorers in the early seventeenth century 
                    rode their horses through grass so thick and deep in many 
                    places that only the mounted riders could see where they were 
                    going. They found plenty of buffalo and antelope to hunt on 
                    the Black Prairie but when they turned west and entered the 
                    rugged up and down world of the Texas Hill Country, they had 
                    to rely on deer and turkey. They found dense, towering bands 
                    of hardwood forest along the streams and an oak savannah in 
                    the uplands with mixed grasses and trees, many of them stunted 
                    and confined to mottes by periodic range fires.</p>
                  <p class="text">Moving from the grand scale to the local, the 
                    Gault site itself sits on a smaller scale ecotone that is 
                    still obvious today even to the casual visitor. The road to 
                    the site leads through the typical rocky limestone rolling 
                    hills with very little soil and lots of cedar (juniper), live 
                    oak, mesquite and prickly pear. As you approach the site, 
                    the road drops off into the valley&#151;only about 45 feet 
                    lower, but what a difference. The deep, well-watered soils 
                    provide habitat for huge hardwood trees&#151;burr oaks, walnuts, 
                    pecans, ash, elm, bois d' arc, and a dozen more species including 
                    willow and cottonwood. In a word, it is lush. While we don't 
                    have an accurate idea of what the local vegetation was like 
                    in Clovis times, the contrast between valley bottom and the 
                    surrounding uplands would have been just as stark.</p>
                  <p class="text">So the Gault site was located on ecotones, large 
                    and small, in a small, protected wooded valley with a spring-fed 
                    stream. But it had one other important thing going for it&#151;a 
                    nearly inexhaustible supply of extremely high quality flint 
                    (chert). The flint occurs as stream-worn cobbles along the 
                    creek and it weathers out of the bedrock along the valley 
                    slopes and in the uplands surrounding the site. For over 13,000 
                    years people have been picking up flint here and yet modern 
                    flintknappers have hauled away pickup loads of it. And still 
                    you cannot walk 10 feet without seeing pieces of flint. Some 
                    of the larger nodules are the size of a fat watermelon. </p>
                  <h3>They Came To Stay</h3>
                  <p class="text">Most known Clovis sites fall into one of four 
                    categories. By far the most numerous are places where isolated 
                    finds of Clovis points are made. The next most common are 
                    kill sites, places like Lehner and Murray Springs in southeastern 
                    Arizona or Domebo in south-central Oklahoma where elephant 
                    bones and Clovis artifacts were found together. And then there 
                    are Clovis caches, isolated places were Clovis points, bifaces, 
                    blades, or blade cores are found in tight piles thought to 
                    represent hidden stashes. Finally, there is the rarest category, 
                    camps&#151;places where Clovis peoples stayed put long enough 
                    for considerable debris to build up. Some camps occur in rockshelters 
                    and others in open settings, but most known Clovis camps appear 
                    to be the result of fairly brief stays. In contrast, the Gault 
                    site is clearly a major base camp, a place where people returned 
                    repeatedly and probably stayed for lengthy periods of time.</p>
                  <p class="text">How do we know? Well for one thing it is a very 
                    large site. Imagine a football field. Now add a second one 
                    beside it. Now add two more pairs of fields end to end. And 
                    this is only the core area of the site measuring about 80 
                    by 300 yards where Clovis materials are known to be concentrated. 
                    The entire Gault site covers an area about 90-100 yards wide 
                    by about 650 yards long. Not all of this area has been tested 
                    yet, but enough to get a fairly good idea of what lies beneath 
                    the surface. The evidence is not spread uniformly; some areas 
                    have much greater artifact densities than others. And it is 
                    also clear that some of the deposits have been washed away 
                    by floods&#151;concentrations of Clovis artifacts have been 
                    found within gravel deposits along the creek. It is not just 
                    large, but incredibly rich. The Clovis deposits average about 
                    40 centimeters (16 inches) thick but are sometimes twice that 
                    or more, and in places the deposits contain unbelievably large 
                    numbers of Clovis artifacts. Collins guesses that the Gault 
                    site may have already yielded as much as 60% of all excavated 
                    Clovis artifacts known today.</p>
                  <p class="text">Base camps, as the name implies, are places 
                    where people stayed for a while and ventured out from, repeatedly. 
                    One characteristic they have is &quot;assemblage diversity&quot;&#151;lots 
                    of different kinds of artifacts. The diversity already recognized 
                    at Gault is astonishing. There are many Clovis points&#151;finished 
                    points, worn out points, half-made points, resharpened points, 
                    and lots of fragments. And Clovis bifaces&#151;big heavy bifaces, 
                    small thin bifaces, bifaces broken in manufacture, and several 
                    kinds of specialized bifaces. There are also hundreds of Clovis blade 
                    cores and blades&#151;large ones, small 
                    ones, crested outer blades, thin inner blades, broken blades, 
                    and used blades. And then there are the blade tools&#151;end scrapers 
                    made on blades, serrated blades, blades with sharp graver-like 
                    beaks, and blades with incredible use-wear traces. The finding 
                    of several adzes or wood-working tools was quite unusual&#151;this 
                    tool form was not known previously from other Clovis sites, 
                    although it occurs more commonly at later sites. Another interesting artifact from Gault is a bone or ivory rod, found in the ancient 
                    gravel deposits of the creek amid definite Clovis artifacts. 
                    It is very similar to specimens found in other Clovis sites.                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Among the unprecedented  finds at Gault are  the incised stones&#151;smallish, 
                    smooth limestone rocks and chert (flint) flakes that have various patterns and designs 
                    formed by shallow lines almost certainly made with sharp flint 
                    flakes. More than 100 of these &quot;mobile art&quot; objects 
                    are known from Gault, from early Paleoindian contexts as well as later Archaic-age deposits. The Clovis-age specimens may represent the earliest examples 
                    of representational art in North America. </p>
                  <p class="text">The artifact diversity obviously means that 
                    many different tasks were carried out at the site and probably 
                    elsewhere by work parties who returned to Gault. The Gault 
                    researchers are not ready to enumerate these tasks in much 
                    detail, but some patterns are already clear. First and perhaps 
                    foremost, the Gault site was a major tool-making locality&#151;a 
                    lithic workshop where a great many stone tools were made, 
                    most out of flint. All stages of tool-making were carried 
                    out from the first stages of &quot;primary reduction&quot; 
                    (breaking up large cobbles into usable pieces) to the final 
                    stages of putting the finishing touches on a completed artifact. 
                    And beyond&#151;there are many resharpened and broken tools 
                    at Gault that show people were &quot;retooling&quot;&#151;taking 
                    the time to replace broken and worn parts (such as the tips 
                    of spears) with sharp new ones. While evidence is less direct, 
                    a great deal of wood working, binding, and so on must have 
                    taken place there as well. Tiny gravers&#151;very small, delicate 
                    stone tools with sharp beaks&#151;hint at some sort of specialized 
                    work&#151;scarifying (scratching the skin to draw blood or 
                    allow tattoo pigment to absorb) or incising bone, wood, or stone?</p>
                  <p class="text">Although bone preservation is generally poor 
                    in the Clovis deposits, there are enough bones of mammoth, 
                    horse, and bison to suggest that these animals were killed 
                    not too far away and at least partially butchered at the site. 
                    Many tools speak to hunting and butchering&#151;Clovis points, 
                    bifaces and sharp blades with meat polish, and heavy choppers 
                    probably used to dismember large animals. Endscrapers made 
                    on blades suggest that hide working was another typical activity. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">One of the most promising avenues for documenting 
                    the daily activities of the Clovis peoples who stayed at Gault 
                    is through use-wear analysis of stone tools. Using this approach, 
                    Gault staff researcher Marilyn Shoberg has already identified 
                    three very different tasks that Clovis blades were used for: 
                    butchering, grass-cutting, and woodworking. She looks at individual stone 
                    tools under 200x magnification using a binocular microscope 
                    with polarized light and special eye pieces designed just 
                    for this kind of work. At 200x, the edge of a Clovis blade 
                    looks like an alien world complete with craters and mountains. 
                    These micro-topographic features are the actual surface of 
                    the stone tool.</p>
                  <p class="text">When stone tools are used repeatedly, once-sharp 
                    edges become dull and rounded and polish forms. Different 
                    kinds of contact materials create different kinds of polish&#151;high 
                    polish, dull polish, domed polish and more. And when hard 
                    particles, such as sand grains adhering to a hunk of mammoth, 
                    come into contact with the polished edges, they leave striations&#151;scratches 
                    and gouges. The orientation of these blemishes tells Shoberg 
                    which direction the tool was being pulled (or pushed).</p>
                  <p class="text">The patterns seen on archeological specimens 
                    must be compared to experimental tools used for known purposes 
                    on known materials. These serve as control or reference samples.</p>

                  <p class="text">The picture above is the surface of a serrated 
                    Clovis blade. The shiny polish is the kind that is associated 
                    with cutting meat&#151;butchering. Notice the criss-crossed 
                    striations. The triangular pattern left by the intersection 
                    of the striations is very characteristic of a tool used repeatedly 
                    to cut the meat of a large animal. The different striation 
                    directions imply that the blade was held in different ways 
                    or at least at different angles.</p>
                  <p class="text">Now compare this with the first picture on the 
                    right showing the magnified edge of a Clovis blade with obvious 
                    polish. Notice that most of the surface is completely smooth 
                    and the edge heavily rounded. The polish is continuous, smooth, 
                    and has numerous small pits and medium-sized comet-shaped 
                    pits. This kind of polish is consistent with use in processing 
                    plant material high in silicates, and is often referred to 
                    as &quot;sickle gloss.&quot; The edge (at the bottom of the 
                    picture) is heavily rounded, which means that this tool was 
                    used for quite some time.</p>
                  <p class="text">Finally, compare the first two photos with the 
                    second (lower) picture on the right showing the magnified 
                    edge of an experimental blade used to cut Little Bluestem 
                    grass, the kind that formerly covered much of the Black Prairie. 
                    After 2000 strokes, characteristic silica polish is just forming 
                    in a continuous band along the edge of the blade, and pockmarked 
                    areas of polish extend back from the edge. The areas of polish 
                    are not as large and continuous on the experimental blade 
                    when compared to that on the archeological tool, suggesting 
                    that the experimenters have many more thousand strokes to 
                    put in. But the characteristic form of the polish on the replica 
                    tool, with small pits and linear features parallel to the 
                    edge of the blade, is very similar to that found on the archeological 
                    tool. This comparison supports the hypothesis that the prehistoric 
                    blade was used to harvest and/or process grass or reeds.</p>
                  <p class="text">Shoberg has just begun to look at the Clovis 
                    tools from Gault. She and other researchers will spend hundreds 
                    of days staring under the microscope, taking notes 
                    and photographs, and comparing archeological tools with more 
                    experimental ones. Tedious work to be sure, but the result 
                    will be a much more complete view of what Clovis peoples were 
                    doing with their finely made stone tools.</p>
                  <h3>How Long Did They Stay?</h3>
                  <p class="text">Among the things that are missing from the Gault 
                    site are organic remains, especially charred plant remains. 
                    The preservation conditions are such that so far not a single 
                    charcoal fragment has been found from the lower Paleoindian layers (although many matrix samples 
                    have been saved for further analysis). Charred plant remains 
                    could reveal many important clues and they could be used for 
                    radiocarbon dating. At present there are no radiocarbon assays 
                    of Clovis age from the Gault site.  Several 
                    lines of evidence suggest that Clovis peoples visited the 
                    site over a long period of time and may have stayed here for 
                    prolonged periods.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Update:</strong> Since the exhibit was created in 2001, the Gault project has obtained a series of infrared stimulated (IRSL) dates from soil samples, a process that can determine when minerals in the soil were last exposed to the sun. The resulting dates nicely match the relative dates indicated by the distinctive artifact styles and give dates of around 13,000 years ago for the Clovis occupations at Gault. </p>
                  <p class="text">The stratigraphy of the Gault site is very complex. 
                    Because it lies within a narrow stream valley with deep deposits, 
                    permanent springs, and multiple channels coming together, 
                    the character of the deposits can change dramatically over 
                    the space of a few meters (6-10 feet). It was a &quot;dynamic&quot; 
                    environment, meaning that things could and did change quickly. 
                    Major floods, for instance, changed the stream course repeatedly, 
                    ripping up old deposits and creating new ones. As the continuing 
                    excavations connect now-isolated excavation units and as various 
                    geological and soils experts study the many samples that have 
                    already been taken, entire books will probably be written 
                    about the stratigraphy of the Gault site. But based on what 
                    we know today, there are at least three distinct Clovis &quot;components&quot; 
                    at Gault. </p>
                  <p class="text">That is, in various places in the site there 
                    are at least three distinct layers containing Clovis artifacts. 
                    Their nature implies that these formed over extended periods 
                    of time, decades at least and probably centuries. In the lowest 
                    and hence earliest Clovis deposits, there are the bones of 
                    mammoth, horse, and bison, all species that became extinct 
                    at the end of the last Ice Age. In the later, upper two deposits 
                    the only large bones that have been found are those of extinct 
                    bison. Given this, it is possible that mammoth and horse became 
                    extinct (at least locally) during the Clovis era at Gault. 
                     
                    It is obvious that a considerable period of time elapsed during 
                    the Clovis occupations at Gault, several hundred years at 
                    least and probably more. Based on the IRSL dates, 
                    the Gault site could have been occupied as early as 12,000 B.C. and as late as  10,900 B.C.</p>
                  <p class="text">Textbooks will tell you that Clovis points were 
                    specifically designed for mammoth hunting. Yet, in the upper 
                    (and latest) Clovis deposits at Gault it appears that no change 
                    in weaponry was made after the extinction of the mammoths. 
                    The Clovis points are still the classic form and they are 
                    found with bison remains. Collins thinks this is another indication 
                    that Clovis technology was a generalized rather than specialized 
                    one. The prevailing concepts are ripe for reconsideration.</p>
                  <p class="text">This still leaves the question of the nature 
                    of the occupations: were these intermittent, as seems most 
                    likely, or continuous? Researchers aren't sure yet and may 
                    never be certain, but there are indications that the occupation(s) 
                    may have been lengthy. The most obvious is the sheer quantity 
                    of materials and size of the site&#151;this must have taken 
                    either lots of visits or a fair number of people over lengthy 
                    spans of time. </p>
                  <p class="text">Another clue is the amount of exotic lithic 
                    materials. One of the most characteristic aspects of the stone 
                    tools at most Clovis sites is that the discarded, worn-out-stone 
                    tools are more often than not made of exotic non-local materials. 
                    Many studies have shown that Clovis peoples routinely carried 
                    or traded flint and other stones hundreds of miles from their 
                    sources. But at Gault, exotic materials are very uncommon, 
                    even among the worn-out tools such as Clovis points that were 
                    broken and dulled and resharpened until they were too small 
                    to be useful. Although no counts are yet available, the overwhelming 
                    majority of all stone tools and tool-making materials at Gault 
                    are made of the local flint. This strongly suggests that Gault 
                    hunters commonly started and ended their trips at Gault and 
                    that they did this throughout the history of the site.</p>
                  <h3>Putting It All Together: Clovis Reconsidered</h3>
                  <p class="text">Based on the evidence just reviewed and on arguments 
                    and data presented by many other researchers in recent years, 
                    a new view of Clovis culture is taking hold. Clovis peoples 
                    may not have been the pioneers who first settled North America. 
                    Leaving aside the direct evidence for preClovis sites, there 
                    is this: Clovis artifacts are known from all 48 of the lower 
                    states plus southernmost Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and northern South America. 
                    These continent-wide localities occupy a tremendous range 
                    of environments, from coastlines to mountains and almost everything 
                    between. The inescapable conclusion from these facts alone 
                    is that most Clovis peoples were NOT highly mobile, specialized 
                    mammoth hunters&#151;they were generalized hunter-gatherers 
                    who must have relied on animals of all sizes and a great many 
                    plants. The emerging data from the Gault site lend very strong 
                    support to this interpretation.</p>
                  <p class="text">In addition to what has already been mentioned, 
                    here are several more examples of the kinds of evidence from 
                    Gault that reinforce this view. Among the bones found in the 
                    Clovis deposits are turtle bones, burned frog bones, burned 
                    bird bones, and small mammals yet to be identified. In Clovis 
                    faunal assemblages across North America, the most commonly 
                    identified animals are not elephants&#151;they are turtles. 
                    And the Clovis diet was not based on animals alone. This, 
                    of course, is obvious anyway because humans can't live for 
                    long on just meat. But at Gault, use-wear studies are already 
                    finding evidence of a wide range of contact materials including 
                    the stunning example of the Clovis blade with the highly developed 
                    use-wear signature of grass cutting. While grass-cutting may 
                    not have been for food (the tall grasses of the Black Prairie 
                    are ideally suited for thatching and bedding), it is another 
                    indication of the diversity of behaviors that are being documented 
                    at the Gault site.</p>
                  <p class="text">It should not seem surprising at all that Clovis 
                    peoples were more than one-dimensional. They were, as we are 
                    learning at Gault and elsewhere, much more interesting people 
                    who adapted to a wide range of environments and climates and 
                    behaved like generalized hunters and gatherers of the later 
                    Archaic cultures of North America. Contrast this with Folsom 
                    culture, the quintessential specialized big game hunters of 
                    the Plains. All known Folsom sites occur within or near the 
                    Great Plains and prairies of the midcontinent. And all of 
                    the Folsom sites with animal bones have extinct bison bones. 
                    No Folsom caches are known, suggesting perhaps that Folsom 
                    peoples were so mobile and so focused on &quot;encounter&quot; 
                    hunting strategies, that they did not plan ahead by caching 
                    materials for the future. Folsom peoples did not make much 
                    use of the prismatic blade technology, perhaps because blade 
                    cores are heavy things that don't travel well. The ultra-thin 
                    Folsom bifaces are light and the thinning flakes struck from 
                    them well suited for making Folsom points and other artifacts. 
                    Clovis is anything but Folsom-like.</p>
                  <p class="text">For now, this is where we leave the story of 
                    Gault and of Clovis reconsidered. Clovis culture will never 
                    be seen again in the same light, as it has for so long. The 
                    Clovis-first hypothesis&#151;with all its implications of 
                    specialized big-game hunters&#151;is all but shattered. While 
                    it hasn't been proved beyond doubt that preClovis peoples 
                    existed in North America, Clovis peoples weren't anything 
                    like those described by the long-held ideal. If they were 
                    the first pioneers, as many archeologists still believe, they 
                    were exceptionally adaptable and extremely fast learners (not 
                    to mention prolific breeders) for whom killing mammoths was 
                    just one of many successful strategies. The results of work 
                    at the Gault site in central Texas will help lead researchers, 
                    students, and the public to a much more sophisticated and 
                    accurate understanding of Clovis culture.</p>
