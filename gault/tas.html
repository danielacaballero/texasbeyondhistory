            <p class="text">In June 2001, the Texas Archeological Society held 
              its Annual Field School at the Gault site and other nearby localities. 
              An average of 120 TAS members per day worked at the Gault site excavating 
              and manning the water screens. Others helped with the laboratory 
              processing, took part in a regional survey, and worked at the Bowmer 
              site elsewhere in Bell County. Here are a few of the many scenes 
              of the work in progress at Gault.  </p>
